This job is eating me alive.
I can't breathe anymore.
I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat.
I'm not becoming like them.
I am them.
Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?
I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
What's up?
Get it together, man. Okay?
So the store was hit about two hours ago.
They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras.
[Keyboard playing '80s hip-hop beat]
[Music stops]
Sorry.
I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store.
I'd also like to apologize for my partner.
His parents didn't give him enough attention.
Uh, Detective...
I already solved the case.
We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.
And how do you know that?
I had an informant on the inside.
He's been here for years.
Watching, learning. Waiting.
His code name?
Fuzzy Cuddle bear.
He's a nanny cam.
[Scoffs] You got lucky.
No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera.
Oh! Hi, bad guys!
You did it, fuzzy. You busted 'em.
It's time to come home.
[As fuzzy] I'm not sure if I can.
I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am.
I have seen terrible things.
I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons.
All right.
Detective Santiago!
Don't walk away from me!
[Rock music]
Jake: Yes, I did crack the case.
So, Santiago, would you do the honors?
[Sighs]
All: Ohhh!
I hate this!
Jake: Ah, yeah.
I hate this.
And you're just gonna add one.
I'm winning.
[Applause]
It's a good feeling.
It's a good feeling. Yeah.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
I will!
JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?
Yeah! Good news for all you murder fans.
[Laughter]
Earlier this morning...
Someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Henry Morgenthau.
Body was found by the cleaning lady, during her interview, I deduced, using expert Detective work, that she had something super gross on her chin.
[All groaning]
I think it was flan.
Charles thinks it was flan.
I think it was butterscotch pudding.
Maybe it was just old person gunk.
You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
Oldie gunk. Could be, yeah.
Anyone else?
How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?
Crime techs are at the scene now.
We're heading back when they're done.
Okay, I want you on this.
It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O.
Wait, tell us about the new Captain.
Captain Holt will be here soon.
He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.
Hey, Gina.
You know any scalpers?
I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.
Okay, two points to make here.
First, Rihanna...
You...
And then Rihanna.
Yeah. What's your second point?
She's got a type.
Which is really anyone but you.
Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.
Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man.
I don't know.
She's into watching old movies.
Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?
Oh, yeah, just go on the lnternet and search for the phrase ""I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me.""
Great. Thank you.
Good.
Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?
Uh, no, and I don't care.
I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best.
He was terrible.
You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
On your marks, get set...
Go.
What the hell's going on around here?
Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?
Okay.
And go!
[Laughter]
Yeah!
What's your point?
If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor.
I need my rabbi.
Sorry, dude...
But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with...
[Robotically] Following every rule in the patrol guide.
Meep morp zeep. Robot Captain Engage.
Is that what you think?
He-hey!
New Captain alert. [Laughs]
You must be the new C.O.
I'm Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
Now don't let me interrupt.
You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be.
I'd like you to finish.
That's not necessary.
Or I could recap very quickly, sure.
Um, let's see.
I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.
Now do the robot voice.
Which...
The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot.
I wanna hear it again.
Meep morp... zarp.
Robot.
That's a terrible robot voice.
Yep.
The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.
Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties.
Well, your new Captain does.
And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.
Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt.
Speech!
That was my speech.
Short and sweet.
Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
Yes, sir.
[Sighs] I love that guy.
Same!
He's so suave.
Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe?
No? Okay.
Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me...
Though you were significantly...
Fatter, sir.
They called me ""Terry Titties.""
Because I had large, uh...
Titties, yes. I remember.
I never liked that nickname.
Though to be fair, it was accurate.
What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?
A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls.
Cagney and Lacey.
They have adorable chubby cheeks.
Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.
Lost my edge.
There was an incident in a department store.
Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
[Clanging]
Ahhh!
[Gun clicks]
I think he's dead.
And I'm still not right.
Tell me about your Detective squad.
[Clears throat] Um...
Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.
They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.
Copy that.
Now the good ones.
Rosa Diaz.
Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.
[Grunting]
Tell me who has me for secret santa.
No! That takes all the fun out of it.
It's Scully. He got you a scarf.
I'll make him return it.
Yes, you will.
Charles Boyle. He's a grinder.
Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else.
He's not physically gifted.
Oh, man! My muffin.
Ahh!
Oh, my head! My muffin, my head!
And I stepped on the...
On my muffin!
And my head and my muffin.
Amy Santiago.
She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.
Careful. That stuff's pretty hot.
Oh, is it? Hmm?
She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.
Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.
Tell me about Peralta.
Jacob Peralta is my best Detective.
He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.
The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
That was very well put.
I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
Look, you know my history.
You know how important this is to me.
This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn.
And I need your help.
Absolutely, sir.
Where do we start?
♪ What is happening?
We start with him.
Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had s*x with the dish rack.
Shell casing found here. Two shots.
Bang, bang.
Great work, Detective.
You get a tie.
Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk.
That's right, Charles. Good solve.
Tie for you.
Thanks!
Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes unless you're wearing a tie.
Lay off the Captain.
That man is gonna be my rabbi.
Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment.
Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.
Yeah, he's a little too serious.
What do you think, Rosa?
He seems cool.
Yeah, he seems cool. I agree.
Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon lberico ham, valued at... what!
$6,000.
$6,000 for a ham?
Jamon lberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.
They had it at my uncle's funeral.
I gorged myself at that funeral.
I mean, I was constipated for three days.
Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you.
[Laughing] All right, listen up, everybody.
Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation.
Speaking of ties, where's yours, meep morp?
This is fantastic.
Captain! Hey!
Welcome to the murder. What are you doing here?
I like to know what my detectives are up to.
That okay by you?
Yep.
Take Santiago and knock on doors.
See if the neighbors heard anything.
Door duty? It's a waste of time.
Diaz and Boyle. Check in the coroner.
Report back to me in an hour.



[Sighs] That went well.
No, it didn't.
He's got like super hearing.
Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa!
Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week.
Wanna go?
Sure.
Cool! Awesome.
There's a bunch of movie options.
I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.
Good call. Smart.
I'll do it.
I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
Holt: So Gina...
Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground.
What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
I will tell you on six conditions.
Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves.
Second... How about this?
If you tell me...
Mm-hmm.
I won't have you suspended...
Without pay.
Oh, that sounds great.
Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.
It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet.
If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.
He guarantees it will end in s*x.
I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.
At the very least, some touching...
No, that's enough, Gina.
Caresses.
I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
That's enough, Gina.
All right.
Thank you.
Jake: Let the wasting of time begin.
[Knock on door]
Hello, sir.
Can we ask you a few questions?
Definitely. Yeah.
I'm actually... I'm super glad you guys are here right now.
Are you smelling that weed smell?
Both: Yeah.
'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted.
[Laughing] It's...
Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?
Yes.
Police!
Hello.
Hello.
What's your name?
My name?
Mm-hmm.
Mlepnos.
Can you spell that, please?
M-l-e-p...
Clay.
Did you say ""Clay""?
Yes, the ""Clay"" is silent.
All right, got it.
Have you seen this man before? He was shot last night.
Oh. Thank you.
No, sir, that's ours. We need that.
We...
And he kept it.
Wall Street journal on the doormat...
Top floor apartment.
20 bucks says this guy's like a hot, eligible bachelor.
I'll take that action.
Police! Open up!
Hello.
[Laughing] Oh! Hello, sir!
How are you today?
I am Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective.
No surprises from the coroner.
A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.
None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.
And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old.
That is not accurate, sir.
Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh!
All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood.
And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.
Jake: Oh, actually, sir...
I'm wearing a tie right now.
Check it out.
Secret tie.
First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping.
But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?
Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately?
Hmm. Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.
I wanna be briefed on any new developments.
Any questions?
I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one.
So I'm good.
Hey, Boyle.
Yep.
What about this fancy ham stuff?
Jamon lberico.
Yes.
The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham? It doesn't make sense.
Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it?
Beneficio's might.
Let's go.
You gotta brief the C.O. first.
We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
My name is Ratko. I don't know anything.
Oh, okay.
You recognize this guy?
Henry Morgenthau?
No.
Maybe actually look at the picture.
I don't know him. I don't know what happened.
No more questions.
Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think?
You do know Morgenthau.
He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.
You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.
Only he was home, so you shot him.
Does that sound familiar?
Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory?
Great idea.
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
So I'm... I'm Ratko.
No, no, I'm Ratko.
Come on. I'm always the victim.
Look, I'm doing this with you right here.
Fine, fine. [Clears throat]
Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.
Don't I know you from the grocery store?
Kill! And scene.
Jake: NYPD! Everyone down!
Ma'am, if you could just get down, or... ignore me and continue shopping.
Boyle, get the door!
On it!
Ratko!
[Grunts] Oh!
Ow!
[Both grunting]
Ha ha ha!
Jake: Ow, Ratko, ow!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko!
I'm getting mad!
That's a waste of manchego!
Charles!
How are you still here?
Jake!
Little help!
Ratko! He's not going anywhere, Jake!
[Bottle clanging]
Ratko!
I got him! I got him!
Don't worry!
Jake: So no, I did not brief you.
And yes, he did get away.
But some bonus good news...
I got you hazelnut.
[Whispering] And...
A little spoon there for you.
[Scoffs] Is he seriously assigning me to the records room?
I mean, why do we even have a records room?
Computer's been invented, right? I didn't dream it?
You're lucky, man.
I wish I could get assigned here full-time.
You could not be farther from the action.
Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone.
Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet?
Second best.
You're wrong about Holt.
That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.
In 1981, he caught the disco strangler.
[Light disco music]
It's over, disco man!
Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.
Wow.
The man is the real deal. You need to listen to him.
Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta.
Although I did start a new category.
""Murderers we let go.""
And look at that.
You're winning.
Have fun with your files.
Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files.
Have fun with your face!
Slam!
That was a slam.
So what movie did you get us tickets to?
Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.
Just to be safe? What does that mean?
I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up.
Because you're sort of... Opinionated.
You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you.
You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.
So we can go see North by Northwest.
We're not seeing a movie together.
Good call. Smart.
Keep it profesh.
[Blowing raspberries]
[Mimics explosion]
Hey, Captain.
So you found something?
Hey, I like the tie.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Anyway, I think I got something good here.
Turns out the name ""Ratko"" is made up.
But I was digging through these files...
One of which I literally found in a spider web...
And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a serbian thug, street names ""the rat"" and ""the butcher,""
who's known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil, hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthau's counter.
That's fine work, Detective.
Thank you very much, sir.
Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately.
Let's pound it out.
You know what, such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team.
Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here!
Bring everyone! And a camera!
That's not necessary. Oh, they're here!
Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta.
Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone.
Give him a hand.
Yeah, nice!
[Cheers and applause]
[Wolf whistle] Looking good!
Yeah. Thank you.
Amy: No record of Ratko on the ledger.
Must've used cash.
Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain.
You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is?
Patrol guide says ""no dress code.""
So I'm just the zip-up hoodie and my two best friends.
Does he always talk this much?
I just tune it out.
It's like a white noise machine.
Okay, first of all, that's racist.
Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler.
That's incredible. I've read that case.
With all due respect, sir, why'd it take you so long to get your first command?
Because I'm gay.
[Chuckles] Ah.
Seriously?
I'm surprised you didn't know.
I don't try to hide it.
Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe?
[Slowed down] Manscaping.
Damn!
I am not a good Detective.
Rosa: Here.
I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.
Why don't you just go to the movies with me?
Nope.
Okay.
Well, this is awkward.
It's not awkward.
I like your company.
You're sweet.
When did you come out?
About 25 years ago.
The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective.
But then the old guard died out.
Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer.
I made Captain.
But they put me in a public affairs unit.
I was a good soldier. I helped recruitment.
But all I ever really wanted was my own command.
And now I finally got it.
And I'm not gonna screw it up.
Captain, I'm sorry. I...
I feel like a jackass.
[Sighs]
But on the flip side, there's Ratko.
Humility over. I'm amazing!
[Hip-hop music]
♪
Fantastic. 3,000 identical blue doors.
Looks like we all got door duty.
Ah, yeah. From before.
Good one. You look great.
Clear.
Clear.
[Sighs] Okay.
Unbelievable!
Un-believable!
Ah.
Ratko, great to see you.
You can't stop me.
I'm going.
Actually, you're not going anywhere.
'Cause if you take a look to your left, you'll see Detective's Boyle and Diaz.
Right there is Detective Santiago.
And behind you is Captain Holt.
Point is... My team has you surrounded.
Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing!
Captain, I just figured it out.
Maybe now's not the best time, Detective.
It's a uniform!
We're a team, and the tie is a part of that team's uniform, right?
You ask Ratko what team?
No, Ratko, shut up.
It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.
And now you're the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform.
Boom! Nailed it!
Yes, you did. Now just arrest Ratko.
All right, Ratko, down. Drop the weapon.
Hands on your head. Here we go.
Hey!
He's running!
Oh! Got him!
Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!
Boyle: Stay down.
That's how we do it in the nine-nine, sir.
Catch bad guys and look good doing it.
What's wrong with you?
Never took off the speedo. Big mistake.
It is inside me. Great work, team!

Ah, Captain. You're at my desk.
Just what I wanna see first thing in the morning.
You're three minutes late, Peralta.
Not my fault. I had a plumbing problem.
[Musical ringtone]
[Groans]
Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone.
Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?
Good idea. Everyone?
Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you.
Okay, fine. I was three minutes late.
I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong.
Oh, it's more than one thing.
Uh-oh.
Let's start with the Kristov murder.
It was an amazing solve.
I got him to confess in 20 minutes.
You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake.
Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork.
Here are two pictures.
One is your locker.
The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines.
Can you tell which is which?
That one's the dump?
They're both your locker.
Gah, I should've guessed that. He's good.
This folder is labeled ""undies, dirty.""
So I won't confuse it with ""undies, clean.""
Also, who cares about all these rules?
I have more felony arrests than any other Detective here.
You also have more mice living in your desk than any other Detective.
[Gasps] Algernon. [All aw]
You guys, Algernon's back.
Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now.
He's grumpy.
♪
Okay, detectives, let's get started.
Santiago, where are we with the Jay street drug bust?
There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment.
Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.
Dream team.
Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case.
Well, there's no easy way to put this, sarge, but someone has been painting wieners on squad cars.
[Laughter]
And apparently, they won't stop until there's a pen1s drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn.
Oh, that's what he's been drawing.
But what are those little round things at the bottom?
That's the butt.
The butt?
I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
Did you just say ""genital-man""?
Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan.
I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait.
Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here.
He's already tagged three U/C vehicles.
He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.
A minivan?
A-ha!
[Laughter]
You all got a problem with my minivan?
'Cause my wife doesn't like it either.
She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man.
They roll!
That's a good idea, sergeant. We'll take the van.
We? You're coming with me?
Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup.
It's not backup. It's babysitting.
Babysitting.
A-ha!
[Indistinct chatter]
Oh, look at this.
The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college.
Interesting, huh?
How's that interesting?
Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs.
I studied art history too.
Also not interesting.
Excuse me.
I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs?
As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you.
I do palms, tarot, and I have a degree in numerology from the lnternet.
Ugh.
Really, Gina?
A psychic?
What? She's the real deal.
E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark.
And I did.
[Rock music]
Is anyone here named Mark?
You're good.
Okay, she's had visions which, frankly, science cannot account for.
Also, she can get you amazing deals on ladies' footwear.
She's assistant manager at Leonard's designer shoes.
Vision. The drugs are in a location.
I see the color blue... She sees blue.
And yellow.
And I see the letter ""L"", ""R"", ""S"", ""T"", ""W"", ""E"", and ""B.""
So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?
Thank you, Carlene.
Your entire life is garbage.
So Holt's coming on my stakeout now?
I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along. You made a mixtape?
Yes, I still listen to cassettes.
This guy is all over me.
I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case?
It's insane.
What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program.
There is a new sheriff in town, Jake.
Well, I like the old sheriff.
I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules.
All: Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase... Hey!
What the hell's going on here?
Science experiment.
I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
Okay.
All: Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...
Ah!
[All oh]
Yeah! [Cheers and applause]
And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover, and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger.
Did he let you play your mixtape?
Okay. That's very funny.
Get an iPod, man.
Mixtape.
I just want to apologize for my fellow Detective's behavior.
Okay, my granny also had the gift.
I feel that I will die soon.
She was right. She died two years later.
Your sincere belief in my gift means a great deal.
Vision.
The woman you love, the one you work with, the scary one with the black hair...
Rosa.
Yes?
She doesn't love you back.
She will never love you back.
Say ""thank you,"" Charles.
She just told you your future.
Thank you.
You left without me. You were late again.
Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise.
Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret.
What's your cover?
Angry Captain.
Okay, so you do not like my ensemble.
I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals.
But the sandals define Harvey.
He's a sandals guy.
[Sighs]
Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me?
You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
Yes. It was a rhetorical question.
I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously.
Hey, I do take my job seriously.
I put away bad guys. That's what matters.
Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear.
That's on Harvey. That's not me.
Well, so here's the deal.
You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases.
And when you show me that you can do your job...
Every part of your job... Perfectly, then I'll back off.
Okay. Counteroffer.
I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want.
Fine. We'll do it your way.
From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly.
It's ""more perfectly."" You said that imperfectly.
I was testing you. You did perfectly.
Quick update on the tagger situation...
He is currently spray-painting our van right now.
Police, freeze!
Ow, ow, ow.
Sandal down.
Lost a sandal. NYPD, freeze!
I'm here.
You're busted.
Already got him. We got him.
Oh, hey, Captain.
Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands.
Let me do whatever I want, and the $40...
That's how much I actually have... is yours.
No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyway.
Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is: Writing a perfect report.
Good, I'm anxious to read it.
And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf.
[Howls]
Anything else, Detective?
Yeah, I'm gonna do one more.
[Howls]
Lone wolf.
He's digging me.
[Clicks tongue]



Hey, sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter?
Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly.
What are you doing, Peralta?
Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way.
[Laughs] Okay, man.
It was nice working with you. [Laughs]
I'm not scared of him, okay?
I'm not scared of anyone.
Oh, also, the tagger drew a pen1s on your minivan.
I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me.
What? There's a pen1s on my minivan?
High ceilings, three bedrooms.
Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?
You know what they don't teach you at the academy?
It's better to be a criminal.
Oh, no. The cabinets are blue.
Tacky. Not a deal breaker, though.
I'd just repaint it.
The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
[Slow motion] I see the color blue.
She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
[Slow motion] She will never love you back.
And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing.
Uh-huh.
Kitchen.
Whoa.
Jackpot.
There's way more than 12 keys in here.
Where was it?
Baseboard, behind the hamper.
What color was the hamper?
Green.
Yes.
The clothes hamper was green.
The clothes hamper was green!
Drinks on me.
[Laughs] You're weird.
[Engine starts]
Sorry this is taking so long.
Still writing up my report.
Pretty detailed.
Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?
No, sorry. Don't feel like it, no.
Thanks, Gina.
And now to you. What's your name?
My name is banana fartman, md.
I don't believe you.
Come on, man. Just tell me who you are.
I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back.
Are you a minor? How old are you?
I'm 610. I'm a highlander.
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there.
And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander.
And they're gonna cut your head off.
Is that what you want?
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong.
Mm-mm. No way. She's never wrong.
We found the cocaine behind a green hamper.
Never said green or the letter ""H.""
Mm-hmm, she said ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" Charles.
I don't know if there's any kindergarteners present, but those two colors combined make green.
She also mentioned the letters ""L"" and ""B,"" and another name for a hamper is...
Lady bin?
Laundry basket.
Oh, little boo-boo.
Can you go be depressed over there?
You're bumming out my whole area.
Baby, I've got some bad news.
Someone painted a giant pen1s on our minivan.
No, you cannot have an SUV now.
Those things roll, baby. They roll!
Hey, look at this.
Your prints were on file.
Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski.
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy police commissioner Podolski.
Your father is deputy police commissioner Podolski.
I'm not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands?
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
20.2 kilos.
I feel like we could round up to 21.
Or we could round down to 20, take the extra 0.2, sell it to our friends.
[Giggles]
I'll call the D.A. Rosa, you log this in.
Charles, maybe watch Gina.
[Laughs]
So what are you doing tonight?
Nothing. What about you...
Are doing tonight?
Nothing.
Carlene.
Whelp, I hope you find something to do.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna pee. That's what I'm doing tonight.
No.
[Sighs]
Deputy commissioner's son, huh? [Sighs]
His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now.
We gotta let him walk, right?
He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed.
Why would you let him walk? [Chuckles]
Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly.
I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps.
I even put an ""about the author"" section on the back.
I did everything you asked me to do, but this is above my pay grade.
You gotta make the call.
You're the arresting officer. It's your call.
I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job.
Yeah, but you think I should process him.
Mm-hmm.
Well, if I do, the deputy commissioner could ruin my career, and I'll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans.
Mm-hmm.
Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?
Yes.
Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa.
Who's Rosa? The woman I...
The woman who doesn't love him back.
Oh. Yes, that woman.
You know, it can be a burden to always know what's gonna happen in the future.
Don't get out of the chair.
I just had a vision of you leaving this chair and getting seriously injured.
Oh, my God.
I should probably wheel you back to your desk.
That is a great idea. Wheel you off a bridge.
[Laughs] I'm kidding.
♪ Oh, you're alone ♪
♪ Uh-oh, you're alone for life ♪
So here are my options.
One, I process Podolski's kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a Detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic.
No offense, Hitchcock. None taken.
Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter.
Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she's kind of a cute blonde named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want.
How old are you in this scenario?
Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I ""do my job right"" than whether I have a job at all.
So I'm taking suggestions.
I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us.
Okay, thank you for that, Santiago.
I'm gonna put you down for ""don't arrest,"" and I'm also going to put your phone number on every urinal in Rikers.
Don't arrest him. Just smack him. Hard.
With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I'm saying?
So you're suggesting police brutality?
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?
Hey, Scully.
Yeah?
You want this collar? Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect. The Podolski kid?
Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.
Okay. Boyle, what do you think?
I don't know, man. I'm lost.
The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle.
I-I'm at the whim of the cosmos.
All right, I'm gonna put you down for ""bummer,"" and you can hang out in that category all by yourself.
Hey, everyone.
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy, angry official here, deputy commissioner Podolski.
He's asking for you. Very angry.
Elderly, sexy, furious.
Well, my career is over.
See you at the bottom, Hitchcock. No offense.
No, none taken.
Deputy commissioner.
Where's my son?
He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion.
Hey, Peralta, when you're done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? Thanks.
Oh, deputy commissioner, didn't see you there.
Sorry for interrupting.
Amy Santiago.
[Sighs]
Trevor, what'd you do this time?
Nothing.
There you have it. He said he did nothing.
So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?
I'm saying maybe it's a possibility you made a mistake.
You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I've been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours.
You might not understand this, but Trevor is a special kid.
He makes straight ""A""s. He's going to Duke next year.
Lacrosse scholarship. Oh.
Sometimes, boys just need to be boys.
You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles.
Look, I think we can all agree that I'm ordering you to let this slide because nothing happened.
This is officially out of your hands.
Would you actually mind just checking out my report?
It's pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts.
Kinda snazzy, so...
Oh, thank you.
I'll get right to it.
Thanks. Trevor, let's go.
Have a good one.
Choo.
Yes.
What's up with the chair?
Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I'd get badly hurt, so I'm not chancing it.
Oh, man. There's no pudding cups left.
Ah! What'd you do that for?
There. Now you're hurt in this chair.
You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle.
And if you do, it won't be because some shoe salesman predicted it.
You make your own destiny.
Well, we don't have to worry about Podolski's son anymore.
The case is officially out of my hands.
No charges filed.
Why is there yogurt on this?
The deputy commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yogurt earlier.
Terry loves yogurt.
Something wrong? Kinda, yeah.
I called six precincts about this kid.
He's been brought in a dozen times.
Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he's never been processed.
His daddy comes in and bails him out every time.
He's a lucky little jerk.
No, I wouldn't say he was lucky.
I feel bad for this kid.
I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything?
Well, he's someone else's problem now.
Like you said, it's out of your hands.
All right, I see what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work.
I'm not going to arrest him. I'm going to arrest him!
You want backup?
Yes.
[Siren wails]
What is this? You can't do this.
Get that thing outta here.
Excuse me, sir.
Trevor Podolski, you're under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property.
What... dad! What are you doing?
I told you to back off, Peralta.
First off, the name's Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago.
Second, I'm arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it's the one I'm making.
Once again, my name is Amy Santiago.
You're being stupid, Peralta. Don't be stupid.
I can make your life miserable.
Commissioner, please don't talk to my Detective in that Tone.
If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me.
You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, Holt.
I'm gonna be watching you, both of you, like a hawk.
You're gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me.
I've been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you're not the first superior officer to threaten me.
You know how I'm still standing here?
'Cause I do my job, and I do it right.
Damn, son!
Don't say ""son."" Sorry.
Deputy commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he'll be at the nine-nine.
Let's go, fartman.
Carlene was wrong, Gina.
Rosa said it herself... I'm in charge of my own destiny.
That means she wants me to make a move.
Mm, but Carlene was also right.
You did get hurt 'cause Rosa punched you.
And the fact that Rosa punched you means she does not like you.
No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong.
Move.
Oh, wait, I take it back.
She definitely is into you.
So much chemistry. I know, it's crazy.
All right, let's get this meeting started.
I'm not late. I'm here.
[Alarm beeping]
Right on time.
You're out of uniform, Peralta.
Baby steps, Captain.
Baby steps.

For the last time, the best cop movies, in order: Training day, lethal weapon, and Fargo.
End of discussion.
Wrong.
Die hard is the best cop movie of all time.
One cop heroically saving the day while everyone else stands around and watches.
It's the story of my life.
I like Turner & Hooch.
Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog.
That hits me where I live.
No. Robocop.
It's got everything I like... Gratuitous violence.
Oh, I thought you were listing things.
I was. I'm done.
Okay.
Let's talk bad boys. That's the perfect cop movie.
Mr. Smith, lookin' fine.
A hot cup of tea Leone. Come on.
Francois Truffaut's breathless.
What?
Terry likes foreign films.
Mm-kay. There is a correct answer to this question, though.
So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time.
Please refrain from texting during our presentation.
Man: Excuse me, ma'am.
All right, so there's Hitchcock.
And there's an old hooker.
There it is!
Come on, guys, that happened four years ago.
Shh, this is the best part.
Takes the wallet and here she goes!
[All groan]
♪
Hey, love the sweater.
Who you slayin' tonight, lady killer?
Well, we shall see what we shall see.
No, you're dressed exactly like the lady killer.
Damn it!
This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.
All right, let's get started. Scully.
Where are you on digitizing the old case files?
As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done.
Why are you smiling?
That's nothin'.
There are thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out 200 little box thingies on 50 different screens.
At least you get to sit on your butt all day.
That's actually the worst part.
My doctor said I have an a**l canyon.
Ugh, God, Scully, why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?
I don't see anything.
That's because it's all wart.
[Retching]
How are you married?
Peralta, where are we on the Adams street burglary?
We are very close, Captain.
Aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads.
So, in conclusion, not at all close.
And the Vickers street aggravated assault?
Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved...
Due to a lack of solving it by me.
Sounds like someone's in a little bit of a slump.
I'm not in a slump.
You're not? Scoreboard.
I don't slump, people.
I opposite slump.
I p-muls.
That's ""slump"" backwards, and it's what I do.
I p-muls all over this bitch.
Dismissed.
Slump.
P-muls!
Wait... before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face.
Someone died.
No! You won a prize!
I'm not getting better at this.
I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.
All right, sir.
Let me hit you with a little analogy.
Are you familiar with race cars?
Formula I or stock?
That's already way more than I know about it.
The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps.
You got speed bumps on a race track?
Is that not part of car racing?
It should be.
All I'm saying is, it's open road again.
I'm about to close a case.
Missing grandma Helen Sterrino.
Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels and never came back.
This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly.
I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, [imitating old lady] ""That's my grandson.""
What did I say about doing voices?
I'm a storyteller, sir.
It's my craft.
Anyways, grandson's coming in.
They reunite, and I throw another case on the old ""solved it"" pile.
Hey, my croissant.
[Heavy thuds]
[Crunch]
You wanted to see me, Captain?
Yes, the D.A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay street drug bust.
That's why we do this, sir.
For praise?
Uh...
There's a community outreach program that's very important to me.
I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.
Absolutely, sir.
I won't just head it up, I will head and shoulders it up.
I will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it.
Be more articulate when you speak to the children.
Yes, sir, I will make better mouth.
Hey, sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup.
Will you be scary Terry?
Oh, I love being scary Terry.
He says what regular Terry's thinking.
This is takin' too long!
I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!
But I'm too busy.
I've got a special case I'm working on.
Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup.
Oh, great. I'll take my shirt off.
No one asked you to take your shirt off.
Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.
I can't hear you! Shirt's over my ears.
Hi, Rosa.
Ooh, I like your shoes. They're a really pretty...
What do you need?
Color. Okay.
You know how, every year, the precinct does that Junior police program seminar?
That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids...
Losers.
To sign up to become Junior police officers.
Snitches. What about it?
Captain specifically asked me to run it this year.
I signed you up to do it with me.
Here's the info.
Now I gotta read something?
Greetings. Fine.
I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.
[Scoffs] I don't need your help.
It's nothing personal, it's just...
You're not a cop, so I'm not really sure you could help.
Okay.
No hard feelings.
But I hate you.
Not joking. Bye.
[Distant siren]
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.
I'm glad you're here.
May I present to you... [Imitates trumpet fanfare]
Oh, my darlings. Thank God I found you.
Oh, look at those beautiful cheeks.
I have no idea who this lady is.
I've never seen her before in my life.
What? No, she recognized you.
This is Helen. Who's Helen?
Oh! That's my husband.
Solomon!
I'm... I'm not really her husband.
You're so much shorter than you used to be.
What did the Japanese do to you?
Different generation.
Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the prospect heights senior center.
There was an I.D. card in her back pocket.
Why was your hand in her back pocket?
Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and, unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress her butt.
Frisked! I frisked her butt!
It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta.
Oh, my God.
I'm in a slump!
Oh, cool. You're all here in the break room.
You asked us to come in here.
What? Here's a hypothetical question.
Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump.
What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that?
Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce.
So I'd tell this person, ""maybe get divorced.""
He'd have to get married first.
Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced.
Rosa?
Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
Yeah.
That's a good one.
Sarge, what would you do?
10,000 sit-ups.
Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9,500, or 3?
What's going on in here?
We're helping Jake's friend got out of his slump.
Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta.
I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump.
Thank you, Captain! He's right.
You just need a win.
Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.
Fine!
Right after I do Rosa's Montreal s*x thing.
That sounds fun. Yeah.
Okay, this is the Junior police program.
Aka ""mission possible.""
[Spy music plays on TV]
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get your life back on track.
[Coughs] Narc!
[Laughter] Hey, Gina.
What are you doing? Oh, hi, Amy.
Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn.
Do you wanna help me out here?
Nah, I think I'm good.
I know you think getting in trouble is cool.
But let me show you what can happen if you continue down this path.
Hey, yo, I'm an at-risk kid, and I think it's cool to sell drugs.
Hold up... why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black?
He's not. Well, why not?
Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs?
No, I'm not saying that.
We have a black President.
Why can't black people sell drugs?
I'm so confused.
Black people can sell drugs!
All chanting: Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Terry: [Muffled grunting]
Don't make me hit you again.
Um... I'm building this dollhouse for my girl.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
I told my wife I'd get it done.
I had the same exact one when I was a kid!
Mom, Charles is hogging my doll house!
Grandma bought it for the both of us!
You want some help, big man?
No! I can do this.
It's just driving me a little crazy.
Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?
Where do I affix it?
On the side of the turret...
Not now, Boyle.
Let a brother breathe.
Let a brother breathe.
Why would I swap cases with you?
I got multiple calls that a guy in the sackett towers is dealing meth out of his apartment.
It's a guaranteed arrest.
And therefore will have a ton of paperwork, which I know you hate.
I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence.
It's unsolvable, and thus...
Shall have no paperwork.
You had me at ""no paperwork.""
That was the very end of the sentence.
All right, Boyle.
Let's hit it.



So where are you going, Peralta?
I am on my way to ending the slump.
I got a dunker, Captain. Nothin' but net.
Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake hammer.
So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one.
I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?
Or I could solve the super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching the zodiac killer.
Am I getting ahead of myself?
No, you are not, Jake rabbit.
I like Jake hammer better. Let's go. Ah.
I did not think getting these kids to sign up would be this hard.
[Scoffs] These kids don't wanna listen to you.
You're like... Smart and articulate.
So are you!
Why am I offended by that?
They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am.
Follow, watch, learn.
All right, listen up.
I know you think you're badasses.
But deep down, you're scared.
How do I know?
Because I've been that same scared kid.
And if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail.
Got it?
Remix, yo!
[Autotuned singing]
♪ Throwing you in jail ♪
♪ Throwing you in jail ♪
[Laughter]
♪ Got it?
♪ Throwing you in jail What's happening?
I think they're laughing at you.
That's never happened before.
I don't like it. ♪ got it?
Freeze!
NYPD, hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot! I was just practicing my minuets, but I'll hold it down.
All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment?
Where's the dealer? I live here alone with my birds.
What, you don't think I know this M.O.?
These are mules.
They're drug mules.
They're bird mule drugs.
Drug bird mules.
Apartment's clear.
We got multiple calls about a dealer here.
I bet it's the silly kids down the hall.
They love prank calling me.
The only drugs in this apartment are for my heart, my liver, my kidney, my salivary glands, and my pen1s and my feet.
Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder.
No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder.
I'm telling you, it's good luck.
No, it isn't, okay?
That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible.
Fore, comin' in!
Oh, come on. I was at the crime scene.
This guy comes up out of nowhere, confesses.
Well, he says he's gotta make things right, so helps me track down his accomplices.
That is so great, man.
Looks like everything's comin' up Hitchcock.
Hey, Jake. You busy?
Yes, I very clearly am busy.
The medical examiner's office just called.
They mishandled some evidence.
So the D.A.'s gonna have to dismiss your last two busts.
[Sighs] Great.
And the slump gets worse.
I don't think it's a slump.
Honestly, you are straight-up cursed.
Good to know.
Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina?
There's no more left.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Hey.
You're dripping on my carpet.
Oh, don't worry, sir. It's just urinal water.
Clean urinal water.
You could eat off his shirt.
Why would I ever eat off his shirt?
Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed.
Cursed, huh?
The freakiest things have been happening to me.
I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life.
Birds are unloading on me left and right.
And, two seconds ago...
Hey, sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here? I...
Cursed.
Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before.
It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8.
Detective Smith.
We called him smitty.
He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed.
But then he found a case, and he solved it, and now he's married to Kate Upton.
No. No one would go out on calls with him.
He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team.
It was actually quite violent.
Man...
Girls are so scary.
I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta.
I'm pulling you from casework.
You can digitize old files with Scully.
You're benching me?
No, no, no, look... I've got a plan.
Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me 20 fresh ones.
Eventually, my luck will turn.
No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad.
Not until this blows over.
And how long will that be?
Could be a week, could be a month.
Could be a year. Could be a decade.
Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers.
I don't know how to connect with these kids.
They're mean and shallow and respect nothing.
I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to?
Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little Tupperware containers.
It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it.
Hitchcock: Sorry!
Hey, Gina. That's a super cute...
What do you want?
Sweater. Okay.
Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.
Mm, I thought only cops could help.
In this case, not being a cop might actually be better. Mm, that's true.
In all cases, cops are the worst.
""Enter the numbers from this report into the corresponding boxes on the screen. Then fill out these fields.""
And I'm in a coma.
Hey, Hitchcock.
Help me out, man. I'm so bored.
Let me jump back on that murder with you.
No. I got it.
Come on, man, let me just...
No, don't touch it! You're contagious.
Everything could fall apart!
Geraldo, leave Hitchcock alone!
Come here.
I got in touch with smitty.
He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck.
Okay? Now you try it.
Okay.
Yep.
It's definitely helping.
I can feel it.
The curse is lifting off of me.
Ah, hand cramp!
Rub, rub, rub.
[Groaning]
[Whimpering]
You okay?
The fairy princess castle has defeated me.
I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain.
I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours.
Why does it have to be so hard?
Look... this screw has three pointy sides.
And nowhere to screw it in!
[Screw clatters on floor]
And there's wheels.
What kind of castle has wheels?
[Screams]
All right... [Shouting]
117a. Yes.
117b. Yes.
118a.
Wait a minute.
Hey, just heading to the can.
Take the rabbit's foot.
Roger that.
Hey. What's going on? Hey.
Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here.
So what you're saying is that this is kind of a... No, for the last time, Charles, we don't need a clubhouse.
Clubhouse!
[High-pitched singsong] Clubhouse.
You know what I'm thinking...
No clubhouse.
I need you to make these calls for me.
Don't let Holt see you.
But if my hunch is right, the slump is over.
Come through for me, Boyle.
You know I will. All right.
I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here.
Go!
Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers.
Is that a trucker hat? Still?
Come on. Your problem...
Is that you don't have passion for anything.
My life turned around when I found my passion.
And today, well, I hope to inspire you with it.

[Sighs] What are we thinking?
Yes, in the denim.
I think I speak for everyone when I say your weird dancing was just weird.
Fine. Cops make $52,000 a year.
You never have to stop at a red light.
And you get to carry a gun. Who wants in?
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Yes. Oh, my God.
You got eight kids to sign up.
How did you know that would work?
That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.
You did this program? Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It does not work.
They're here.
Fantastic.
Too dramatic?
No. Hi.
Why are we in the bathroom?
I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time.
But first, I know what happened to your grandma.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed.
I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before.
Five missing persons reports in five different states.
Recognize this?
What are you accusing us of?
Probably insurance fraud.
Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice.
Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom.
It's because you're full of crap.
Blammo! Jake hammer strikes again.
Jake hammer strikes again.
Detectives.
I see we got eight recruits for the Junior police program.
Outstanding.
Thank you, sir.
But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina.
She's the one that got through to the kids.
Yes, I am amazing.
And I only ask for one thing in repayment.
A 600% raise. Or...
I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing.
I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good the job.
No, I have no talents.
You start Monday.
Ugh.
Constantly getting Holt's approval is the worst.
Yes. I can only imagine.
Well, the curse is over. The slump is done.
Jake is back.
Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir?
Permission denied.
Too late. [Camera snaps]
Ah, that was a good one.
So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?
Ah, maybe.
All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases.
[Deep breath]
And I now see that that was your plan all along.
And that you're capable of smiling.
All talented detectives have their ups and downs, Peralta.
So you think I'm talented.
You said it. No takebacks.
You know why Boyle doesn't slump?
Because his whole life is a slump?
Because he doesn't let adversity get him down.
He keeps grinding.
If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again.
You need to stay out of your own head.
Okay. But, sir, I don't get it.
If that was your plan, why bother with smitty and the rabbit's foot?
Well, there's a very good reason for that.
I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh...
Messing with you.
Oh...
I see what's going on here.
We're becoming homies.
Office Christmas card candidate, right here!
Me and Holt are homies!
Hey, sarge.
I assembled the castle for you.
Here it is.
Oh, my God.
What happened to all the princess flourishes?
Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station.
You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers.
Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?
Thank you, Boyle.
I appreciate it.
You're a good dad.
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.
Oh, check this out.
Working siren.
[siren blares] I'll fix that!
I'll fix... I'll fix that.

I'm so glad we could finally do this.
I know, Kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct.
Yeah.
[Phone rings]
Speaking of, this is work.
Sorry.
What's up, Peralta?
Captain called. He needs everybody back.
There's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
We're looking for a white male, 5'10"", medium build, brown hair, small scar on his right cheek.
Okay.
His M.O. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van.
It's pretty gnarly.
Last seen wearing a salmon shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce in his mouth.
Okay. Where are you?
Apparently has the world's smallest pen1s and doesn't know how to use it...
Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss. That's not true.
What are you doing here?
I'm here on a date.
Who is now leaving.
Worth it. Have a great night.
Your boss seems really nice.
He's not my boss.
Yes, I am!
♪
And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead.
Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week?
We heard.
Really? How?
Five felonies in one week!
Light 'em up, Boyle.
[Cheers and applause]
That's the sweet taste of triumph.
You should shower more.
Yep.
Updates on open cases.
I just got a DOA on Bessimer street.
You're the primary, you're in charge.
Take Diaz and Peralta.
Yes.
My fantasy threesome.
Of cops on a case.
Detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due.
I want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow.
Scully, you can just write ""I didn't close any"" on a piece of paper.
You got it.
I already got my paperwork in, Captain.
Then I guess this little reminder isn't for you.
Wow, looks like he hates you even more than me.
No, he doesn't.
We have a good relationship.
We're on the same page.
Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago?
No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was the one that was talking.
God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever.
Joke's on you.
I skipped fourth grade.
Santiago, anything else?
No. No?
Uh-uh.
Holt: Dismissed.
Hey, Boyle. I know you haven't had Peralta as a secondary in a while.
Be careful.
It can be rough.
Hey, saboteur, that's not true.
I happen to be a very good secondary.
So you were just borrowing those cars?
Peralta: Ask about his bank account.
Ask about his bank account!
Ask him about his bank...
Account.
You should ask him about his bank account.
Captain, Santiago broke the glass.
You can't give up control, you're terrible at taking your primary's orders, you just do whatever you want.
I could go on and on and on.
Is something no lover of yours has ever said.
Blammo.
Look, I can be an amazing secondary and I'll prove it.
I know you will, Jake-in-the-box.
Okay, don't ever call me that again.
I'm driving. We should leave now.
Carry my bag.
But you should pick the music, primary.

It's a great picture, sir.
I hate it.
Me too.
So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case.
Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick.
How do you want me to proceed?
Figure it out, Santiago. It's your case.
Yes. I will do that.
Thank you.
Are you bowing?
No.
This is how I walk.
What do you need, Quasimodo?
I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta.
Is there something wrong with the Captain?
It seems like he's in a bad mood.
I don't know. Who can tell?
You all right, Captain?
Tough weekend?
I went to Barbados with my husband.
We wove hats out of Palm fronds and swam with the stingrays.
I've never been happier.
Guy's impossible to read. Don't even try.
Holt: That is, without question, the funniest story I've ever heard.
Wow.
This guy must have weighed 500 pounds.
I think we have an idea what killed him.
Spoiler alert: It was not starvation.
Both: What do we got?
Sorry, sorry.
You're the primary, you're in charge.
Frank Patterson.
58 years old, married, no children.
Wife found him this morning and called it in.
Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?
No.
You sure about that?
Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic struggle with his stomach.
[Laughs]
What are you thinking, Boyle?
All ri... I'm calling natural causes.
We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator.
And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist.
This case is open and shut.
Just like his mouth was, constantly.
That was my last fat joke.
Okay?
Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom.
Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom.
I'll take the kitchen.
Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
It's... it's so weird.
He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it. It's weird.
Hey, sergeant.
You know how you're really good at doodling?
I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult.
You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?
Sorry.
Can you please draw a perp for me?
The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away.
He's in a bad mood.
Is he?
I can never read him.
You look chipper, Captain.
You have a fun weekend?
There was a small fire in my home.
I lost many photo albums of treasured memories.
I'm devastated.
I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him.
Can you help me out?
Great.
Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?
Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo...
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
Let's start with the eyes.
Were they desperate? Lonely?
Did they betray heartache?
They were brown.
Do you even want your purse back?
So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles.
Is that your idea of being a good secondary?
First off, I've told four.
And second, I'm helping.
I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth.
Five fat jokes.
Thanks, Arnie.
[Laughs]
See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great.
Arnie, shut up.
Jake, for once, just hang back and let Boyle do his job.
[Groans] Fine.
Unless I get a direct order from Boyle I will stand here motionless like a wise, old oak tree.
You look like an idiot.
I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson.
Can you talk about what happened after breakfast?
I took the dog for a walk.
When I came back, he was dead.
I'm just in shock.
We were going on a cruise together next week.
He had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package.
I'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.
Motion reactivated.
Hey.
Detective Jake Peralta.
Dr. Rossi. I'm the new medical examiner.
Don't let me get in your way.
I'm sure you have a lot to do.
Actually, I've been given a direct order to do nothing, so.
What brings you here...
Okay. All right.
Sorry. Sorry.
You all right?
What's up?
How's the Patterson case looking?
It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy results tomorrow.
Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E.
My man is all over it.
I'm really glad you could sneak away from your case.
Well, it's technically not really my case, but on the plus side, I have all the time in the world.
Oh.
To you.
And to the ginormous, dead fat man who brought us together.
[Laughs]
Boyle: Hey, Jake.
Have you heard anything from the M.E.?
She hasn't sent the autopsy report.
Oh, that's strange.
Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy?
That's definitely what happened.
Okay, just let me know when she calls.
You got it.
[Clears throat]
Hey, can I ask you guys something?
Can you keep a secret?
Do you know anything about my life?
No, I do not. Good point.
Okay, so you know the new medical examiner?
I kinda had s*x with her last night.
What?
Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to.
s*x is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other.
He's right, Santiago. Do you not know that?
I meant, what were you thinking?
She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles.
The guy died of natural causes.
What's the big deal?
Anyways, back to last night.
As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy.
Wait. Close your eyes.
Oh, okay.



[Yelps]
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
What are you doing?
I like 'em cold.
Okay...
Not that weird.
Cold? Like a dead guy?
You're reading into that.
Am I?
You have a really nice chest.
Thank you.
I'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
Okay...
I wonder how much your appendix weighs.
[Gasps] Oh.
It's inflamed.
All right.
Wait, that's bad, right?
Yeah, it is.
Oh, no.
Ew!
Please tell me you ran out of there.
No.
For some reason I kinda started getting into it.
Oh, what do we have here?
A 34-year-old caucasian male who is dead.
Very dead.
Mmm.
Cause of death?
Initial assessment: Blunt force trauma.
But what do I find when I probe a little farther?
Bruising around the neck.
And ocean water in the lungs.
Ooh, how long have you been dead, body?
Four days.
Gross. Bloating. Odors.
Oh, uh, 24 hours.
Perfect.
Here we go.
Stop, stop, stop! Weird, weird, weird!
Rosa, what's your call? Weird or sexy?
Weird.
I knew it.
But also kinda sexy?
No. Weird.
But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?
Told ya.
Worst secondary in the unit.
What do you guys want from me?
You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary.
I blow off work to have s*x with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary.
I can't win.
What are you guys talking about?
Um, just weird s*x stuff that has nothing to do with work.
I once had s*x on a futon.
And it was in couch mode.
Hmm.
Sarge, all of these are fine.
How much longer are you gonna work on this?
It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear.
You can't put a clock on art.
Ten minutes.
Great.
Let's catch this guy so we can give Holt some good news.
I wanna cheer him up.
Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood?
I mean, it's impossible to read that guy.
This is the most incompetent, worthless report I have ever read in my life!
Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement!
It's like, ""what's that guy thinking?""
You know?
I can read him.
And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me.
He and I are exactly the same.
Except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight.
Captain Holt's not gay.
Captain Holt's gay?
Seriously, man, just retire.
Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA?
Still waiting on the autopsy report.
Supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing.
This is unacceptable.
I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.
Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah.
That's not necessary, sir.
For the record, I think it's natural causes anyway, but I'm also the secondary in this case.
It's my responsibility, so I will head on down there and pick up the report.
Good.
But don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.
Right, I don't know...
Bup-bup-bup-bup... Bup-bup-bup.
Just go.
Yep, I am going to regret teaching him that one.
Rosa, can I show you something?
What's up?
Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked.
Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die.
Huh, nice find, Boyle.
This could be a murder.
Where's that autopsy?
Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago.
He still hasn't got back to me.
Jake went to get the autopsy report?
I know. Isn't he the best?
I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary.
I wanna get him something nice.
Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?
You know what?
We better go down there.
See what's holding him up.
Good call.
Detectives. [Clears throat]
Hello.
Shirt's buttoned wrong.
Dr. Rossi: Huh. So it is.
Well, how can I help you?
Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report.
Hmm.
Is Detective Peralta here?
I haven't seen him.
Thanks for coming by.
Peralta: [Coughing]
Hold on.
Found him.
Ah, thank goodness you're here.
I am so lost.
Do you know where the vending machines are?
Look, it's not what it seems like.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is. Here's what happened.
I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Cut the crap, Peralta.
Look, I'm sorry I slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes.
Not anymore. We think it could be a murder.
Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?
Murder murder.
We need the autopsy to be sure.
I have not gotten to that yet.
You guys have been down here for two hours.
What, did you have s*x 40 times?
40 times?
No, Charles, like...
Look, I'm sorry.
We didn't know it was a homicide.
Well, it shouldn't matter.
I'm your primary and I asked you to do something.
So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you.
It's more than okay.
It's okay times two.
Now, Dr. Rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now?
Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up.
Guilty.
Okay, fine.
I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary.
How gross could it be?
Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity for me.
Oh. Wow.
Okay, I can do that. It's no big deal.
Just like holding open some slimy elevator doors.
For a family of aliens... Oh, my God.
Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.
Oh, will you look at that stomach lining?
God, that is just a beaut.
Ugh.
All right.
I'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand...
[Groans]
Yep, get it down there.
[Groans]
Get it down there.
Get it on in.
[Groans]
There you go.
Oh, that is so big.
Caught him?
Yes, sir.
He was easy to pick up.
He looked just like the sergeant's sketch.
You could be a professional artist, boss.
Like on the boardwalk.
You think I should draw caricatures?
That's garbage art!
I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!
I'm saying you could. You're that good.
Captain, the credit really goes to sergeant Jeffords.
Without his refined artistic skills...
Finish the paperwork by noon.
I want it included in the crime stats.
I gotta say, I always hate how I look in pictures, but that is so flattering.
Also, I'm innocent.
You got the wrong guy.
Shut up.
Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me.
What?
It'll cheer the Captain up.
He'll be over the moon.
He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly.
This is a lot of pressure.
If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right.
Scully, get me my oils.
Paint or massage?
I'll get both.
You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen.
It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli.
Sure you want me to keep digging?
Unfortunately, yes.
If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder.
Okay. Here we go.
Oh.
Wanna see something cool?
No.
Here it is.
That's what I'm talking about.
[Gasps] Listen.
Goosh.
Mm-hmm.
You know what that was?
That was the air releasing from the large intestine.
[Sighs] In the biz, we call that ""the death bubble."" It's pretty cool.
Here, you wanna hold it?
No!
Knock knock.
You can knock with your hands.
Saying it is ridiculous.
Okay.
Well, I know you're having a bad day...
I think you're having a bad day.
So, to cheer you up I had Terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated.
I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious to hang pictures of yourself.
Especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.
Oh.
But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator.
What? No ornate gold frame?
Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor?
We could add a horse.
You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher.
Oh, I did.
It's already in the system.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Good.
Thank you. Dismissed.
Here are the contents of his stomach.
Oh, that's where they went.
And here's the really cool part.
Get in here, look at the scarring on this liver.
Cause of death: Poison.
Ingested.
Boyle was right.
All right, I'm gonna go tell him.
Yeah, you could.
Or you could stay for a post-mortem.
Nope. Sorry.
The spell has worn off.
No more weird dead guy s*x for me ever again.
It's nothing personal, I just think s*x is for the living.
Isn't that right, buddy?
Oh, my God, he has no eyes!
Oh, that is terrifying.
What now, Santiago?
I figured out why you've been so tense.
You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.
That's not your concern.
I just checked the stats myself.
Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here.
They're exactly the same as last month.
If this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring.
Sir, I don't think you realize how good flat numbers are.
I went back 12 years.
A precinct's numbers almost always get worse under new leadership, but ours didn't.
That's a win.
It's just your first month.
Morale is much higher, people are working harder, you're well on your way to earning a place on that wall.
Thank you, Santiago.
You know, we're birds of a feather, you and I.
I hate cliches.
Cliches are the worst. Okay.
We know you killed your husband.
That cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison.
And for the record, the inside of his body was very gross.
Noted.
My only question is, why'd you do it?
Um, he drove me to it.
He had affair after affair.
He was a real don Juan.
Permission to make a fat joke? Granted.
Are you sure you didn't mean ""don flan""?
Thanks. Nice.
Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.
Sarge, that painting is tight.
It's terrible.
The brushwork is sloppy.
There's poor use of negative space.
I'm a fraud.
Not at all.
I'd like to take this home for my husband.
He'll be glad you made me look so happy.
I was trying to make him look serious.
I still can't read him.
No one can.
I can.
He likes it.
Diaz: Nice job, Boyle.
You nailed it.
Here.
Of course he did. He's a great primary.
And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two.
I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry.
What a wonderful moment.
I agree, it is a wonderful moment.
What a wonderful moment. Rosa, do you agree?

You guys stay here and keep celebrating.
You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy s*x?
[Laughs]
We will never speak of that again.
Never.
Okay, bye.
God. Crazy day, huh?
I hate small talk.
Let's drink in silence.
Perfect.

Hey, you guys see the dude I brought in today...
The drug dealer? 81 years old.
I think it's the oldest collar of my entire career.
I once arrested a 96-year-old for flashing.
I was terrified he'd die in my backseat...
Or flash me.
My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20.
What about two 50-year-old twins?
Does that count as a 100-year-old?
Amy: No good.
No.
You talking oldest bags? 68.
That's not that old. Yeah, but I was only 20.
20? Were you even a cop then?
No, man, it was before I got into the academy.
Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.
All: Ew!
No... yes, I am.
Yeah, oldest arrest... 68, like I said.
God, you had s*x with a 68-year-old when you were in your 20s?
You know how it is.
When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you...
No, that is not an older woman. That's an old woman!
That's someone's grandma!
She was, actually. That's how I met her.
Went to college with her grandson Marvin.
Don't... don't knock it till you try it.
She had a replacement hip with some serious torque.
It was like having s*x with a transformer.
No. That is no one's fantasy.
♪
Terry: Peralta...
Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?
Well, like I told Captain Holt earlier this week, we are at the one-yard line. It's a football reference.
Yes, Jake. I played linebacker at Syracuse.
Really? In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees.
Yeah, you don't want to brag about that.
Peralta, you want to loop everyone in?
Ehh...
That was not a request.
Fine. [Groans]
Get ready for some stuff on a screen.
Meet Fred Gorman...
Prominent citizen, lawyer, corpse.
Now meet his wife, Ann Hoert.
She did not take his last name, but I believe she did take his life.
Nice.
Thank you, Charles.
Now, Hoert had means, motives, and opportunity.
I just need to find the murder weapon.
For some reason, the D.A. won't move forward with the arrest until we find the knife she used.
Is that reason that they want to win the case?
Yes.
Well, find it.
The family's close to the mayor, and I'm catching heat from the higher-ups.
I'm gonna ask you again.
Do you need any resources or personnel?
No, sir, I've got it.
Okay.
Dismissed!
Sergeant Jeffords, my office.
Gina: Uh-oh.
He probably wants to talk to you about how your shirts aren't tight enough probably.
Okay, how can we help? What do you need?
I need nothing.
I'm about to solve this case, meet the mayor, and sell my life rights to Channing Tatum so he can play my less attractive brother in the ensuing film.
Come on, Peralta, Holt said to use the whole team.
We all want this solved.
I appreciate the offer, but I work best alone...
Except when it comes to s*x.
Actually, sometimes including s*x.
Will you just let us help?
Okay, fine.
I will let one of you help me... Charles.
Yeah!
And I am choosing Charles because he's the least likely to steal my thunder.
I would never steal his thunder.
I-I'd be afraid to borrow it. [Chuckles]
Terry, I'd like you to accompany me to a gun range.
You mean drive you there and wait outside...
Far away from the guns.
I spent eight years in the public affairs office, so my tactical skills are a little rusty.
I need some pointers.
Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident.
The mannequin incident... I'm familiar.
[Screaming]
[Gun clicking]
Actually, there was an incident after that.
Another incident?
[Screaming]
You got to cool it, man.
I'm gonna get some candy.
Sir, I may not be the man for the job.
You used to be the precinct's champion marksman.
I only want to take pointers from the best.
So I'll keep it low-key.
We'll go after work to a private range.
No cops, no pressure.
Blam! Blam, blam!
Gun range.
I told Gina she could join us. I want to get certified.
There has been a ton of crime in my neighborhood, and the cops in my precinct are very bad.
You live in our precinct.
Yeah, I know.
Jake: I know we've gone over this before, but I have to ask you again.
Is there anywhere you can think of in that hallway where a knife could be hidden?
Well, since I've already told you, like, three times, no, why don't I just record it?
Then I don't have to say it again.
The hallway, like all other hallways, does not have a secret knife-hiding place.
All right, you want to hear it again?
Idea for a novel...
A mild-mannered doorman gets bitten on the pen1s by a radioactive spider and becomes the world's greatest lover.
No, don't stop it. I want to hear what happens.
This is terrific.
He saves the first lady, if you must know.
Sounds compelling.
Oh, boy.
Well, hello.
I heard you guys were making the rounds again.
All right. [Clears throat]
This one's all you, tiger.
Come on!
Police!
Hey, ma'am.
Thank God! Here, hold this.
[Baby crying]
The lasagna's burning. Okay.
Get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!
[Phone ringing] [Baby crying]
Oh. Okay. Peralta.
Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk.
Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.
The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back.
They aren't from a knife.
I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Don't shush me. I'm helping you.
No, no, I'm holding a baby.
That was actually very helpful, thank you.
Uh-oh. You better get back here. Now.
Oh! Hello, Peralta.
[Groans]
Jake: No, no, no!
I don't know why you're so upset, man.
I'm the one who had to come to this backwater stink hole.
What's up, little man?
What's up? Feeling sexy? Huh?
Yeah, I feel sexy.
Yeah, you look sexy, man. You know I do.
Watch out for that door.
Yo, how much you bench, seriously?
Captain, please, please, pretty please do not let him take over my case.
Major crimes is stepping in. Nothing I can do.
You're off the case.
I can't believe you're just rolling over and giving my murder away to The Vulture.
We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.
Yes, Boyle, I put that together from context.
First of all, major crimes has jurisdiction over any and all cases they want to take.
But more importantly, you're the one who insisted on working alone.
I told you for weeks to use the squad, and you refused.
I used them.
I mean, Rosa's the one who figured out the corkscrew.
And Charles caught a dog.
Oh, congratulations, Detective Boyle.
You should've involved him sooner.
Turn over your files to Detective Pembroke.
Sir, call him The Vulture.
Giving him a name makes him human.
Turn over the files.
Fine.
But in protest, I'm walking over there extremely slowly.
Thank you.
God! This is so boring!
For both of us.
You know, before I solve this case, I'd like to thank you for doing all the super-easy work, you know, the real Nancy Drew-level stuff.
Oh, yeah? Did Nancy Drew solve a lot of murders?
Yeah, she did... Murder on lce, Recipe for Murder.
Nancy was a wonderful Detective.
I wanted to be her when I grew up.
Thanks, Charles. That's helpful.
Hey! Should we take odds on how fast I'll solve this case?
Nope.
I mean, what was it with Diaz's last ""impossible"" extortion case?
What was it, six hours?
That's because it was 98% solved.
The last 2% is the hardest to get.
That's why they leave it in the milk.
What?



Pembroke: Oh! Wow!
Looking good, Santiago.
You foxy ma.
Go rot in hell.
This is your fault.
Thanks, champ. Good effort.
I got it from here.
And, hey, you feel free to call me anytime you need me to come down here and help powder that big white ass of yours.
[Grunts]
Well, that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
[Groans] I hate The Vulture so much!
Me too. But he's kind of hot.
What?
You can hate people and still think they're hot.
Case in point, Manuel Noriega.
You know what? I'm with you on this.
Tonya Harding.
Yeah, she's thick.
Right?
Always classy, Jake.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry you got vultured.
Happens to the best of us.
On my count.
One, two...
Three! I got it from here!
Yeah!
Get up! Get up! Turn around!
[Laughing]
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...
Can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Thanks, guys, I got it from here.
Let's go. Beat it!
Skim white chocolate macchiato for Charles.
I got it from here.
I used a gift card for that!
God, I just... I want to get back at him so bad!
I wish I could throw his cell phone in the toilet or slash his tires... I don't know.
Or slash his gorgeous throat.
I cannot figure you out.
Okay, I'm buying everyone drinks as long as we're here thinking of a revenge plan.
Best idea gets 50 bucks.
Throw 'em on out.
What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead?
Like, they died of cancer.
Charles, that is so dark.
I'm putting it down.
So my stance feels good, but I'm still not hitting center.
All right.
Back your left foot up a hair.
Gina: Like this?
Mm, mm, mm!
No! Gina! We've been over this.
Well, show me!
Like, wrap your thick, muscular arms around me and...
Terry: All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward.
Hold on, my nose itches.
Gina!
When I lock my shooting arm, the other hand feels unstable.
Now, what stance am I supposed to be doing...
Weaver or isosceles?
You guys did stances? Like, I'll be like...
Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina.
Listen, uh... Hey, all right, all right!
Look, hey, both you, just watch.
That's eight! He did it!
That was only seven.
Why are you counting my shots?
Are you trying to have me recertified?
Yes.
If you make eight of ten shots, I can sign off on you carrying a gun again.
Gina's here as an official witness, and I thought it'd be easier for you in a no-pressure environment.
I can't believe you tricked me!
You're too good a cop to be shackled to a desk.
You only have one hit until you get recertified.
So deep breath, huh?
Take the final shot.
Don't overthink it.
Just relax and breathe.
Bring air into your lungs...
Like you've done your whole life.
[Panting] Oh, my God.
Guys! How do you breathe?
I forgot how to breathe!
Is it two in, one out?
What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer?
Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.
Jake: All right. Here's what we're up to.
Steal his kidney, burn down his house, replace his aloe tissues with regular tissues.
Thank you, Charles. You're welcome.
Leave a dead cat in his cedar closet.
Note: He would have to own a cedar closet.
He seems like he would.
Sneak into his apartment and burn popcorn in the microwave.
Thank you, Charles.
Uh, Scully asked for mashed potatoes, so I wrote that down.
Well, I hate to say it, but I think, by default, Charles' motorcycle idea is the winner.
Yeah! Winning by default.
Jake: Let's get into it.
Anybody know where The Vulture lives?
On third, right near here. How do you know that?
Jake: Chug 'em, boys. We're rolling!
[Grunts]
Yes!
Take that, Vulture!
Yeah.
Nice.
All right, give me your hair dryer.
What? What are you talking about?
Don't you carry one in your purse?
Have you ever met a human woman?
There's a drugstore four blocks away... I'm on it.
Jake: Oh, no.
Scully traveling four blocks?
That could take weeks.
Hoo!
Take the shot, sergeant.
I just need a second.
You've had 18 minutes of seconds.
[Phone ringing]
Gina's authentic stolen police badges.
How can I help?
Jake: Hey, it's Peralta.
Oh, hey, Jake.
Hey, do you carry a hair dryer in your purse?
Of course. I'm not an animal.
Great.
I need you to bring it to The Vulture's apartment.
There's someone named ""The Vulture""?
Tell Rosa. She'd be into that.
Come on!
Peralta, why are you asking Gina about Detective Pembroke?
Oh, Captain, hello.
Uh, we are preparing him a gift basket of sorts.
Holt: Look, I understand that you're upset.
But if you want to keep this from happening again, I suggest that you pull your team together and solve these cases before major crimes can step in.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir. That is definitely clear.
Thank you, sir.
You should be frowning.
Why is Jake smi... Why are you smiling?
Because the Captain just gave us the perfect revenge plan.
We team up and solve this case right now!
That is not what he meant.
Think about it, Amy.
We go back to the scene of the crime, find the murder weapon, and out-vulture The Vulture!
No one gets in trouble if we crack the case.
Okay, screw it. I'm in.
Yes! That's right! All right.
We're angry. We're getting revenge.
We're a little bit tipsy.
We should not be driving. We're taking the bus.
I love the bus!
Jake: So the waitress heard the couple arguing at dinner.
Apparently he was having an affair, and it was not the first time.
Two years ago, she caught him with a dog walker who was walking his dog, if you know what I mean.
I do.
Right?
Yes, I got it.
s*x times.
Mm-hmm.
Anyways, we know it's the wife.
You're real talkative now that you want our help.
All right, it is possible that I should've brought you guys in sooner.
But I just get so excited, wrapped up in wanting to solve stuff, you know?
I get it. You want to be the best.
We all do.
You just don't have to be such a butthead about it.
What?
I just can't believe you would call me a butthead.
Shut up.
That's so harsh.
Hitchcock farts nonstop.
Still waiting, sergeant.
It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine.
It's just freaking me out.
Holt: You have a friend...
Who's just a silhouette?
Yes.
Let's all just count to a million.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
So then lceman says, ""You can be my wingman any day.""
And then Maverick says... I've seen the film, sergeant.
I haven't. What happens next?
Goose comes back, right? He's not really dead.
[Sighs]
Goose is gone.
No!
I know!
Jake: All right, here's how it went down.
9:45, a man screams.
90 seconds later, wife goes down to the doorman, says a guy murdered her husband and then ran off.
We know she's lying.
We've just got to find the corkscrew to make our case airtight.
I say we role-play, see if something sparks.
Darling, thank you for a lovely dinner.
Perhaps we should have one more drink before bed.
[High-pitched voice] Don't you ""darling"" me, you philanderer.
No, you're the husband. The husband had the affair.
I'm always the victim. I don't want to be the victim.
Okay, Charles is the door.
No. I'll be the victim. Don't make me a door again.
Great. Okay, so... Wife goes into the drawer.
Gets the corkscrew. Stab, stab, stab.
What did she do with the corkscrew?
She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.
No, we checked the trash, like, ten times.
We would've seen a bloody corkscrew.
All right, Hitchcock, you're up.
[Screaming]
The body.
The corkscrew's still in the body.
No, you're terrible at this. Go sit down.
You're up, Diaz.
Stab!
Then I...
Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car.
Security cam showed no one driving by at that time and nothing on the street.
Okay, I want in. But I only want to stab you.
Fine. Charles, door.
Right.
[Clears throat]
Okay, uh, sweetheart.
Time to die.
That seems a little harsh.
What if it was a magnetic corkscrew?
If the corkscrew was on a magnet...
It's stuck halfway down the inside of the trash chute.
I figured it out first! [Grunts]
Wow!
What's happening?
You have a ten-pound flashlight in your purse, but not a hair dryer?
I can't see far enough down.
Someone's gonna have to go down in there.
Someone with narrow shoulders.
No! I have broad shoulders.
I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders.
God!
See anything?
A little lower.
Freeze! Hands in the air!
Ahh!
We're cops. Broad shoulders!
Stuck! Told you... Broad shoulders.
Apparently, our Detective squad has gotten drunk, compromised the crime scene, and an officer has gotten stuck in a trash chute.
I need you to lead this squad, Terry.
And I mean really lead it.
I hope you take the shot.
Pembroke: What kind of precinct are you running here?
Would you like to sit down, Detective?
You seem upset. Hell yeah, I'm upset.
Your team disrupted a crime scene over which they have zero... Zero jurisdiction.
They were publicly drunk.
Apparently one of them pressed all the buttons on the elevator.
Only, maybe he just bumped up against the panel with that big white ass of his.
What now? Holt is gonna kill you.
I don't think he will...
Because...
Voila!
You actually found the corkscrew in the trash chute?
Stuck to the side, just like you said.
Boyle, we're pulling you out!
[Screaming]
This is the proudest moment of my career.
Ah!
Oh, my God, you guys, we out-vultured The Vulture!
[Imitates bird cawing]
What the hell was that?
What? It's a vulture.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take this corkscrew over to the D.A.
So we get the collar, not major crimes.
Peralta! Now.
[Sighs] Okay.
Before you get mad...
Shut it!
Holt was right.
I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids.
That's insulting.
I should've been on you guys more.
And starting now, I will be.
But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand.
You don't mean that.
Try me.
Okay.
Where you going?
The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault.
I can't let that happen.
Wait. Damn it.
Look, it's not your fault either.
And it's not The Vulture's fault.
It's Amy's.
I know. I know. It's mine.
It's mine, okay?
God, I do not love how this worked out.
Detective Pembroke.
Now what?
I'd like to cordially invite you to calm down, especially considering that this case has already been solved...
By you!
Looks like you found the murder weapon.
It's a good thing you realized it was magnetically stuck to the inside of the trash chute.
Congratulations.
[Chuckles]
Cracked the case all by yourself.
We done here?
Yeah. Yeah, we're done here.
Hey, keep up the bad work, champ.
Here it comes. [Grunts]
Why does he keep touching my butt?
Stay foxy.
Die lonely.
Well, case closed. Good work, everyone.
Let's, uh, call it a night without any further discussion.
Holt: No!
All of you broke into a crime scene under the influence of alcohol, overstepped your jurisdiction, and disobeyed my direct orders.
Everyone involved tonight is gonna get written up.
Okay, fine.
Here's everyone who was there.
Jake Peralta, J. Peralta, Dr. Jacob Peralta, who has a PhD in slow-jam studies from Funktown State University, also involved was the right honorable J... okay, enough.
My point is it was a Peralta special, sir.
No one else was there.
Well, Detective, I'm happy to see you're learning how to be part of a team.
Everybody go home. Sleep it off.
Sir? Thank you.
Ultimately, it was our raw sexual chemistry that helped him overcome his crippling fear.
You should just stay in the office all day every day and be my bestie.
You could join my dance troupe, Floorgasm.
We're looking for a man of precisely your...
It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game.
I know you will.
I mean, eventually...
Not tonight.
I need to go hug my baby girls.
Excuse me.
Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature.
Well, sometimes in life, you just have to take the high road.
[Timer rings] Oop! Time's up!
Can't wait to see it.
[Grunts] Ah, here we go.
[Grunts] That's good suction.
Oh!
Ooh! [Grunts]
Check it out!
Perfect, right?
Yeah!
""Dear Vulture, enjoy my big white ass. Jake.""
Here you are.
Always take the high road, Charles.
Always take the high road.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Amy: Whoa!
Settle.
Sorry, sarge.
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.
Everyone's drunk, wearing a mask, and carrying a fake gun.
Plus all the girls think they have to dress sexy.
I know, that is the worst. Please make them stop.
I passed a slutty tree on the way here.
Who wants to have s*x with a tree?
Was it a maple?
Was it a maple?
Buon giorno, buon giorno.
Pretty cool 'stume, huh?
'Stume?
Short for costume. Ah.
All right, let me guess. You are dumpy Chuck Norris.
No, I'm... Dumpy Ron Weasley.
No.
Terry: You guys, stop it.
He put thought into his costume, and he is obviously Miranda from s*x and the City.
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!
""Molto Mario""? Celebrity chef?
Ginger Prince of little ltaly?
Is he also a homeless troll doll?
'Cause you look like a homeless troll doll.
Hey, sweet Batali costume, dude.
Thank you!
There's a man with impeccable taste.
He bit a guy's butt off at a W.N.B.A. game.
Eric Stoltz from Mask.
I'll take it. Yeah.
I hope you're all well rested.
It's gonna be a busy night.
The holding cell's completely full.
I keep having to separate Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-Un.
Stop it! Stop making out!
Hey... no! What would Bill say?
Holt: We need two undercovers at the DeKalb street warehouse party.
Boyle, you're already in costume as, uh, Joy Behar?
I'm Mario Batali.
Okay. And, uh, Santiago, you go with him.
Yes, sir. Damn it.
Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.
Can you magically make everyone kind, sober, and fully dressed?
""Kind, sober, and fully dressed.""
Good news, everyone, we found the name of Santiago's s*x tape.
♪
Well, ring it up, nerds.
I just arrested my first Halloween idiot of the season.
He was trying to rob a bank but had a little trouble with the getaway.
Jake: Trying to ""split,"" huh?
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get out on ""a peel.""
I'm so glad you're stuck.
I've got a million of these.
No, no, don't touch the money! Ugh!
I swear, these perps are so stupid.
I'd make a better criminal than any of them.
Yeah, you would. You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit.
Thank you, Charles. And the best part is, none of you could catch me.
[All protesting]
I'm fairly certain you would be caught.
No, scratch that.
I'm 100% sure you'd be caught.
Ho, ho, ho!
All right, challenge accepted.
I didn't issue a challenge. Fine.
I'll issue it for you.
What's the most valuable thing in your office?
My medal of valor.
God, you are such a hero.
All right, how about this? I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office.
Why would I possibly agree to that?
Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.
And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.
But if I win... You won't.
You have to do all of my paperwork tonight, the busiest and spookiest night of the year.
And you have to publicly state that I'm an amazing Detective-slash-genius.
And this won't interfere with you doing your job?
You mean my job as an amazing Detective-slash-genius?
No, it will not. I'll do all of my work, guaranteed.
I'm considering it.
I'm interested.
I agree to participate. All right.
There's the robot I fell in love with.
Rosa: Hey.
Sister Steve here got mugged.
Some guy dressed as the royal baby punched him and took his wallet.
She keeps laughing at me.
Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school.
Ten.
I didn't know you went to catholic school.
Good. You shouldn't know it.
I get it. You're so mysterious and tough.
But you know what I think?
You're actually a big softy.
No, I think she's really mean.
You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.
Didn't graduate. Had to leave.
Why? What'd you do?
Here's a hint.
I'm not gonna tell you.
Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.
I'm a Detective.
I will detect!
Hey. [Sighs]
Got an arrest file here for the Captain.
Drunk and disorderly.
So, anyways...
Gina!
We never talk anymore.
How's the dance troupe? Did you get a haircut?
What's the Captain's schedule like today?
I'm not gonna help you rob him, Jake.
I'm his assistant, and I take that job incredibly seriously.
You're literally making paper airplanes out of police reports right now.
Well, how am I supposed to get it into that garbage can?
Jake: Please, Gina?
Fine, Captain's got a meeting downstairs in ten minutes.
You're the best. Mwah!
What does your skin taste like?
Dina Lohan. I'm wearing her face lotion.
That's it.
Thank you.
Okay, party's around the corner.
Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity.
Why is this costume so stiff?
And what is that smell?
The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit.
Hey!
I got you a chocolate.
Yet another great thing about Halloween... chocolate!
Thanks. Oh, look.
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka right from the bottle.
People think if they put on a costume, they can just get away with anything they want.
Halloween is Christmas for jerks.
Come on, ma'am. No open containers.
Oh, and why should I listen to you, bone person?
It's called skeleton. It's a very common word.
Just put the vodka away.
Raggedy Ann: You guys are cops?
These guys are cops!
[Partiers booing]
Are you in my ceiling, Peralta?
Jake: No.
So what's the plan?
You wait for me to leave my office, lower yourself down, take my medal, and win the bet?
Who are you talking to?
There's no one up here.
Peralta, just so you know, right now, I am taking my medal off the wall and placing it in a locked safe whose combination is known only to me.
The safe, in turn, is locked in the cabinet.
The only key to that cabinet is on my person.
I'm off to my meeting. Good luck with your plan.
You think that scares me?
I laugh in the face of adversity!
Are you still there?
Captain, are you still there? I can't hear...
Agh!
Ow.
Here you go.
Don't touch the butter.
What happened? I thought you guys were supposed to be at the warehouse party.
We got egged.
Some of the shell got in my contacts and my hair and my mouth and my bra.
I can't tell if that's hot or not.
Not hot.
Eggshell in my bra is not hot.
Well, it's kinda hot.
Boobs go in a bra. Up top.
Whoo! My man.
Well, it sounds like costume duty is going great.
So great. We're having the best time.
Right, Amy?
I wish I was dead. Hmm.
How's the unwinnable bet going?
Well, on the one hand, I fell through the ceiling and onto a pencil, but on the other hand, I also badly bruised my brain.
If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win.
Like who wears more denim jackets.
That was one time.
You guys never forget anything.
You know, frankly, I'm a little surprised you don't think I can win this thing.
You're always telling me how I'm the best.
You're the best, Jake.
Paperwork delivery.
You're the best, Jake.
Jake, you're the best.
Thank you, Charles.
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.
Terry: Look, Jake,
I love you like you're one of my daughters. Really?
But it's not about you or how smart you are.
It's about Captain Holt.
The man's a genius.
He's had your number at every turn.
Well, not this day... Turn... time.
Sorry, I'm pretty sure I had a concussion back there.



Here I come. All right.
Ohh, strong. Ahh.
Rosa: Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up.
Popular costume.
Any of these guys look familiar?
Maybe the third guy.
The baby who mugged me was pretty short.
[Snickers]
You're not supposed to laugh at me.
Number three, step forward and say, ""give me your money, you stupid bag of crap.""
Gimme your money, you stupid bag of crap.
No, wrong giant baby.
I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school.
Were you doing drugs?
Worse. Selling drugs?
Worse. How bad could it have been?
Did you burn down a church?
Number three, step forward and say the word ""worse.""
Worse.
Excuse me, Gina.
I can't find Peralta anywhere, and you're the only one who can decipher his handwriting.
He arrested that bunny, but I don't know what for.
He's either a crispy mother werewolf or cowboy mustard, oslo, Norway.
Hmm.
The bunny groped multiple women on the subway.
Being able to read Jake's writing is a gift.
A useless, useless gift.
Holt: Excuse me one second.
Nice costume, Peralta.
No Peralta here.
Just a normal janitor pushing trash around.
Come out of there.
[Sighs]
Captain, hey.
You really thought this was gonna work?
Uh, it did work.
This whole janitor gambit was designed to fail.
It's just like in chess.
Sometimes in order to win, you have to sacrifice your king.
That's exactly how you lose in chess.
Have you ever played the game?
Yeah, I used to play with my uncle Bob all the time, and he said I was great.
This is a game of concentration, Jake.
So focus your mind, and start shooting.
Now you're a master of chess, huh?
He taught me how to shoot backgammon too.
I expected better of you.
You could have at least created a diversion to distract me from your terrible costume.
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.
I had a diversion planned.
There was just a slight timing issue.
Oh, my God!
Get down, everyone! There's a big fire!
Captain, you better head over there for, like, 15 minutes and see what's going on with that.
Beware of the back draft. I'll be in your office.
You have beautiful eyes.
Have it your way.
But you're gonna need this.
And... that.
It's filthy in there.
Come on, Amy! Loosen up!
You look like such a cop!
Come on, have some fun, you know?
It'll help you blend in!
Whoo!
Stop trying to get me to love Halloween.
It'll never work.
I'm backing it up.
Oh, God, please don't.
Hey, heads up.
I'll cut 'em off at the exit. Okay.
Move! Move, move!
He ditched the drugs. I'm on it.
Ugh.
[Groans]
Oof, everything is sticking to me.
Ooh.
Ay, h. Yes.
Male partier: Hey, watch out, man.
Ugh! What is that?
How is it hot and cold?
So the soonest you can fix the ceiling is Monday?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Wait, stop scratching me.
We're supposed to be a team.
Ahem.
Captain, hi.
I was just photocopying some stuff.
Are you trying to jam pigeons into my air-conditioning vent to flush me out of my office?
Way to ruin the surprise.
How did you get those birds? By using my big, fat brain.
Get in the bag, you damn bird.
Eat the bread. Eat the bread!
I gotcha! I gotcha!
All part of my elaborate plan to defeat you.
So far, you and your big, fat brain are losing... badly.
Maybe, if we're talking about who's winning our bet.
But if we're talking about who's holding more birds, I'm winning, four-nothing.
You're only holding two.
Yeah. [Clears throat]
Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff.
Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five.
[Deep voice] He high-fived me too.
Wait... Hitchcock?
Darn it.
I wasn't supposed to talk, but I got so excited about that astronaut.
What is happening?
Amy paid me 50 bucks to trade places with her for the rest of the night.
Really? Yeah.
I'm gonna use that money to buy two suits.
Well, I was gonna ask you to tell the Captain that I brought in royal babies for Diaz, but I'm sure he already knows, since he's always one step ahead of me.
Aww.
Gina: Why so down, little clown?
Jake: I'm just sick of losing to Holt.
I want that medal.
It's not real gold.
I tried selling it online. Zero bids.
But here's some advice I gave to the girls in my dance troupe at the ""dance till you drop"" tournament.
That advice was, dance. Dance!
Dance.
Yeah, I'm not really sure that applies here, Gina.
It does apply. It means don't give up.
We would've won if Natasha's water hadn't broken.
Oh, Natasha had her baby? You know Natasha?
Yeah. Yeah.
Both: Her dog has lupus.
Yeah. That's a trip.
Small world. Yes.
All right, I'm gonna go cry.
I kind of feel bad for him.
Don't.
He brought this on himself.
You can hang up now.
You paid money to get out of working with me?
Charles, I had to. Tonight has been awful.
Halloween is the worst, and I don't understand why you like it.
No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great.
The big kids egg you.
Then you and your friends run away together.
Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity.
That's all I wanted for us.
You can keep the wig. I don't need it anymore.
I don't really need it either.
Jake: Hey, Captain Holt, can you come out here for one sec?
[Sighs]
You need something, Peralta? Yes, I do.
Hit it, royal babies.
What... no!
Give me my keys.
Will you stop catching me?
Do you have any idea how much I spent on key chains?
$23.
Wow, that is unbelievably close.
22.76.
Keys. Okay, look.
Tonight has been a little humiliating.
Things are not going well, so I'm gonna just throw this out there.
What do you say we call off the bet and pretend this whole thing never happened?
Oh, I'm not letting you off the hook.
What? No. Pfft.
I meant to give you an out, so you could save face.
This is getting sad.
Yeah, for you.
[Clears throat] So.
I called your school.
And I managed to get a hold of one sister Bernadette.
I remember that old bag. She was my favorite.
Well, guess what she said.
Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition.
Fine.
The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the american ballet academy.
I was a classical dancer.
And I was good.
I knew it!
I knew you were a big softy.
You tell anyone, I break your face.
No, you won't. You're too sensitive.
[Chuckling]
Captain, sorry to interrupt.
Some officers just arrested Peralta.
What? They caught him scaling the side of the building with a blowtorch.
[Sighs]
Captain.
Welcome to the endgame.
Would you care to shake the hand of the man who defeated you?
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs. Ohh, that hurt.
Whoo!
Climbing the side of the building with a blowtorch.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking I had better core strength.
I got winded, like, ten feet up.
I knew you wouldn't win the bet, but your performance tonight has made me question not only how good a Detective you are, but, quite frankly, how smart you are.
Well, that's not surprising. You constantly underestimate me.
No, you've been correctly estimated.
You have five minutes until your deadline, and here you are, handcuffed to a table, in a locked room.
Which is precisely where I planned on being.
Captain, let me tell you a little story.
You remember when I fell through your ceiling?
Yes, that was six hours ago.
It was, I admit, a disastrous failure.
But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met.
With Herman, I commenced the perfect crime.
I caught you as Herman.
But you didn't catch Rosa.
Come out of there.
Jake: It turns out that Rosa is great at picking locks.
Does not surprise me. No, me neither.
Of course, I had to find a way to get her out of your office without you seeing her.
Jake: So I created a diversion.
Not mistimed... Perfectly timed so she could escape unseen.
What about the pigeons?
Oh, the gray pigeons?
Jake: They were a red herring. Thank you.
Their only purpose was to draw you into the copy room while two members of my team broke into your locked office.
So now I had a way into your office and an open cabinet.
All that was left was for the royal babies to steal your keys.
Yes, but you didn't need the keys.
The cabinet was already unlocked.
You needed a way into the safe.
And I got it.
Jake: You were so concerned with getting your keys back, you didn't even notice the sergeant steal your phone.
That's right, even the sergeant is on my side.
I then had Charles dust your screen cover for prints.
The greasiest smudges revealed the four numbers you use the most...
The four numbers in your passcode.
Based on your advanced age, I assumed that you use the same passcode for everything...
Your phone, your email, and, of course, your safe.
That would be a fair assumption.
It was at that point that I bumped into a girl dressed as a sexy robot, and we got our flirt on... hard.
'Sup?
'Sup? Jake Peralta.
And how was flirting part of the plan?
Oh, it wasn't. It just ruled.
And that brings us to five minutes ago, when Amy came to your office and told you that I had been arrested.
I knew she's the only one you would believe because, frankly, she's usually too lame to take part in these kinds of things.
Jake: And as you walked over here, Charles awkwardly stuffed himself through your window and opened your safe.
We had the four numbers of your code, which meant there were 24 possible combinations for Charles to try.
That could take up to four minutes, which is why I really dragged out this explanation.
I mean, really stretched it. I don't know if you noticed, but there were times where I was like, what am I even talking about? This isn't...
Oh.
But now, four minutes is up.
Which means Boyle is either on the other side of that door holding your medal, or I've lost.
Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima...
20 seconds to spare. Game over, Captain.
Check me.
I think you mean ""checkmate.""
You really need to learn how to play chess.
How did you get everyone to help you?
I appealed to their sense of teamwork and camraderie with a rousing speech that would put Shakespeare to shame.
[Scottish accent] For too long, we've been put down, ridiculed, made to wear ties!
But no more!
For today, we defeat him!
And that worked? No. No, no. Not at all.
Jake: My speech did not inspire them.
Come on. So I bribed them.
I told them that if we pulled this off, I would do all of their paperwork.
And since you're doing all my paperwork...
I'm impressed, Peralta.
Well done.
Thank you, sir.
In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly... Captain?
What provided our success. Sir?
He's not coming back.
Terry: Boyle, I need you in the briefing room.
What is all this?
You know how I think Halloween is for jerks?
Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk.
I'm sorry about tonight.
""I'm sorry about tonight.""
We found the title for Santiago's follow-up s*x tape.
I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.
It's not your fault. I was terrible.
""It's not your fault I was terrible"" is also one of your s*x tapes.
Ow.
Halloween is unbearable.
But it was slightly less unbearable with you.
Don't. Okay.
Anyway.
We're all going to the bar, so get changed, 'cause you can't be the only one there not wearing a 'stume.
'Stume! Oh, my God. It caught on.
All: No.
Ah, Captain Holt. It is so nice to see you.
Never thought I'd say that. Hmm.
A poor winner. I never would've guessed.
Yeah, you would've.
Way to go all out on your costume, by the way.
I believe you have an announcement to make, so the floor is yours.
[Sighs] Attention, everyone.
Jake Peralta is an amazing Detective-slash-genius.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some paperwork to do.
All right.
Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger.
He had 19 wallets in his diaper.
Officer: We got a runner!
Waahhh!
Damn!
Oh, I didn't tell you.
I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas.
It's a good thing we gave 'em a heads up.
Team effort, Go 99.

[Knocks] Hey, Cap'n, got a second?
It's ""Captain.""
What did I say?
""Cap'n,"" like Cap'n Crunch.
All right, but to be fair, Cap'n Crunch was a war hero and the primary male role model in my house, growing up, so...
Anyways, cap-tain, you know that jewelry store robbery down by grand army Plaza?
Mm-hmm.
I know who did it... Dustin Whitman.
I put him in Rikers two years ago.
He just got out, and the crime scene matches his M.O. perfectly.
[Siren wails]
Jake: Okay, what do we got?
Well, security cam shows a male suspect, 5'9""...
Wearing a black ski mask.
He bypassed the McConnell alarm by using the magnetic kill switch.
And he only stole diamonds, nothing over two carats.
Yeah, exactly. How'd you know?
I'm a Detective. It's what I do.
I'm just kidding. I need a lot more information.
But that would've been a great exit line, right?
The crime techs aren't done yet, but I'm 100% sure it's Whitman.
Well, let's see what kind of physical evidence they turn up, and then we can talk arrest.
Actually, hilarious story.
Jake: So that is Dustin Whitman.
You already arrested him? With insufficient evidence?
By law, we have 48 hours to find that evidence, or we have to let him go.
You just started the clock.
What's up with this emergency meeting?
Whoa, Detective Santiago.
Big date tonight. How do I look?
Well, I think you look...
[Donkey braying]
Sorry, that was supposed to be a catcall.
I don't know how this works.
Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?
I just wanted to know how she got such smoky eyes.
Turns out it was an STD rash.
Detective Peralta has made a collar in the jewelry store heist.
Way to go, Jakey.
Ah, that's okay.
No. He didn't get sufficient evidence to make it stick, so we have the next 48 hours to fix his mistake.
[All groaning] Damn it, Jake.
What evidence did you have when you arrested this guy?
Some pretty ironclad stuff.
Dustin, it's been a while.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
Well, well, well, if it isn't joke Peralta.
[Laughs]
That's it, you're under arrest.
Case closed?
If we don't find something conclusive, it jeopardizes the case and opens the department up to a lawsuit.
So cancel your plans.
We're here until this is over.
Damn it, Peralta.
Ow!
I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.
But?
That was it.
I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.
♪
Terry, you just pulled two doubles.
You must be tired.
I'll stay for this Whitman debacle.
You go home.
I'm not tired.
Why would you think I was tired?
[Grunting]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone.
Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying.
Rosa: Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner?
They make the best pies in New York City.
Oopsie, you said something super dumb.
The best pie in the city's at Crust.
Wrong. Ignorant and wrong.
Uh, you think you can just bully people, but you can't. It's not okay.
I'm the bully around here, ask anyone.
Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website.
Which pie's better?
Yeah, whose do you like better, mine or Rosa's?
Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet.
Why is your eye twitching?
[Scoffs] Wouldn't you like to know?
Could I see you for a second in the evidence lockup?
Charles, I know what's going on.
You've tried both pies.
You know mine is better.
But you're scared to tell Rosa, 'cause you're into her.
What?
[Laughs nervously] That is not true, okay?
I-I-I don't even like food.
What?
Who's Rosa?
Y-you're the scared one.
[Door shuts]
Planning your strategy?
No, I'm just making funny faces at him.
This mirrored glass is awesome.
It straight-up works.
An effective use of your limited time.
It is, actually. That's how I got him last time.
Let him stew for a little bit, got in his head, and he confessed.
You better be right.
I am.
Hey, make some funny faces while I'm in there.
I wanna see if I can tell.
I didn't do anything, joke.
[Mouthing]
That's funny.
You said the exact same thing last time.
And how'd that work out for you?
Let's take a look.
Okay. Here's you at your trial.
You in prison.
Me meeting Regis Philbin.
That was fun.
You still in prison.
Me at Splash Mountain, just pepper these in here.
You in prison, you in prison, you in prison, you get it.
You got the wrong guy.
All right.
Not ready to confess?
Fine by me.
I got all the time in the world.
No, you actually have 48 hours.
I know the law.
Nuh-uh.
So looks like we're gonna be here for a while.
Should someone do a coffee run?
You know what? Coffee's on me.
Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos or anything, I've only got, like, 10 bucks.
Okay.
Rise and shine, detectives, rise and shine.
Peralta, I want you to bring everyone up to speed.
You slept in your office, and you look exactly the same. How?
What are you talking about? My hair is a mess.
Oh, yeah. Briefing room, five minutes.
How long were we asleep?
Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout.
So, like, three hours.
Morning.
Jake: Ugh.
I can't believe you live nearby and you won't let anyone crash at your place.
You people already know too much about me.
I know exactly three facts about you, and one of them is that you won't let any of us crash at your place.
Is that a nightgown?
Terry: That's mine.
It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.
""If at first you don't secede, try try again.""
Terry: When you're that big, you buy anything that fits.
A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.
Jake: Okay, a couple of quick announcements.
First, I met our night janitor Ronald.
If any of you are missing hand sanitizer, he drank it.
Second, our warrants finally went through.
We gotta place Whitman at the scene and prove that he either possessed or sold those diamonds.
I know you're all tired, but don't forget why we're here.
Because we're dedicated detectives.
Because Peralta jumped the gun.
Yep.
Get to work.
So we both had good answers.
This isn't a joke. You're ruining our weekend.
Okay, I'm sorry you had to cancel dinner with your dad.
Date. I had a date.
Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it.
Thank you. Everyone listen to Rosa.
No, I'm still furious at you.
Okay, no one listen to Rosa.
She's clearly an accomplice to this crime.
I'm gonna go take another crack at Whitman.
You've been in there, like, five times.
What are you gonna do?
Annoy him into talking?
Ha, ha.
Two, three, four.
[Strumming guitar out of tune]
Aah!
[Shrieking]
Didn't work.
Thank you. Did not work.



Hey, Captain.
Will you please let everyone else go?
I feel bad that I ruined their weekend, and I can tell they're pissed at me.
I mean, Charles hasn't tried to high-five me all morning.
Yes, I've taken the brunt of that.
Kitchen buds.
Are you sure Whitman did it?
Yes, I'm positive.
Then the whole team stays.
We have a better shot with everyone on it.
Fine, will you at least tell Hitchcock to go home?
His mouth smells like rotten trout milk.
Is there such a thing?
I'm just telling you what it smells like.
Get out.
Do you have the bank records?
Mm-hmm.
Good thing I didn't reschedule my date for tonight.
We're never leaving here.
Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know?
Saved you from another lame internet date with some lame guy named Dirk or Mar... garine.
He's not lame, okay?
He works with a friend of mine.
He has a human name.
And I'm not telling you what it is, because you'll look him up and make fun of him.
I can't believe you think so little of me that you would just automatically assume...
Is it Luke Mueller?
How did you do that?
Well, you only have one friend... Kylie.
And she has seven male coworkers.
Goatee, goatee, jaunty fedora, profile pic is a sunset, Tasmanian devil tattoo, goatee.
Leaving Luke as the only viable option.
Well, he's nice, and he uses proper punctuation in texts.
Dreamboat.
And I wanted to go out with him.
All right. You know what? Reschedule for tonight.
I promise I will get us out of here in time.
Fine. I'm holding you to that.
Where's he taking you?
Terrific, let's get everyone involved.
Dinner and a movie.
[Farting noise]
Dinner and a movie is the perfect first date.
I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together.
And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo!
Kissing.
For me: Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down.
So pretty much the same as what I said.
None of the partials match Whitman.
If he did it, he didn't leave any prints.
Maybe he doesn't have any.
Interesting fact about me...
I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.
Hi, hello.
What are you doing?
Holt said you didn't have to come in here.
You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.
Because I'm so nice, I brought two pies.
One is from Crust.
And one's also from Flatbush Diner.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
Charles could try them and tell us which one is better.
How fun is that?
So fun.
Yay!
Yum, yum, yum. Yummy.
You got a second, Captain?
I've got these overtime forms for you to s...
Are you stifling a yawn?
No, sir.
Go home, sergeant.
I'm fine.
And I filled this out. I just need you to...
Permission to yawn, sir.
Go home.
Please, I'm begging you.
[Sniffs] Oh, fair enough.
Yeah.
[Chuckckle] That's for women.
These your glasses?
Mm-hmm.
They're gigantic.
My contacts dried out, thanks to you.
And they're cool. No, they're not.
Wow, you are blind blind.
Yeah.
You're a blind cop.
How has there not been a made-for-TV movie about your struggles? Give those back.
Yeah, okay.
Wait a minute.
I did it.
I got Whitman, dead to rights.
I can still make my date? As I promised.
Go get changed.
And by that, of course I mean throw your glasses in the garbage, then get laser surgery, then recuperate... And she left the room.
It's all right. 6 out of 12.
Out of 12? Why?
For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound...
Sound? Come on, Charles.
Try her nasty pie.
Oh, wow.
That's the best pie I ever had.
[Laughs] No, no.
No, no, no.
What's this?
We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.
I didn't ask what you were doing.
I asked what you are doing.
Pie taste test, it's over. I won.
That's unacceptable.
If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place.
Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places.
We gonna be here awhile.
Debit card statement.
You were at a parking meter two blocks from the jewelry store an hour before the robbery.
Oh, no, you found out... About my wife.
We both have cards, because we share a joint account, because we love each other.
You're incapable of love, and I'll prove it!
Oh, I'm very tired.
I want my lawyer, now.
Ugh!
You have changed.
You used to go straight to prison!
Did Whitman talk?
Oh, he talked all right.
He asked for his lawyer.
By using words, which is technically talking.
We can't ask him any more questions till we find his lawyer, and we can't find his lawyer anywhere.
I'm sorry.
Aah, come on.
Why is there pie here?
Jake: That's not good.
I think the world of you, as a colleague and friend.
Shut up, Peralta.
Jake: Yep.
Yes!
Another one for Crust.
It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.
Ah, come on!
You went home and showered?
That's so unfair.
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here. Oh, cool.
Hey, can I borrow it?
Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?
What possible answer could he give that would make you say yes?
I wanna brush my teeth.
Jake, it's been in my mouth.
That's the grossest thing I've ever heard.
That's the grossest thing you've ever heard?
You caught a guy on the subway with a bag of human ears.
Your thing's grosser.
Bring out the meringues.
I brought a few more. That's so many.
You wanted something, sir?
Look, it's impossible to make you leave.
But you do have to sleep, and that's an order.
Sir, this is not necessary.
Also, can't sleep without my whale songs.
Terry, I've seen this before.
Problems at home, so you stay late at the job, but that only makes it worse.
Everything's great with my wife.
It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along.
He thinks I'm a weakling.
You?
Let me get that for you.
I can do it.
Tiny Terry loves his pickles.
He makes me feel so small.
Who cares what he thinks?
You're a police sergeant. You're a grown man.
Now take your nap.
And if I see the lights on in here, I'm gonna be very disappointed in you.
Are you the idiot that made a Friday night arrest?
I was in the poconos with my wife.
You ruined my entire weekend.
Get in line, because that's their attitude.
Get your own attitude.
He has an alibi, geniuses. He was at Torque.
It's a nightclub in Cape May, New Jersey, all night.
Nice try.
You think I'm gonna waste six hours driving to the Jersey Shore and back on some fake alibi?
It's up to you.
But in ten hours, he walks.
More like in ten hours, he walks into prison, when we bust him.
Let's follow up on his alibi.
Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road.
No.
You should've looked into this before you made the arrest. You go.
Scully: Oh, Captain, I'm happy to go.
I love the saltwater taffy down there.
Scully loves the saltwater taffy down there.
No, Peralta's going. Go, Peralta.
Look, I know I caused this problem, but I can fix it.
We just got some new security footage in.
Let me stay here and go through it.
I'm gonna prove that Whitman was at the scene of the crime, even if it kills me.
This is killing me.
Good. Die.
[Sighs]
You know, if it does come to that, I have but one wish before I go.
Can I please put your glasses on my pen1s?
I just think that would be really funny.
Hey, can you make copies of these warrant requests for me?
I'm not your secretary.
You're everyone's secretary.
That's literally your job.
And your job is lying about your taste buds?
[Sighs]
I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing.
You're right.
The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.
Thank you.
It's just...
I want Rosa to like me.
All right, do whatever you want, but most women don't really like it when dudes lie to them.
Except for me, but I'm wired to thrive on dysfunction.
Nothing.
Wait, wait, wait. This guy... 5'9 "" or 5'10"", black knit cap.
Come on, come on, come on.
Jake: Gotcha!
Ugh, it's not him.
Let's just arrest this guy. Who even cares anymore?
So how'd my new best friend Luke take it when you cancelled on him again?
Don't know, hasn't called me back.
Which is what always happens, because it's impossible to be a cop and date.
Amy, look. There is a guy out there with incredibly low standards and a super weird soul patch, and he is waiting for you.
Amy, my patch tingles for you.
We will wed on the isle of New Jersey.
Our first dance will be to Jessie's girl, because my name is definitely Jessie.
It's so romantic.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Yeah, there's good news, and there's bad news.
The bad news is my saltwater taffy place was closed.
And the good news?
Whitman's alibi checked out.
Security footage from Torque shows he was there.
That's not good news.
That's bad news.
Right. That is bad news.
Sorry, it's on me.
No, Detective Scully, it's on Peralta.
No, Captain, that's on Santiago.
It's on me. It's still on me.
Terry: This is such a disaster.
It's not good. D.A.'s furious.
Whitman and his lawyer are in my office right now, gunning for a lawsuit. No, not that.
My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK.
But also the botched investigation, that's bad too.
Okay, what can I do?
Oh, your services will not be necessary, because you need to go home and change for your date.
What?
I called handsome Luke.
I explained the weekend was entirely my fault, partially.
And he wants to go out with you tonight.
Thanks, Peralta.
You're welcome.
Just promise me you won't use the condoms in the secret pocket of your purse, okay?
They're expired.
How do you know what's in my purse?
I needed concealer for a zit.
Plus, you know, we spend so much time together here, I know everything about everyone.
I know Hitchcock went bald at 15.
Scully used to date Hitchcock's wife.
Charles has a bike with a little basket on the front.
How else would you carry baguettes?
And Rosa has a shower in her apartment, I think.
I got nothing on her.
Good.
Well, I guess we did just spend 48 hours locked in here together.
Holy crap.
What?
Locked in here together.
So we will be filing a wrongful arrest suit against the NYPD.
And when I win, I'm gonna buy club Torque, put a statue of Jake Peralta right in the middle of the dance floor.
First off, that's a terrible threat.
I would love to have a statue of myself in the middle of a dance club.
Second... [Clears throat]
Do me a favor, take a look at this picture, and tell me what you see.
You and Regis Philbin.
Jake: Awesome, right?
Surprisingly down-to-earth guy and definitely not the picture I meant to show you.
But take a look at this.
That's right, it's you and your old cell mate Marcus Cole.
And here he is again outside the jewelry store.
The two of you planned this together in prison.
You taught him your M.O, he pulled off the robbery, you got yourself an alibi, and you split the loot.
Oh, man, I can't believe he caught us.
[As Regis Philbin] Of course he did, Peralta is the best!
Aw, thanks, Reg. That's enough.
Yeah, I gotta work on my Regis.
Anyway, see ya in jail, Whitman.
You got anything else to say?
Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible.
It's inedible.
Food is supposed to be edible.
So you were lying?
What the hell, Boyle?
[Giggles]
Put it in the suck-it bucket.
Crust isn't any better.
It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles.
Desserts don't need to be clever.
They just need to be good.
This is the best pie in New York City...
Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910.
Recipe unchanged. Taste it.
Damn, it is amazing.
This pie is so good, I hate it.
You just graduated pie school, bitches.
Sorry I said ""bitches,"" I'm just really worked up.
Yow! Mmm, what is that?
Sorry for screwing up everyone's weekend.
Hey, uh, drinks on me. Who's in?
Oh, no way. No, I got the date. I gotta change.
Come on.
Everyone's tired, Peralta.
They just wanna go home.
Yeah, but I have to prove I'm not selfish, so I don't care what they want.
That sounded bad.
And to make up for what I did, I'll cover one shift each for all of you.
[Laughs] No kidding?
Except Santiago.
What?
Jake: I got you your date back.
One nice thing from me is all you get.
So this is my desk.
Desk jockey, huh?
You just sit here, eat your pickles, wait for the criminals to turn themselves in.
Actually, I don't like pickles that much.
Holt: Terry, I'm glad I found you.
There's been a development in the Russian mob case.
Oh? Yeah, our killer has been spotted in the warehouse down by the canal. Get your gear.
So you want me first through the door, sir?
Oh, it's just you.
The SWAT team is on another call, so you'll have to do it alone.
Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.
Hey, no, do your thing, do your thing.
Go, Terry.
You can crash on my couch.
I even downloaded you some whale songs.
Thank you, sir. I'll never forget it.
Good night, Terry.

Careful!
You only get one shot at this, Peralta.
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
I saw the first 15 minutes of The Hurt Locker.
Hurry! The stench is too much.
We gotta get those shoes outta here.
How much time do we have?
Scully ate his pot pie 30 minutes ago, so we probably got 10 minutes left on this nap.
12 if he's turkey tired.
All right, come to papa.
[Groans] It's trapped. Abort mission.
I have an idea...
[Suspenseful music]
♪
Let's send these shoes to hell.
Oh, wait. [Coughs]
Yeah, just smells worse than before.
Oh... Ugh! Abort!
♪
Whoa! Why are you here before me?
Am I asleep? Is this a dream?
I am early because Jimmy Brogan is here today.
Why do you care so much about some old reporter?
Some old reporter?
Is the sky just some big blue hat that the world wears?
No. And no one has ever thought that.
My point exactly.
Jimmy Brogan wrote The Squad about badass New York cops in the '70s.
It's the best book I've ever read, and I've read 15 books.
50 books is not a lot. Wait...
You said 15?
The Squad is what made me decide to become a Detective.
And it was my first book report.
""The detectives wiped the mobsters' blood off their boots and found the scag.""
Scag is heroin, and the book says it's so good, you can never stop doing it!
See me after class, Jacob.
Fun side note... I late lost my virginity to Mrs. Stratton's daughter.
It was... very fast.
Nice.
Mr. Brogan, these are detectives Santiago and Peralta.
Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan of your book.
Would you mind signing my copy?
I'd love to. It's always nice to meet a fan.
You can just make it out to ""death wish.""
That's what everyone calls me, 'cause I'm always first through the door.
You go through doors normally, and everyone calls you pineapples.
My grandma calls me pineapples, and I regret telling you that.
Those New York cops from the '70s you wrote about were my idols... I mean, Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg.
Those guys were the real deal.
I once saw Gaminsky choke a hippy to death with his own ponytail.
Illegal. Love that.
Mr. Brogan is writing an article about how Brooklyn detectives have changed in the 35 years since The Squad.
He'll be observing the two of you on your lnternet identity theft case.
I hope Mr. Brogan's presence doesn't prove to be a distraction to you, Peralta.
Distracted? Me? No, sir.
Evil would love that.
But I'm not giving evil the satisfaction.
Not today.
Where's the can? I gotta unload.
""Unload."" Great choice of words.
It'd be an honor to show you, sir.
All right. Everyone's here.
Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.
Pass. This seminar is not optional, Diaz. You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow.
The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand.
Why? I'm fine on the stand.
Look, I'll make this real simple so even these dum-dums can understand.
Man did crime.
I'm sorry... can you make her stop doing that weird thing with her face?
Crying?
And when this is over, I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna break those little fingers.
[Taps gavel] Ms. Diaz.
Please stop threatening the stenographer!
This is an important case. You need to do well.
Fine. I'll take your dumbass seminar.
That's the spirit!
Someone has placed tiny scanners inside ATMs to steal card numbers and pins which they sell on the lnternet.
Oh, good God, why do you smell like an ashtray?
Oh, sorry, mom.
It's the only way I can cope with the stress of the job.
[Groaning]
Pffft!
Anyway... We're running an algorithm to comb through the transactions looking for a pattern which will lead us to the perp's IP address. Got it.
""Boring mumbo jumbo.""
Well, you could think of the algorithm as a boot and the IP address as some poor slob's skull.
[Smack] You know?
We used to call guys who bragged about sitting around all day hair bags.
[Chuckling]
Except for Detective Finaldi.
No, he had to sit around all day.
A mafia thug pried both his kneecaps off with a crowbar.
[Whispers] Gah... so lucky.
This kind of data-driven police work has reduced crime by over 70%.
I know hair bag work when I see it.
Do me a favor... wake me when your shift is over.
No way.
That is amazing!
All you need is for a jury to like you.
If they like you, they'll trust you. Fine.
How do I get these morons to like me?
Don't call them morons.
Good instinct! Okay.
Sit up straight, all right? Be aware of your hands, okay?
And don't be afraid to smile.
And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, ""to be perfectly candid...""
To be perfectly candid...
I like that.
Terry: And always make good eye contact.
But don't stare at people. Yeah.
You gotta blink. But don't blink too much.
Or too fast. I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.
Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.
I know how to blink.
Quick question, sir.
You know how we've been trading favors back and forth and it's your turn to give me one?
None of that is true. Yeah, I know.
Please, can I jump onto a sweet mob-related homicide?
There are no sweet mob-related homicides on which to jump.
Boom! There's one at the seven-three.
Maybe I should roll over there, help out.
Brogan can tag along, maybe write some stuff down.
Why do you idolize that man and the time he wrote about?
Because the '70s were amazing.
I mean, everyone had thick, juicy moustaches and all the clothes were orange and flammable.
The '70s were not a good time for the city or for the department...
Corruption, brutality, sexism.
Diaz and Santiago never would have made Detective, and an openly gay man like me...
I never would have been given a command.
There were very few black detectives.
Did I ever tell you what my first day on the job was like?
[Background chatter]
Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.
Are you... here to turn yourself in?
Ah, yeah, that's really messed up.
But the guys that Brogan wrote about...
They were great detectives. I mean, they were legit.
Some of them were legit.
Some of them were just Brogan's drinking buddies.
Sir, that is a brilliant idea.
It wasn't an idea. It was a scathing indictment of your personal hero.
Eh, six of one.
This is the best!
Drinking with Jimmy Brogan.
So tell me more about Quigg.
Could he really light a matchstick on his face?
One time during a drug bust, he had one of his fingers shot off.
He didn't even flinch. He just picked it up and used it to flip off every puerto rican in the place.
And that's my cue. It's late.
Are you kidding?
The old guard drank till dawn, ate some coffee grounds, then started the whole day all over again.
Pfft! I eat coffee grounds.
Sure you do, pineapples.
How about another round?
Are you kidding me?
I wanna hang with you till one of us dies.
Look, I'm tired of talking.
Why don't you tell me some of your stories?
Great. 'Cause I got some stories that'll make Training Day look like Super Troopers.
Eh, it's not... bartender.
Two scotches.
No, no, he meant two bottles. What?
I mean... yeah!
Aaaalll... right!
[Laughs]
Perp: You'll never get me!
You'll never get me!
We already got you, idiot.
Look who's here.
How was your night of old-school drinking, hmm?
Pretty hung over? Shh!
Turn off your mouth siren.
Here are the texts I got from you last night.
""Best night ever.""
""Why scotch burn so good?""
""Whaz his name in Serpico?""
""Who's the friend of yours with the ping-pong?""
And lastly, a picture of you on the subway platform eating Chinese chicken salad with no shirt on.
[Laughs] Well, last night was awesome.
We had an epic night of bonding that I will never forget.
[Slurring] Do it! I believe in you.
Throw it! I believe in you.
Man, I wonder if Brogan's okay.
He's 65 and drank two bottles of scotch.
He might be dead. He looks fine to me.



Morning, kid!
Ooh! How ya doing?
Uh... hey...
So good. I feel great.
And I definitely don't think it's burning hot in here.
Well, I'm around.
Grab me if anything develops in your case.
[Laughs/wheezes] You got it.
That hurt so bad. Let me know when he's gone so I can slide onto the nice, cool floor.
He's gone. Great.
Mmm...
Oh... my whole body has dry mouth.
Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?
It's the perfect place for our second lesson...
Courthouse wardrobe.
What's wrong with the way I dress?
You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain.
Not me.
I think you look like a sexy motorcycle.
Boyle, pull it together.
Yeah.
We need to soften up your look.
My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.
Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?
I look like arsenio.
So it's... perfect?
That's actually my wedding suit.
No.
Yes.
No. No.
That's great. Perfect!
You look beautiful... ly...
Appropriate for court.
♪ A new sensation ♪
[groaning] Ohh...
Scully.
Hey, Jake. You've been alive forever.
How'd you used to cure hangovers?
Oh, I didn't drink. I was, however, extremely into cocaine for most of 1986.
I gotta tell you the truth, Hitchcock...
Can I tell you the truth? You and me, man.
We're gonna be co-captains.
But first I'm taking you to Japan!
I'm already packed!
I had three heart attacks that year and declared bankruptcy.
Hitchcock turned out just fine.
My grandpa was an old-school cop.
This was his hangover cure... Raw egg yolks.
Aaahhh!
You look like a corpse we just pulled out of the river.
Wrong. I look like a cool rock star who oded in his own pool. Big difference.
I told you not to let Jimmy Brogan distract you from your work.
So I assume you're not too hung over to do said work?
Pfft. Nope. It's like I never even drank.
And that's not a hangover cure.
What, that? Naw, it's just some...
Protein for my guns.
I drink one every morning before I lift.
So...
Gah!
Ah ha ha!
So good!
You can barely even tell it's a chicken embryo.
You should drink it all.
For your guns.
[Grunts]
Yeah.
[Gulping] Agh.
Ah, it's just like...
Fitness, right?
Oh, why did I do this?
According to your text, you were having ""the beef light of my loaf.""
What? No, no. Why did I use this algorithm?
We're only tracking people who use the stolen cards.
They might not be the same as the ones who stole them.
Here, switch seats with me.
Oh, wow. Your butt's really warm.
My butt's normal. Your butt's the weird one.
Don't be mad. It's nice.
All right, so if we ignore all these fraudulent purchases and go back far enough...
Here. Someone posted the stolen card numbers online from this IP address.
Not bad! You found the pattern.
All right, let's aspirin up and roll out!
Ah... ohh!
Ohh...
[Beep beep]
I'm glad you could be here for this.
[Beep beep] Mike Halbrook.
NYPD. Open up.
Put your head through the door.
My head?
We got a runner!
Stop! Hands in the air!
Oh, wow.
Hoo! Yeah!
Good job. I'm never drinking again.
Hey. You know, I was gonna take him out myself, but ladies first, so...
Relax, kid.
Being too hung over to chase a perp?
That's a classic old-school move.
You know, you are one of the last few good cops fighting against the rising tide of hair bags.
That's what you're gonna say in your article?
Ah, don't worry, you're gonna come out lookin' real good.
Especially after our talk in the bar.
Ah... So many good quotes!
Especially about Holt.
Cops are usually afraid to go after their captains like that, but you, sir, are old-school.
You know it.
Oh, pineapples...
What did you do?
Your witness counselor.
Detective Diaz, it's always a pleasure to see you.
This is not good.
The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven... Rosa hates him!
She's dressed right. We coached her.
She'll be okay.
Would you please state your name for the record?
To be perfectly candid...
My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.
Well, thank you for your candor regarding your own name.
[Chuckles]
Detective Diaz, would you please tell the court exactly how you're involved in this case?
I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine. Most of his cheek was caved in.
His head was basically a blood fountain.
I'm sorry, is this amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?
[Mouthing] Blinking.
[Police radio chatter]
Oh, no.
Brogan just sent me the quotes he's gonna run.
I slammed Holt like 50 times.
Listen.
""Holt would rather I wear a tie than solve a case. Holt cares more about catching clerical errors than catching bad guys.
Holt is way too verticulis""?
That's not even a word! What were you thinking?
We were just hanging out, being old-school.
He wasn't supposed to quote me.
I was off the record the whole time.
Oh, no wait.
I'm goin' on the record.
Jake Peralta... Can dance!
Whoo! Whoo!
[Singsong] Jimmy Brogan!
You need to fix this, okay?
Those quotes cannot run.
It would be devastating for Holt.
And the department. I'll fix it.
Brogan's a cool guy. We're friends now.
I'll just talk to him, awesome dude to awesome dude.
I should brush my teeth first, though, right?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's terrible.
Ugh!
Great advice, dummies.
I look like a psycho up there!
Yes. You have to pull it together.
That's not helping! That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous.
Rosa, I think you're nervous.
Of course I'm nervous!
What did you think was the problem?
We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.
But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby.
I can help! You just need to go to your happy place.
What's that? Sounds stupid.
Oh, everyone's happy place is different.
For me, I just imagine I'm slurping up the world's longest piece of linguini.
It just keeps going and going.
Every 20 feet of noodle, there's a sauce change.
I'm in my happy place right now.
Mmm... pesto.
[Slurps] Mmm! Carbonara!
Great! Now I'm starving!
Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan.
Thanks for meeting me.
Welcome to the Schvitz, kid.
The most comfortable place on earth.
It's like crawling back into your mother.
Is that something people wanna do?
What'd you wanna talk to me about?
So I read those quotes you sent me, and you... Wrote them so good.
The thing is...
I know I hid it incredibly well, but I was pretty drunk when I said that stuff, so...
Any chance you wouldn't print it?
Well, you said you were going on the record.
I was clearly not in control.
Well, maybe you should learn to handle your brown.
Eew.
Look, you know that I think you're like the number one hero of the 20th century.
But kinda feel like you're being unfair here.
""Feel like""? Listen to her, Suzanne Somers over here. Talk like a man.
All right, I will talk like a man.
You got me drunk and took advantage of me.
Oh, come on. Gah!
Look, I'm asking you nicely...
Please don't print the quotes.
And I'm telling you nicely, I'm printing them.
No, you're not.
What are you gonna do about it?
[Chuckles]
Hey, how'd it go with Brogan? Perfect.
Except I punched him in the face and made everything a billion times worse.
What?
Yeah.
So, Detective Diaz, you saw my client struggling with his boss, but you don't know who initiated the fight.
To be perfectly candid,
I was pretty sure it was the defendant.
Oh, to be perfectly candid, ""pretty sure"" is not definitive.
I think I know what happened.
Well, to be perfectly candid, no one cares what you think.
Do you actually know anything, or are you just guessing?
Your client instigated the fight.
I'm certain.
And I'm happy to tell you why.
[Silently] Yes!
She went to her happy place.
I know that, Boyle.
You punched Jimmy Brogan?
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that I needed to protect this precinct.
From things that I said about this precinct to a reporter while drunk and insisting he record me.
I shouldn't have done it. Unbelievable.
Every time I think you might make a decent Detective, you go and pull something like this.
I thought I could handle my brown.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's gross.
Go home!
You got the rest of the day to put your head on straight.
Got Halbrook to cop to every charge.
Nice work, Santiago. Thank you, sir.
Peralta figured out the pattern, though, so he should get credit for the collar.
Have you seen him?
I sent him home. He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.
Yeah. But that caveman kinda had it coming, don't you think?
Oh. He didn't tell you.
Tell me what? Never mind.
If Jake didn't tell you, he must have had a reason.
It's not my place. I'm disappointed in you, Santiago.
I thought you and I were close.
I know you're manipulating me...
But I love it, and I will tell you anything.
So Jake went to the Schvitz to talk to Brogan.
What are you gonna do about it?
[Chuckles]
There's nothing I can do...
Except to ask you nicely as a fan of you, your work, and the guys you wrote about...
Please don't print the quotes.
Sheesh. I didn't realize you were gonna get your panties all in a pretzel!
That's actually not technically possible.
I'm not wearing underwear.
It is swampy in here. My butt's like the everglades.
Look, I know you're trying to be legit in a hair bag world, so I will not print your quotes.
Ah, thank you, thank you!
That means the world to me.
And for the record, I know that Holt is a stickler, but he's actually a really good cop.
Don't worry about it. We're friends.
You don't have to stick up for that homo.
I really wish you hadn't just said that.
What, homo?
Ooh!
Thank you, Santiago. That'll be all.
Here she is.
Diaz, you did it.
They found him guilty on all charges.
Huh. Boyle's advice worked.
[Shrill giggle]
So...
Where's your happy place?
I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.
Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney.
And I'm beating the hell out of him.
I break a dining room table over his head.
Then I rip off his arm and shove it where the sun don't shine.
Then I reach down his throat and shake his hand.
Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.
I owe you one, Boyle.
Thank-you dinner. Tomorrow night.
Gribaldi's. It's all-you-can-eat linguini.
Yes!
Oh, my boyfriend's coming too.
Your what friend now?
All right.
Let's hear it.
Well, it's even worse than I imagined.
[Ahem] ""The new face of the NYPD is perfectly embodied by Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta...""
That's not so bad.
""Who cowers behind his desk all day like the true hair bag that he is.""
There it is.
""The old guard would have eaten a guy like Peralta for breakfast and unloaded him by lunch.""
Well, it's very colorful. And hurtful.
You can ignore that garbage, Santiago.
Jimmy Brogan wouldn't know a legit cop if he punched him in the face.
Well...
Guess I'm done with this.
Not good enough.
Three, two, one...
[Beep beep]
Welcome to the party, pal!
God, you love that movie.
It's Die Hard.

Oh, this is amazing.
This is so amazing.
Everything about this is amazing.
What are you talking about?
A virus got on the server and sent all of us an email with everyone's search histories.
Check this out.
Sergeant Jeffords searched the lnternet for ""undiscovered muscle.""
I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before.
I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.
Listen to this. Scully searched for ""how much fudge is in a calorie?""
I never found the answer, but it was a good question.
Boyle looked up, ""how to make desk yogurt.""
Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results.
Although the jar is really hot.
That's gross. And Amy searched for ""Daniel Craig hands"" plus ""close up.""
Ugh.
You should talk.
You searched for ""cheapest date possible.""
And I wear that search like badge of honor.
So, ready for dinner?
Here we go. [Grunts]
Would you like something sweet?
Or maybe savory?
Apple pie... And I'm stuck.
I'm stuck!
♪
Peralta.
Hey, Sal. To what do I owe the honor?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Boyle...
Jake: No!
I can't believe Sal's is gone.
This place is an institution.
It's the best pizza in the neighborhood.
Well, eighth-best.
But yeah, a tragedy.
I mean, any food-related crime is a tragedy.
[Siren blares]
Oh, no. Heads up, fire marshal.
Oh, Boone. What's that nimrod doing here?
Hey, Peralta.
Hey, Boone.
What are you doing here, you nimrod?
Uh, there was a fire.
Big question is, what are you doing here?
What, did somebody call in a missing doughnut?
Uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head.
But we found it. It was up your butt.
Jake: You're a fireman, you should know how to treat that burn.
Joke's on you, 'cause this is a fire, which means it is fire department jurisdiction.
So why don't you back off and let New York's bravest handle it?
You know they only call you that because ""New York's best at spraying stuff with water"" is too wordy.
Ha, well, it's too bad we all can't be as awesome as New York's finest, which by the way, sounds like my mom describing her dishware, which... and she's dead, so let's tread lightly on the response.
That's not fair.
Yeah.
Well, look, we heard this might be arson, so we wanted to check it out.
No, I'm not letting you onto my crime scene.
Okay?
All right, fine. You know what?
You're not invited to our next murder.
Good solve on the Herman Avenue burglaries.
Finish up the paperwork as soon as possible.
Your wish is my command.
No, that was actually a command.
So my command is your command.
Well, then I guess you still have all three of your wishes.
You're not a genie.
I know that.
Okay. We're leaving.
What was the name of the clerk we questioned about the second burglary?
Where do farts go?
I was reading Scully's searches.
Hey, why'd you do a search for ""magic-themed singles night""?
My last four dates were really boring, so I thought I'd mix things up.
Oh, wow. [Laughs]
[Poof]
Ta-da!
Oh, no.
What about you?
Why were you looking for real estate in Ropesburg, New Jersey?
Ropesburg P.D. Offered me a job as their new police Captain.
I turned it down.
Oh!
You... Captain. [Chuckles]
Oh... that's super...
Super cool.
If we're gonna figure out what happened at Sal's, we've gotta get past those firemen.
We need access. How 'bout this?
We light a bunch of fires throughout Brooklyn, and when the firemen go to ""fight the fires,"" we walk right into Sal's, the crime scene's ours.
Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department?
I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it...
Unless you think it is.
I do.
Like I said, Sal's is an institution, and it's the best pizza in the neighborhood.
I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best.
I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast.
Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel.
""Mouth-feel""? What is that?
The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive.
It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue.
Ugh, God.
Look, no, Sal's has the secret sauce recipe that puts all the other pizza places to shame.
But more importantly, fire marshal Boone is incapable of conducting a crime investigation.
All fire marshals are doofuses, but Boone is King doofus of doofus island.
Gasoline?
I'm pretty sure that's water.
Only one way to tell.
There were more ways to tell.
And he's their leader.
Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system.
His mother turned him in. His name is Corey Park.
My name is savant.
His web handle is ""savant.""
His people name is Corey Park.
Why'd you target us with your computer virus, Corey?
I don't know, I was bored, and it was easy to break into your weak-ass system.
It was like taking candy from a baby.
Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place?
Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!
Yes, sergeant, it is unwise to give babies candy.
If it's so easy for this gentlemen to break into our system, we may need to hire a new I.T. Director.
Why don't you and Gina get together on that?
I doubt I'll need Gina's help.
I'm sure she's busy anyway.
Use Gina. She's my assistant, and she has something to offer.
Trust me.
Man, don't be hacking into my stuff.
Charles: Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.
What are you two doing here?
You're a Detective, you detect it out.
Good one, bro.
I know, bro.
Yeah, bro.
Wow, it's like watching meet the press.
Boone reconsidered.
He wants you to take a look at the files.
Well, that's unexpected, but...
All right, fine, I'll...
[Laughs] It's not a file, bro.
It's a doughnut, because you're cops.
You sure?
[Laughs]
All right, I don't care if it's not our jurisdiction, we're solving this.
Would you like me to, uh, file that for you, Jake?
Just ask for the doughnut, Scully?
Can I have the doughnut, please?
Yes.
Thanks.
[Sighs]
It's good to see you, Sal.
I'm so sorry about the fire.
I can't believe it's gone, Jakey, all of it.
The pizza oven.
The first dollar bill I ever made.
[Tearing up] The 7-up fridge.
Hey, it's gonna be all right. You'll rebuild.
The fire department's been asking a lot of questions.
Oh, fire department questions. Let me guess.
""Uh, what part of my face do I put food in?""
""How do you count to one?""
""What's air?"" [Laughs]
They think I torched my own place.
You know I wouldn't do something like that, right?
Yeah, of course.
But can you think of anybody who might've done it?
I could think of ten pizzerias that want me out of the game.
That jerk Mario comes to mind.
We share a delivery radius.
Charles: Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast.
He might've wanted to move up the ladder.
Of one foodie weirdo's personal pizza email blast?
Yeah.
Okay, we'll start with him, then we'll move on to the rest of your competition, see if anything suspicious turns up.
It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings.
Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?
No, Charles, we gotta go fast.
Right, right, I'll just use my work bib.
No, no bib.
We're gonna solve this for you, Sal.
Sit tight.
The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?
Cone.
""C"" as in ""Captain."" ""O"" as in ""overlooked.""
What?
Nothing.
She said ""C"" as in ""Captain,"" ""O"" as in ""over...""
Yeah, I know how to spell cone.
Okay.
So, Ropesburg P.D.
You know someone there?
Nope.
So you were looking for a new job?
Nope.
Weird.
They just offered you Captain without considering anyone else?
Like Scully...
Because he's got so many years on the force.
Hey, guys, I think I put my gun in one of these boxes, and I don't know which.
You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?
Me? No, I am just filing evidence, sir.
Found my gun. It was in my holster.
My holster's on my butt.
Good solve, Scully.
Mario, this pie needs work.
Good consistency on the crust, but the cheese-to-sauce ratio is a travesty.
[Spits]
Do you have to spit?
In a word, yes.
Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice.
I take this very seriously.
So, Mario...
Let me tell you what I think happened.
Your credit card transactions are down by 1/3 in the last six months.
Meanwhile, over at Sal's, it was a bunch of smiling faces and happy stomachs.
One night, you snapped.
A little gasoline... fah! A little match.
And poof! No more Sal's. How right am I?
The night of the fire, I was at my father's funeral.
Oh... My condolences.
[Spits]
Ugh.
Charles: Gino...
This pizza is much better than last time.
You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.
But way more importantly, I did a little research, and it turns out you did six months in prison for a b&e.
I did. The night of the fire, I was at the prison giving a motivational speech on how parolees can turn their lives around.
Well, it's good to hear that the system works, and you are welcome.
Have a good one.



This is a dead end.
We've gotta check out that crime scene.
Can't. Firemen locked it down.
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.
Those hose monkeys can't stop us.
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.
Have a seat.
It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years.
Well, I know my way around a computer, that's for sure.
Query: What's your favorite Jay-Z song?
I'm sorry?
Favorite Jay-Z song?
[Chuckles] She's kidding.
Hmm. No, I'm not. What is it?
I don't know.
I'm sorry about her.
Okay.
What's your experience with cyber-security?
Uh, well, I added encryption software...
But seriously, what's your favorite Jay-Z song?
I don't know! Big pimpin'? It's big pimpin'!
Mm, wrong answer, friend.
And that's, um, how I got involved in, you know, systems analysis.
I'm sorry. I'm really nervous.
There's no need to be nervous.
Yeah, we're all just calm, cool, collected...
Wahh!
[Screams]
[Laughs] Oops.
Was that a little sudden?
What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?
Um...
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
He said, ""what's your biggest weakness [muffled] As an employee?""
That's just gross.
I'm sorry, I just have a skootch of gingivitis.
So I'm trying to treat that as best I can.
Sorry. You seem disgusted.
Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.
TV, computer...
""Ster-b-eo""?
Uh-oh, spelling error.
That's not very Captain-y.
Oh, my God, enough.
I just think that you meant ""stereo,"" not ""ster-b-eo.""
Did you mean ""ster-b-eo,"" Captain?
That's it. Get in my car, now.
And if you say another word, I promise you, you will regret it.
Aye aye, cap... Ow, okay.
Fine, I regret it. Ah... I'll go. I'm going.
These firemen are not moving.
We gotta distract 'em.
Tell 'em your little boy's cat got stuck up in a tree.
Ooh, undercover work. I love it.
I need more back story.
First off, can it be my daughter's cat?
Okay, but if you get made because of that, it's on you.
Fine. Let's talk about the cat.
Short-hair, long-hair? Tabby?
Short-hair, calico.
The son is adopted. Your wife is in a coma.
Oh, that's brutal. I like it.
Hey, guys? Guys, I really need your help.
My little boy, Brian, my angel, I bought him a short-haired calico after my wife fell into a coma... Motorcycle crash.
And now the cat's stuck in a tree.
Charles: He's a cute kid.
Kinda looks like you. Handsome guy.
Handsome little guy.
Oh, hey. Just got locked out, so...
He doesn't care.
[Grunts]
Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues.
Just struck out at tee-ball last week.
Everyone called him ""cryin' Brian.""
Boone: Hello, Peralta.
Aah!
You looking for something?
What is the deal with you and this second-rate pizza joint?
This place is a Brooklyn institution, and I'm here because you think Sal did it and you're wrong!
He did do it!
Sal was in financial trouble, he has no alibi, and in cases of arson, the owner always did it.
What's going on, sir?
What's going on is that Peralta has screwed with me for the last time, and now he's gonna pay.
Oh, you know what, Boone? Any time you want to...
[Grunts]
Well, that escalated fast.
[Grunting]
Charles: They're getting nervous, Jake! They're getting nervous!
[Both grunting]
Get off him, Boone! You big marshmallow!
Hey, break it up! Now!
Hey, hey, hey! Don't tell my guys what to do!
Don't tell me what to tell people what to do!
Well, make me not do it, tough guy.
Uh-oh.
[All grunting]
Hey, break it up!
I apologize, marshal Boone, for Detective Peralta's actions, something I find myself doing quite frequently.
In my defense, I was the only one saying we should stop hitting.
Stop hitting them!
Kicking them will hurt more!
Okay, I'm a reasonable man, so I'm just gonna say this.
Fire Peralta immediately.
He started a fight.
He overstepped his jurisdiction.
And he's obsessed with this pizza place.
What I'm obsessed with is how you're bungling this investigation.
They should write a song about it called welcome to the bungle.
Seriously, why are you dragging Sal's pizza through the mud?
That place is special.
Why's it special?
Because it's the best pizza in the neighborhood!
Well...
According to Charles's email blast, it's actually number eight.
Captain reads my blast.
Of course, it's the only one that measures mouth-feel.
What, are you kidding right now?
This isn't about pizza.
What's it actually about?
When I was a kid, I was shortstop on my little league team.
Oh, my God.
It's the truth. It's not a brag.
My dad was the coach, and after every game, he would take the team to Sal's.
Halfway through our last season, he left me and my mom, and the worst part about it was that I couldn't go with him to Sal's anymore.
Well, that's certainly not what I expected this to be about.
[Crying] Sorr... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
I mean, what kind of dad just...
Just leaves his son like that?
Look, you're... You're a cop and...
And I'm a firefighter, but underneath all of it, we're just two boys whose dads abandoned them.
And you and I, we're gonna solve this thing, together.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
But first, let's hug like men.
Oh, boy. This is happening.
[Crying]
Captain, get in here.
There, there.
There, there. There.
I'm coming in.
[Groans] Oh, Boyle.
Amy: What's going on?
Did you drive me out here to kill me?
I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold.
I wanted to show you Ropesburg.
This is Ropesburg?
You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job.
Miss Diaz! Are you here to reconsider?
We've bought the deputies bullets, like you suggested.
Hi, sergeant.
No, I'm still not interested.
At all.
But this is Detective Santiago.
She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job.
I...[Chuckles] Yes.
Can I ask what happened to the last Captain?
He quit to start a carpet cleaning business, because that was better than being Captain here because this is the most boring place on earth.
[Chuckles] She doesn't mean that.
It's okay. It's true.
Gotta be known for something.
[Chuckles nervously]
So of all the candidates that you interviewed today, who do you think I should hire?
Well, the interviews got a little off-track.
But I'd go with Simon Walker.
Computer science degree, worked for the board of ed for ten years.
That guy? No way.
He yelled at me when I asked him the same question about Jay-Z three times in a row.
Why does that matter?
Because whoever takes this I.T. Job is gonna have to deal with Hitchcock asking how to log in to his email every single day forever.
How do you think Professor short fuse is gonna handle that?
Fine, what about this guy?
Mm, no. He was scared of everything.
Do you remember Rosa's reaction last time the printer jammed?
I'll pay for that.
Fine, what was with the flossing?
Mm, a precinct is a pretty gross place, ter-bear.
There's blood, wounds, Scully's feet.
You need a strong stomach, and that lady did not have one.
Plus, we already have the perfect candidate already: Savant.
That punk who hacked us?
Precisely.
Captain, turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength, like Paris Hilton re: Her s*x tape.
Get to the point.
Savant tore our walls down, but he can build them back up, taller and thicker than ever.
But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?
His mom ratted him out, so I bet he'd love a steady paycheck to get out of that snitch's house.
[Laughs] If I had a mic right now, I'd drop it.
There we have it.
And here's the file you wanted.
Well, it's hard to believe I'm gonna say this, because I've spent most of my adult life hating you and everything you stand for, but...
Thanks.
I'm not gonna lie, my therapist is gonna be very proud of me.
That's weird.
Any reason you can think of one of your guys would've forced this cabinet open while they were putting the fire out?
No, no. I can't.
Looks like it was jimmied open with a crowbar.
Oh, my God. I know who did it.
Come on, I'll explain it on the way down.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't believe I'm offering this to a cop, but...
Do you want to take the pole down?
Oh, my God, yes.
Whee!
Let justice be served.
Did you get it?
Uh-huh. My turn?
Nope. No time.
Whoo!
We know you burned down Sal's, gino.
You hated him because his pizza was better than yours.
That's not true.
Gino's pizza's always been the tastiest.
Wrong.
According to Boyle's email blast, it was downright lousy before.
That's what made it so suspicious when he suddenly loved it.
[Distorted] Much better than last time.
[Spits]
The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce.
Oh, Marone, the sauce.
Continue.
And that was your mistake.
You didn't just burn Sal's down, you also stole his secret sauce recipe.
Here's a picture of the cabinet in which said recipe was held.
Busted open with a crowbar.
Look familiar?
Also, your so-called motivational speech down at the prison ended at 5:00 P.M., leaving you plenty of time to get back to Sal's and burn it to the ground.
So I guess there's only one thing left to say.
Both: Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest...
[Clears throat] Excuse me. No.
Do you mind?
This is my collar... I think I can handle this.
If I'm not wrong.
Yeah, but I actually did all the work.
See, I knew you would... You know what? Fine.
Go ahead, I don't care.
Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest for arson. Yes!
Said it first.
Real mature.
Very mature.
Off we go.
So what'd you think of Ropesburg?
It's, uh... quaint.
It's whack, and you know it.
Their number-one crime is tricycle theft.
There's a bakery attached to the precinct.
Come on, Santiago.
You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?
I can't help it. I'm competitive.
I have seven brothers, and I was the only girl.
I always had to fight for a place at the table.
Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore.
We work in a police force full of dudes.
We gotta have each other's backs, okay?
You saying you have my back?
Yeah, I got your back.
Don't smile. I'm still mad at you.
I thought we were having a moment.
Moment's over. Shut up.
Hitchcock: Hey, sarge.
He made my computer smarter.
All I have to do is put my thumb on that thing, and it opens up all my electric mails.
[Laughs] You seem real smart, man.
Oh, and look, and you play with toys.
Savant, you're part of the nine-nine now.
We look after each other.
Hey, ball, if savant was to do anything to harm this precinct, would I destroy him?
Answer uncertain. Try again.
Peralta, fire marshal Boone just called.
He told me you should check your drawer?
Oh, look at that.
I've been booned.
Well, the joke's on him, because I was out of shaving cream.
I see we are once again at war with the fire department.
You are not to retaliate.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, sir.
In fact, I'm gonna send over a little peace offering: Some of Sal's famous sauce.
Now, Boyle!
[Alarm blares]
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Pleasure working with you, Boone.
Run, Charles!
[Laughter]
Come on... whoa! Get that guy!

Happy Turkey Day.
Yes! Right out of the gate.
What? What's going on?
We're playing Boyle Bingo, Thanksgiving edition.
Everyone filled out their cards with possible Charles-related scenarios.
First to bingo gets 100 bucks.
I had ""Boyle calls it 'Turkey Day'"" on the center square.
""Boyle explains that they ate lobsters at the first Thanksgiving.""
They did. Back in that time, they called lobsters ""ocean bugs.""
And... I'll just mark it off for you.
I think got the winning card here.
Boyle tells us that he played Pocahontas in his third grade play.
All the girls were too big.
This is a fun one... ""Boyle says, 'Gobble, gobble, gobble.'""
Well, now that I know you want me to say that, I'll just say it with two gobbles.
Gobble, gobble...
Gobble. God, it just sounds right that way.
Ugh. I don't like this game.
Ha! ""Boyle objects to Boyle Bingo.""
Come on, guys.
Boyle says, ""Come on, guys.""
That's two for Terry.
Well, guess what. I can spoil your little game by sitting over here quietly all day and doing nothing.
Oh!
Aah!
Anybody have ""Boyle falls on the floor?""
Jake: No one?
That's a victory.
That's a victory for Boyle. Boom!
All: Boyle says, ""Boom!""

Season 1, Episode 10 ""Thanksgiving""
Jake: Check it out, chair jockeys.
While you were busy tickling the ivories on your computers, I was doing a bust.
Cocaine!
Thanks, Lucius.
He ran, I pursued.
Whole thing turned into an awesome car chase.
[Tense music]
Aah.
NYPD!
[Grunts]
[Tires screeching]
Come on. Move, move, move.
Hey there, criminal. It's me, Johnny Law.
Well, at least you're done early, so you have time to go home and change for my Thanksgiving dinner.
Ugh. Why do we have to dress up for Thanksgiving.
I don't even celebrate that stuff.
The whole holiday is based on overeating.
We should be wearing velvet track suits and diapers.
Jacket and tie.
Rosa's even wearing her formal leather jacket.
It's the one without any blood on it.
You're gonna dress up, and you're gonna give a toast about what you're thankful for.
Start preparing.
Oh, I prefer not to prepare for my toasts.
I just wing 'em like scat jazz.
[Imitates jazz]
Are we singing?
No, no, no, no.
[Singing opera]
OK... That's nice.
You don't have to... [Singing opera]
[Whispering] I'm not dressing up for your party.
[Singing opera]
Damn it, Boyle. You left the fridge open.
The door couldn't shut because of your empty pizza box.
Pizza? Please. This is a butternut squash and truffle butter flatbread.
Everything's spoiled. My lunch is ruined.
My chicken, my potatoes, my pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt.
Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
I love yogurt.
So this is your lunch for, like, the month?
I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass.
My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids.
That was everything in my fridge.
Scully.
Hey-a, Sarge.
I know you got a secret stash of food hidden somewhere.
Oh, no.
Where is it?
No, I don't.
Is it in your pockets?
Oh, come on.
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets. Turn around.
Sarge. [Grunts] Sarge!
Go limp, Scully.
[Grunts] This is fun.
Release your sweets.
Can I help you, Santiago?
Oh, Captain, didn't expect to see you there.
In my office?
So, I just wanted to make sure that you knew about the Thanksgiving dinner I'm hosting for the squad after work.
Yes, I received your ""Save the date"" decorative gourd, your ornamental cornucopia, and this beautiful handcrafted card of a turkey wearing a top hat.
It's a pilgrim's hat.
Where's the buckle, Santiago?
The buckle.
My husband's out of town for work, so of course I will attend your dinner.
Cool. Whatever.
Yeah, don't worry about it, either way.
It's not a big deal.
[Whispers] Yes!
Why so excited?
Did you make the cover of ""Hair Pulled Back"" magazine?
The captain is coming to my party.
I'm gonna give a toast, tell him how thankful I am to have him in the precinct, and officially ask him to be my mentor.
Wait, are you only hosting dinner because you wanna suck up to Holt?
Not cool. This was supposed to be about friendship.
You said you were only coming to see if my apartment was the reason I was single, or if it was my personality, like you suspected.
Yeah, but that was before I knew I could get up on this high horse.
Love the view up here.
Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop.
Same to you, Your Honor.
Oh, what judge were you talking to?
That was my mother.
You call your mom ""Your Honor""?
She's a federal judge in the Ninth Circuit.
What else would I call her?
Yeah, okay.
Captain, paperwork is all done on that drug bust.
What else you got for me?
Nothing. All open cases are assigned.
Come on, there's gotta be something I can investigate.
No, there's nothing.
All right, well, when there's nothing, there's nothing, you know? What can you...
Whoa! Who did that?
Don't worry, sir. I will stay here all night figuring this out.
I know what you're up to here, Peralta.
Damn straight. I'm trying to catch the mad paper scatterer.
You want an excuse to skip Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner, because for some reason, you refuse to celebrate this holiday like a normal person.
Fine. You're right. I wanna do what I do every year -
Sit at home, watch football, and eat mayo nut spoonsies.
Those are spoonfuls of mayo, sprinkled with peanuts.
That's revolting.
Maybe so, but it's what I invented when I was six because my mom was working, so I had to make dinner for myself.
My sad story trumps your insult.
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Both: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Thank you, Boyle.
If a case opens up, it's yours.
But if not, you will be at Santiago's as a professional courtesy. Dismissed.
From what? I thought we were just chatting.
We never chat anymore.
Oh, my God, Amy, that's so cool that you still live with your grandmother.
I live alone. This is my stuff.
I like quilts.
Stop. Each sentence is getting sadder.
It looks like you live on the set of Murder, She Wrote.
Well, I gotta say, it's not as bad as I thought it would be.
I mean, the football game's not on, so I can still watch it later at home.
And it's kind of cool to visit a time before electricity was invented.
I have to practice my toast.
God, how long is that?
Eight pages.
Single-spaced?
Double-sided.
Santiago style.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, excuse me. Can we please eat?
My body is starting to digest itself.
Terry needs nutrients.
No eating until the captain gets here.
Okay? Sorry.
Don't apologize.
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving at your house than with my sister.
""Things you find a the beach.""
For ""S"", I had seagull.
Good one, Diana!
Ice cream break.
Yay!
Yay.
It's so pleasant and boring.
But, Holt, at your house, surrounded by these idiots?
Guaranteed train wreck. Thanks for the invite.
[Doorbell chimes]
He's here! Okay, he's here, everybody. Be cool.
Hitchcock, why do you have your shirt off?
Can't spill food on your shirt if you're not wearing one.
What...
Captain Holt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Your apartment was very easy to locate.
Thank you so much. You look beautiful.
Weirdest conversation ever.
Nice work, you two.
Before we eat, I'd like everyone to go around and say what they're thankful for this year.
[Sighs] Fine, I'll go first.
I am thankful that Thanksgiving only comes once a year.
People stuff themselves, and then at midnight they run to appliance stores and trample each other to death.
It's a garbage holiday. [Sniffles]
I'm sorry, I just get emotional when I talk about how bogus Thanksgiving is.
I'll just go.
I actually prepared a little something.
You did?
When I was a little girl, playing cops and robbers...
[cell phone ringing] Excuse me.
Please. Continue, Santiago.
Or I could wait.
No waiting, just toasting.
I want you to toast. Now I wanna eat toast.
Give me some toast!
Holt: OK, I'll be right there.
I have to head back to the precinct.
No. Why?
Someone stole $10,000 from the evidence lockup.
Yes! Oh, awesome.
Why is that awesome?
It's a case.
You said I could hop on any case that came up.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
Have fun, you guys. Let's roll!
You'd think that one place money would be safe is a police station.
Jake: I hear that.
Remember when Santiago called you beautiful?
Yes, that was odd.
We need to get this money back, the exact bills, so the commissioner's office won't make our lives hell.
What is this?
Jake: Uh, this is Terry dancing.
People do the weirdest stuff in the evidence lockup when they think no one's watching.
Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Jake: Okay, so here's our money.
Fast forward.
Jake: Hold it, hold it, go back.
There's our guy. Got him.
Okay, we should start by checking all the perps that were released from holding today.
Good idea.
And if's none of them, we may miss Santiago's altogether.
Thanksgiving is dead!



Santiago, can we please, please just eat?
What if captain Holt and Jake are coming back?
Hang on. I have a toast.
I am thankful to have someone in my life who gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning.
And I hope that my relationship with this person will only grow more intimate.
Who are you talking about?
Um, Hitchcock.
OK, enough is enough. I'm eatin'.
[Grunts]
What's in these?
Potatoes, butter, a little milk.
Oh, and I ran out of salt, so I used baking soda.
Why wouldn't you?
They're both white powders.
Of course they're interchangeable.
Yeah.
[Grunts]
There were two men released from holding today that were the right height and weight to be our thief on the security footage.
Even if it is one of them, how will we know?
Easy. The guy on the footage was left-handed.
We just give all of our suspects some made-up form to sign, and see which hand they use.
All right, amigo.
Punch it.
Good. Did that. Now punch it.
Uh-huh. Safety first. Punch it!
Okay, see, now I just feel like you're messing with...
Anyone want seconds?
Can't. I'm so stuffed.
Scully: Amy, the toilet's overflowing.
What? Ew!
Scully, what did you do?
And the night gets worse better.
I didn't do it.
Although, I understand why you suspect me.
Well, then who clogged it?
[Flushes]
So none of you ate anything?
Terry, you said you ate the whole turkey.
Toilet.
I ate one string bean. It tasted like fish vomit.
That was it for me.
But I'm a good cook.
You all ate those brownies I brought in last week.
I thought they were erasers.
Charles said he loved them.
I'm a textbook people-pleaser. I have a serious problem.
This was great though. You must be so proud.
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.
Everybody go home. We're just... We're done hanging out together.
I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go to the bar, they serve food there.
That's a great idea.
Oh, look at that.
""Boyle saves Thanksgiving.""
Does it really say that?
No.
But it does say, ""Boyle believes obvious lie.""
Damn it.
So what's our strategy here?
I'm thinking maybe we could do the whole thing in character.
I'll play detective Bart Barley...
Tightly wound, hates violence against animals.
And you're my partner, Gerald Jimes...
A man who solved every crime, but one...
The murder of his wife.
Peralta, take this seriously.
I am. As seriously as you're taking the search for the man who killed Jane Jimes.
Your only clue? He wore a yellow sweater.
Eh?
You're considering it. Let's get in there.
NYPD. [Knocks]
What's going on? I'm right in the middle of carving turkey.
Jake: I'm vegetarian. Eating meat is murder.
I hate violence against animals.
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
We overlooked our release form we were supposed to have you sign. We apologize.
Yeah, he's really right-handed. Let's go.
♪ Look out, bad guys ♪
♪ it's Barley and Jimes ♪
♪ Barley and Jimes are on the case ♪
Please refrain from make believe this time.
Fine. [Knocks]
Evening, ma'am. NYPD. Barley and Jimes.
We're looking for Donny Romano.
Ugh. Come in.
Donny, what'd you do? Cops are here.
Aww.
What do you guys want?
Sorry to bother you, sir, my partner here forgot about a form we need you to sign.
What's happening, Donny? What'd you do?
I didn't do anything. It's not my fault.
Same old story. It's never you, is it?
What did Donny do?
I swear, ma, I don't know what this is about.
Why won't you ever believe me?
'Cause I raised a liar.
You lie.
Shut up, ma.
Hey, don't talk to ma like that.
Don't you tell me what to do, Louie!
Excuse me.
Hey!
Not the rolls!
George, do something.
Excuse me, if...
[overlapping arguing]
You know, you're gonna get hurt.
Get off now.
Get off.
My wife was murdered by a man in a yellow sweater!
It's the one case I can't solve.
Don't fight with family.
It can all go away so quickly.
Sign this?
Jake: That's a hell of a breakthrough, Jimes. I'm proud of you.
Also, we just caught our man.
He signed with his right hand.
That's right, he did.
But he didn't do it.
He did.
What?
Couldn't help but notice you throwing those rolls with your left hand, boss.
Not mention, this hoodie matches our security footage exactly.
You stole that money when you came in to pick up your brother from holding today, didn't you?
Damn it.
Nice work, Peralta.
So where's the money now?
It's not here, all right?
I bet it all on the football game.
My bookie has it.
Yes!
The case continues.
This is not good.
Right. Sorry, Jimes.
His father was murdered by a bookie.
I know you miss him.
Our perp says the bookie operates out of a hidden back room.
Try to blend in.
Good idea.
I'll just age myself 60 years, become Chinese and female.
Here we go. Whoosh.
Did it work?
$10 to play.
Oh, we're just looking around.
$40 just to look around.
All right, we'll play.
$15 to play.
All right.
Tommy, can we order some food?
The cook's gone. I sent him home.
Do you have any more of these pretzels?
Sure.
I'm gonna call the cook.
Smart. Good call.
Hey, rough night?
Yeah, it certainly hasn't gone according to plan.
Aw, no. Aw, Amy, I was ordering a drink called ""A Rough Night.""
It's tequila with a nicotine patch.
Right.
How do I get Holt to pay attention to me?
He sure spends a lot of time on Peralta.
Maybe I should start screwing up, like Jake does.
I can act out too, you know?
Please do.
Okay. Watch this.
[Glass shattering]
Oops.
Out... All of you.
But the cook is coming back.
Out!
Fine!
But I'm taking these olives.
[Sighs]
Sorry. Happy Turkey Day.
[Speaking Chinese]
Ah.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
These tiles are either game pieces or candy.
Game pieces. Here we go.
[Overlapping chatter]
I think I just won.
The guy by the bathroom seems very interested in the commotion you just made.
Yeah, and he's been waiting for the toilet since we got here.
Ten-to-one that's not a bathroom, and he's a lookout.
Let's go.
You got it.
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.
[Speaking Chinese]
There is nothing here.
Don't worry, guys, I found food.
Are you eating packing peanuts?
Okay, I do keep a secret stash of food in the office.
I knew it! Where?
[Screams] Where?
Sarge, am I too heavy?
No. Where is it?
There, the one with the water stain.
There's a lot of food up there?
Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.
[All screaming]
I think the rats got to it.
You think?
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.
Okay, it's over.
Thanksgiving time of death: Now.
No, this will not be our Thanksgiving.
All right, you all wait here.
Give me an hour. Terry, to the door.
I'm just gonna put you down, man.
Yeah, totally. That makes sense. That makes sense.
Hey, there. Bathroom?
There's another one upstairs, over there.
Aah. Oh! [Grunts]
Oh. Never mind. Let's go.
What, it's really a bathroom?
No, no, no.
There's tons of illegal stuff happening in there.
But they're watching the football game and I DVR'd it.
I don't wanna see the score.
What?
Okay, fine. We'll go get the stolen money.
NYPD. Freeze.
Change the channel and then freeze.
Put it down!
Holt: Put it down, put it down.
This is a weird request, but will you switch places with me?
I really don't wanna see the score.
[Both grunting]
Oh, yeah. Thank you. That's so much better. Oh!
Why are there so many TVs in here?
Thank you.
The money was still in the bookie's safe. All the numbers match.
Let's head back to Santiago's party.
Ah, no thanks.
I think I'm gonna head home and watch the football game, which was ruined for me!
What's your problem with celebrating Thanksgiving?
It's a sucky holiday. It's always sucked.
My mom worked. My dad was gone. And I sat at home, watching football.
Look, Jake.
I came from a very formal family.
My parents were not especially affectionate.
Really? ""Your Honor"" wasn't a big snuggler?
But the beauty of being an adult is that you can make a new family with new traditions.
Well, that's nice, captain, but I don't have a new family yet, so I guess I'm stuck with my awesome old traditions.
Okay. I'll tell the squad you couldn't make it.
Thank you.
Before you go, can I borrow some money?
I'm getting some pretty serious vibes from Wendy over there, and I'd like to take her someplace special.
Hey. What are y'all doing here?
Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar.
Then we got attacked by rats. It's the best Thanksgiving ever.
Fascinating.
Happy Turkey Day. Right through there, gentlemen.
Not a lot of places are open, so this will be a multiethnic, nontraditional Thanksgiving.
Charles: It's a real culinary challenge. Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.
Make it five.
You eat with your eyes, so the plating alone...
[screams] Five, Boyle!
Captain?
Hm?
I wanna tell you something.
I think you're...
Like, when I was a little girl...
You think I'm like when you were a little girl?
Forget it. The moment's passed.
Is this about your toast?
How'd you get that?
Gina gave it to me.
It's very well-written.
There are several compelling anecdotes. The fonts suit the tone.
Good work.
I do feel, however, the word choice could've been improved in spots.
I marked them ""Awk"" for ""Awkward.""
That was the best thing anyone's ever said to me.
""I marked them 'Awk' for 'Awkward'?""
It's advice. He's mentoring me.
Yes!
So this is kind of a play on your typical Thanksgiving dinner.
For turkey, we have the Peking duck with a veggie samosa stuffing.
Charles: The potatoes are the empanadas with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy.
And for dessert, some seasonal gelatin cups.
Okay, I ran out of money.
They're from when Hitchcock got his colonoscopy.
Bon appétit.
I'm here, I'm here.
[All cheer]
Finally something to actually be thankful for.
What are you wearing?
Santiago said to dress up, so...
Well, you look beautiful.
That's my thing now. I'm just owning it.
Okay. Before we eat...
Nope, not doing that again. Move.
Could you pass the, uh...
You get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it.
Okey-doke, let's eat.
Hey, thanks for giving a copy of my toast to Holt.
That was nice of you.
Oh, you're welcome.
I mean, you don't have to get so freaked out around him.
You were just trying to tell him you respect him.
Okay.
But, to be honest, I kinda gave it to him as a prank, 'cause I thought it would be super embarrassing for you.
But I'm happy it worked out.
But I would've been happy if you hated it.
But I'm happy you didn't.
So, you pretty much got the disaster night you were hoping for?
Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had and ruined it.
Excuse me! Uh, so, earlier at Amy's, I didn't give a real toast because...
I didn't know what to say.
But, since that time, a wise, unsmiling man named Gerald Jimes made me realize what I am thankful for.
So, I'd just like to say I'm happy to be here...
With my family.
My super-weird family, with two black dads and...
Two Latina daughters and two white sons and...
Gina, and...
I don't know what you are... Some strange giant baby?
To the Nine-Nine!
all: To the Nine-Nine!
That was perfect.
Uh, Boyle cries! I got Boyle Bingo!
all: No...
Yeah!

Al right, you take the skinny one on the right, and I'll take the big one on the left.
NYPD! Santa, stop hitting Santa.
What's going on here?
I've been on this corner for six years.
Suddenly, this guy shows up.
Santa ♪2: Hey, you don't own this corner. I got a charity too.
Canine diabetes? Who cares about fat dogs?
They can't give themselves shots, they got paws.
All right. Calm down, calm down.
Jake: Boyle, frisk the skinny one.
I've gone 42 years without a lump of coal.
I'm not gonna start now.
Are you kidding me?
All right, fine. Come here, buddy.
[Yells]
Hey, hey, hey!
Hit him in his fat cherry cheeks.
Ooh!
Ugh, that felt wrong.
Knife!
Skinny Santa's got a knife!
Ahh!
That's right. Boom!
Just kicked Santa in the testicles.
Merry Christmas.
♪
Looking good. Happy Hanukkah.
You look happy.
Let me guess.
Your egg sandwich fell on the floor and they gave it to you for free.
No. Can you do that?
Why doesn't everyone just drop their sandwiches on the floor?
[Sighs] I was trying to insult you.
And instead, you gave me an amazing life hack.
Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have. But this is embarrassing.
I didn't get you a present.
The gift is for Captain Holt.
It's one of six presents I got him representing the six lessons that he's taught me: Determination, wisdom, posture...
Excuse me, everyone.
As you may know, this is the holiday season.
Detectives sometimes feel the urge to buy their captains holiday presents.
Please refrain from doing so.
Under no circumstances do I want a present.
Peralta, my office.
Jake: Roger that!
Oh, my God, I have to return so many items.
[Whispering] I know.
Shut up.
Thank you for joining us, Peralta.
This is deputy chief Gerber.
Ah, merry Christmas, chief.
And a very merry Christmas to you, Captain.
Ho, ho, ho!
Gerber: Captain Holt has received a number of death threats.
Oh.
I really came in here with the wrong energy.
Captains receive meaningless threats all the time.
It's really no big deal.
Of course, totally.
I mean, why would a death threat be a big deal?
Oh, that's right. 'Cause it threatens death.
It's a hoax.
I didn't wanna alarm the squad.
So, please, keep this between us.
Awesome. I'm great at secrets.
Santiago got you like six presents.
Well, it may be a hoax, but protocol dictates that Captain Holt have a security detail with him at all times.
He's chosen you for that detail.
Interesting.
And not at all surprising. I'm his favorite.
Tell me, what would this job entail?
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt. Uh-huh.
You'll be entirely in control of his movements. Amazing.
He will not leave your sight. [Sighs]
You have the authority to make decisions that you feel are in the best interest of his safety.
Oh, my God.
Basically you'll be completely in charge.
Oh, well, it sounds really tough, but of course I accept, and I will be willing to put my life at risk for this man to have to follow all of my orders.
Thank you! This is the best Christmas ever.
God bless us, everyone!
Hey, my flight is at 8:00 tonight.
It's domestic.
You think I'll be safe if I get to the airport five hours early?
Five? No way!
You gotta do seven. Seven minimum.
Seven. I knew it. Yep.
Why are you going on a singles cruise?
I thought you were into Rosa.
Well, I am.
But I've begun to feel like there's a slight chance Rosa may not love me back.
Hey, how about we grab some dinner tonight, just you and me?
That's nice, and I like you as a person, but I'm just not interested in you...
Romantically.
Coolio!
Hey, what say you we grab a drink?
You're starting to make this weird.
I'm not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend.
Got you. Rain check.
A rose... for Rosa.
Listen to me!
The healthy thing for you to do is move on.
So we both decided the healthy thing for me to do is to just move on.
I'm impressed, Charles. That's very mature.
Thanks. You know what's funny?
I realized I sometimes... Oh, no, don't get comfy.
This wasn't an invitation to keep talking.
Gotcha. Rain check on the convo.
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
Peralta's busy, so let's just get started.
Now, the Captain won't allow us to give him all the presents we bought him.
You are the only one that did that.
But we can make him the greatest Christmas card of all time.
We're gonna Santa hats and big sweaters and take a picture of us all in a lineup.
Terry: I'm sorry, Santiago, but I don't have time for that.
My psych evaluation is today.
They're gonna decide if I'm ready to make it back on the streets.
Why do you care what they think?
Psychologists are just people who weren't smart enough to be psychics.
Amy: Don't worry, sergeant. We'll add you in later.
[Charles sighs]
Sorry, I gotta go too. My flight is in...
Ah, eight hours.
I can make it.
I'll buy a sandwich on the plane.
Boyle!
So if Peralta, Boyle, and the sergeant are out...
Fine, everyone just go.
Yeah.
I could take a pic of myself dressed up as an elf.
Elfie-selfie.
Not that...
But I think there is something you could help me with.
You gonna sit there all day?
Affirmative, stone eagle.
That's the Secret Service codename I gave you.
Just sitting here doing my job, watching, protecting, bossing you around.
Now, for your safety, if you could open up your lnternet browser and search the words ""pigs"" and ""jet skis,"" and that's an order.
[Holt sighs]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going, Cold Mountain?
I changed your codename.
To use the restroom.
I'm only asking this for your safety.
Is it a number one or a number two?
Your silence indicates number two.
Let me do some recon. [Grunts]
It's all clear, sir.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Cold Mountain is on the move.
I repeat, Cold Mountain is rolling to the can.
Sergeant Jeffords, thank you for coming in today.
We are here to assess your readiness for active duty, and if all goes I will stamp this release form, you can go back in the field.
Well, I think I'm ready.
I am no longer fixating on my fears, ha.
Good. But for today, let's... fixate on those fears.
Okay. Um...
That sounds fun.
Let's begin by talking about your baby girls and your wife, and what would happen to them if you died...
In the line of duty.
I popped your pillow.
Jake: Captain...
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going home to work in peace.
That's a negative, ice veins. Changed your codename again.
Do you know why I chose you to be my security escort?
Because I'm a modern-day Sherlock Holmes?
No, I chose you because the threat is not real.
Mm-hmm.
And I thought you'd have no problem breaking the rules and letting me get my work done.
Now... let me go.
Well, you thought wrong.
You can't go home. It's protocol.
But if you really wanna get outta here, you can come to my mom's.
She lives nearby.
Or I can lock you up in the holding cell with an armed escort.
Totally your call.
Fine. We will go to your mother's house.
I guess I am curious to see where...
This all started.
Shotgun.
So... this is my mom's place.
You can just throw your jacket in the closet.
That's a bathroom.
Water closet. My mom's British.
Hmm.
Why are there no photographs of you?
No holiday decorations.
Nothing but...
Motel art.
This isn't your mom's apartment.
It's a safe house, son! You've been protected.
Don't say ""son.""
Get outta my way.
Look, you wouldn't stay at your desk and you evaded your protection detail.
I'm sorry, but I've gotta order you to stay.
I love giving you orders.
The only way you're gonna keep me here is if you physically stop me.
Can you do that, Peralta?
[Indistinct mumbling]
I didn't think so.
Jordan. Ahh!
Jake: Oh, no.
We're handcuffed together and we've lost the key.
Falconer one to HQ, stone eagle is in the cage.
I repeat, stone eagle is in the cage.
I told you the death threat was not serious.
So what on earth are you doing?
Look, I know you think that I'm just goofing around, but I got a direct order from your boss to protect you.
So from this point forward, we're on lockdown.
Fine. But before we go into lockdown...
Too late. You're on it.
I'd like to text my husband and tell him I'll be coming home late tonight.
All right, but for security reasons,
I get to craft the message.
Let's start with a pleasant greeting.
How about... ""Hello, honey.""
You will not craft the message.
Okay, Roger that. ""Honey's"" wrong.
How about ""hello, husband""?
How about ""hello, sir""?
You call each other ""sir""? Give me my phone.
Fine.
I'll give you some privacy.
Maybe put Hitchcock's head on top like an angel.
Mm.
Gina: Like that?
No, put it behind the tree.
Amy: Thanks for helping me make this card.
You're so good at this stuff.
[Laughs] I know. I'm good at everything.
All right, so here's all the pictures of Rosa that we have.
Which one should we use?
[Groans] She never smiles. Is her mouth broken?
Well, what about if we...
Flip those lips?
Oh, God. Oof!
Gina: That's horrifying.
We have to get a picture of Rosa smiling.
Holt's card has to be perfect.
Guys... I got this.
I can make Rosa smile.
Just keep your cameras ready.



Making coffee?
Can you make another cup for senor tickle and his nueve amigos?
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
What the hell, Hitchcock? Ow, ahh! Ow, ow, ow!
I think you sprained senor tickle.
Next time, I break it off.
[Hitchcock whimpers]
Ow!
All right.
My safe house, my rules.
This is a no tie zone.
A hungry safe house is an unsafe safe house.
A fun safe house is a safe safe house.
My serve.
Ah.
I thought you said you've never played this.
It's very intuitive.
Let's have another sandwich.
A safe house- watching safe house is a safe safe house house.
I've already seen the film.
I enjoyed it.
Wow, I would not have guessed that.
You see, those are the kind of things that you learn when you're handcuffed together.
And that is the true meaning of Christmas.
[Knocking on door]
Who knows we're here?
Get behind me.
No, no! Going over!
Standard protocol suggests that you put me in another room before you open the door.
But since you've cuffed us together...
I order you to be quiet. [Sighs]
Come on.
Freeze, sicko! Ah!
Jake, it's me, Charles from work.
Okay, let's switch gears, do a little word association.
What do you think of when I say the word ""bottle""?
Liquor store, holdup, gun, die.
How about ""grass""?
Marijuana, drugs.
Gun, die.
Cat.
Kitten.
Cute.
Calm. False sense of security.
Gun, die.
What are you doing?
You gonna stamp my form?
No. I just didn't want the ink to dry out.
Boyle, what are you doing here?
I thought you had to catch a flight.
I do. My flight is in six hours.
But the Captain texted me to come, so I'm here. What?
You texted Boyle when you told me you were texting your husband?
As the person who's completely in charge here, I am very disappointed in you.
I'm changing your codename to ""bad boy.""
Oh, I can't imagine what it's like to be disappointed at someone under your command.
Okay, I see what you're doing. Tushy.
It's touche.
Well, I'm in charge, and I say it's tushy.
Boyle?
I've heard it both ways.
Please don't involve me in this.
I'm just here to uncuff the Captain and take him to his old precinct.
What?
Old precinct? Wait a minute.
You weren't going home at all.
You were going to investigate the threat because it's not a hoax, it's real!
Wrong, it's not real. You're lying!
You have a tell.
When you lie, the corner of your mouth moves, and it just moved.
[Slowed down] Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!
Fine.
I believe the threat is real, though I'm not sure who's behind it.
But this is my problem, and I'm gonna solve it on my own.
Boyle, uncuff me. Don't do it, Charles.
I'll take you on that trip to the botanical gardens we've always talked about.
Uncuff me, and that's a direct order.
Don't do it, best friend. Botanical gardens.
Ah! This is just like Christmas at my parents' house.
Why do they have separate dining rooms?
[Scoffing] I...
Both: No!
Jake: That was not one of the options!
I couldn't choose, I love you both so much.
Who wants to watch safe house?
So, including letters, e-mails, and texts from a blocked phone, we have received ten threats.
How many people have you put away that might want you dead?
I've arrested over 600 people.
Brag.
Boyle, will you please read the transcripts of the threats he's received?
Yup.
""Die, die, die."" ""Die, Holt, die.""
Okay, a little obvious.
""You will drown in your own blood.""
Better.
Although I would've gone with the whole, ""I'm gonna staple my face onto your face"" thing.
Human skin mask. Classic.
The next one is ""I'm gonna send you off the deep end.""
""Drowning"" and ""deep end.""
Almost sounds like he's talking about a swimming pool.
It's Haimes.
Aha! Who's Haimes?
Colin Haimes, the freestyle killer.
He took out an entire 4x100 meter relay swim team in 1982.
Marco.
[Cocks gun]
Now you say ""polo,"" punk.
The freestyle killer.
Man! How come all the killers you've caught had such cool names?
The best name I ever brought in was ""narrow shoes"" Sam, because... his shoes were narrow and his name was Sam.
I get it. Yeah, you get it.
Well, Captain, it looks like you needed our help after all.
Together, we figured out it was Haimes, and together, we're gonna take him down.
Because together, we can do anything.
Here we go!
I'm finding Haimes alone.
Coming back at you, Jake!
Oh, my God, Rosa!
I accidentally opened your mail, but look what it says.
""Dear miss Diaz, you just won...""
Rosa, guess what.
I accidentally opened your mail, and here's what it says.
""Dear miss Diaz, you just won...""
No, I'm reading the letter, and you're taking the picture.
What?
Ha!
You were trying to get me to smile for your dumb picture, but you messed up.
Ah! She smiled. She's smiling!
And no one has a camera. [Sighs]
[Camera clicks] Got it, Amy.
Got a picture of you frowning.
That's what you wanted, right?
[Horn honking]
Peralta, for the last time we don't have to go back to the precinct.
I don't need everyone's help.
Look, Captain, you're stubborn.
And that's an adorable quality.
You wanna know what's not an adorable quality?
Being dead. Acne.
Yep, being dead.
I mean, I give up.
What's going on with you?
Why are you being so weird about this?
I don't need your help.
I don't wanna involve you, or Boyle, or anyone.
Because I brought this situation on myself.
No one should get hurt because of a dumb mistake I made as a brash, young Detective.
Hey, Haimes.
You're gonna spend the rest of your life in a little cement room, doing nothing.
And while you're in there, I'm gonna go for a swim.
And after that swim, I might take another swim.
And you'll just be sitting there on your metal toilet, thinking of me swim, swim, swimming all day long.
When I get out of lockup, I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.
Yeah. [Laughs]
Right.
Wow.
I think I really would've gotten along with young Ray Holt.
Yes, that's why I decided to change everything about my life.
Well, frankly, sir, you're still acting like that brash, dumb Detective.
If you had truly changed, you'd be saying a bunch of boring, responsible stuff, like...
""Don't be stupid.
""Use the Detective squad. You're part of a team.
I smell like sandalwood.""
That's what it is!
Yet another terrible impression, Peralta.
But I think you're right.
Wait, what?
Sir, I'm sure you had your reasons for going to Peralta, but...
This is exactly the type of job I would love to have.
Okay, the next time someone threatens to kill me, I'll come straight to you.
Thank you, sir.
I can't wait.
I... didn't mean...
Let's catch this b*st*rd.
All right, let's go! Updates. Santiago.
Looking into Haimes' associates. Nothing yet.
Boyle?
Uh, some intel coming in from ossining.
Haimes was released two weeks ago.
Good. Hitchcock and Scully, update on your secret project?
Hazelnut coffee'll be up in five minutes.
Sumatran's ready to go.
Keep me updated.
Warrant for the phone trace came through.
We got Haimes' number...
And the last coordinates from its GPS.
The rail yards.
All right, we got him. Everyone suit up!
I know there's no point in telling you not to come, but while we're out there, you're sticking with me.
Oh. Goodie.
Man, you really know how to take the fun out of saving your life.
You heard him, Hitchcock.
Get that Sumatran in the thermos.
I'm on it.
[Train whistle blares]
If things go south, I just want you to know it's been an honor being able to boss you around.
Anything else?
Yes. What cute little nickname do you call your husband?
Kevin.
Adorable.
Rosa: Sorry you missed your flight.
I have a backup flight in four hours.
Gotta flush him out.
We got his number now. Call his phone.
Smart.
[Line trilling] It's ringing.
This is exciting.
[Melodic ringtone]
That is Haimes' phone.
I repeat, everyone converge on that ringtone.
He's heading north on track 17!
Hey.
When this is all over, we should take a train trip together.
Just for fun.
[Gunshots]
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ray Holt!
Hello, Haimes.
Thought about you every day I was in jail just like you said.
I thought about pointing a gun at you and pulling the trigger.
Kinda like this. Noooo!
[Terry grunting]
Terry's back!
Terry's back!
We got him.
Nice work, Jeffords.
Nice work, Peralta.
Captain, you're doing it.
You're emoting.
[Laughs]
Rosa on radio: I need an ambulance. Boyle's down.
Ah, what happened? Am I dead?
You saved my life.
Die, pig!
Charles: Don't!
Ahhh!
[Grunts]
Oh, my butt!
Oh, my butt.
He's gonna be fine. You can see him in a minute.
[Sighs] Thank you.
Sarge, I'm so glad that shrink cleared you.
Mm, more or less.
And time's up.
Show me how Terry sees Terry.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it's pretty bad. [Door opens]
Sergeant! Excuse me, we are...
Yeah, can it, quack.
Captain Holt needs your help. His life is in danger.
Therapist: Oh, sergeant...
I do not think that you're ready.
I'm ready.
Mm-kay, bye!
I owe you one.
Boyle got shot because of me.
This is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping to avoid.
Captain, this is our job.
Any one of us would've taken that bullet.
I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
You were right.
We couldn't have caught him without the team.
Well, well, well.
It appears the student has become the teacher.
And the teacher hath become... That's enough.
Okay.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Team pop and lock. Here we go!
Whoosh!
Come on, still? We saved your life!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's happening! Whoa, whoa!
Yes! We did it!
[Laughter]
Excuse me!
This is a hospital.
Jake: Right. Sorry.
People are dying.
You know, everyone should just go home and enjoy their Christmas.
You don't need to stick around here for me.
Shut up, no one's going anywhere.
What you did was amazing.
Yeah, Boyle, that was some superman stuff.
Yeah, you did the nine-nine proud.
No ifs, ands, or butts.
Sorry, it's just right there. Literally.
It's just right in front of me. His butt is right in my face.
I have to tell you guys something.
Even though I got shot...
In the butt. Sorry.
Charles: I'd rather be here, spending Christmas with all of you, than on some stupid singles cruise.
And I mean that, from the bottom of my...
Butt. Again, sorry.
Ow! Shut up, Jake!
Boyle's a hero.
And so is his butt.
[Camera clicks]
I got it! She smiled!
Christmas card complete.
He got shot in the butt.

He's here. Boyle is here.
This is so fun!
I wish you guys got shot more often.
Buh-buh-buh-back in the nine nine.
[Cheers and applause]
Welcome back, Detective.
Wow, is this all for me?
Jake: Of course it is.
What're you wearing, there, buddy?
Oh, none of my pants fit over my butt cast.
Lucky for me my lent me her leg warmers.
That is lucky.
Pretty sweet scooter.
Yeah, I know. Check out these doughnuts.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, that went terribly. Can I help you with something?
Nope, nope. Everything's under control.
I picked up a couple reacher grabbers.
Yeah.
So I'm able to do everything that I used to do.
So now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a morning cup of coffee like I do every day.
Okay, okay.
Just gotta... No problem.
[Mug shatters]
[People ooh]
Oh... The heart is the hardest part.
[People oh]
Let me get that for you, Boyle.
No need. No need at all.
That's sweet, Rosa. Here we go.
Terry: Ah...
Hey, Charles, just take my coffee. It's fresh.
Okay, I guess. I mean, if you don't mind.
All right, you got it? Ah... [Chuckles]
No problem.
Why wouldn't you just use your other hand?
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Hot coffee in my cast!
Ah! [Gasps]
Ah... [Sighs]
Cold milk.
Cold milk.
That's coming out the bottom.
It is coming out the bottom of my cast.
[People groan]
Gina: All right.
♪
Hey.
What's going on?
Just picked him up on a dozen counts of identity theft.
His name is Doug Judy.
You ever seen him before? No.
[Rolling rs]
♪ Rosa ♪
♪ Rosa, Rosa ♪
♪ Oh, yeah ♪
♪ Beautiful Rosa ♪
I think he's into me.
What do you do to these perps?
Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac.
Anyway, he said he wants to speak to ""John or Jack Peralta or whatever.""
What does he want with me?
And should I change my name to Jack Peralta?
That sounds badass.
[Dramatic voice] Jack Peralta, crocodile hunter.
Yeah.
He said he wants a deal.
He has some information about some dude who steals Pontiacs.
Pontiacs? He knows about the Pontiac bandit.
Listen to me, he specifically said he knows a guy who steals Pontiacs?
Yeah, I just said that. Chill, man.
Okay.
Okay, sorry.
M'kay. [Laughs]
Doug: Hey, Diaz.
Come here and talk to me.
This dude is super horny.
Yeah.
Ah. Whoa.
[Scooter beeping]
[Beeping]
Backing up, guys.
Oh, are you? Huh.
Scooter's computer voice: Please get out of my way. I am physically disabled.
One of these buttons... [Horn honking]
Sorry, sorry.
Oh, you don't have to apologize for anything, Boyle.
You were shot in the line of duty, defending a fellow officer.
You know, the doctor said that if the bullet was two millimeters to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again.
Everyone here appreciates your heroism, Boyle.
We all want your first day back to be as pleasant and as comfortable as possible.
Right, detectives?
Absolutely.
Hey, Boyle. You want to choose where we order lunch from today?
Really? You're lifting the lifetime ban?
I thought my lunch choices were ""horrifying adventures in diarrhea.""
Today, Charles, we take that adventure with you.
Charles: All right!
I've been craving Sudanese all day.
I'll print out some menus.
[Thump] Ouch.
You ran over my foot.
I am in incredible pain.
I used to work at a chop shop.
It was chill. Decent hours, good benefits.
You could work while you were High.
Which I never did, 'cause that's irresponsible.
Anyway, we did a lot of work for this dude who stole Pontiacs.
The Pontiac bandit!
Okay. We called him bill, but whatever.
No, not whatever. The Pontiac bandit is my Nemesis.
I've been chasing this guy for eight years.
He's stolen hundreds of cars, all of them Pontiacs.
He's never left any evidence, and he's never been caught on Cam the guy is a ghost.
Super ghost.
He's a super ghost!
Before we go any further, we need to know if you're for real.
Describe the guy.
Doug: Asian dude.
Maybe 5'8"", spiky black hair.
Rocks in both ears. Always wears a black suit.
And speaks with a British accent.
Like my girl Dame Judi Dench. I have impeccable taste.
So would you say he looks sort of like...
This?
That's bill.
This is a composite sketch from ten interviews I've done.
Perfect match.
So all you know is what a bunch of other mopes have said over the years.
Anything else?
Yeah. I know how to get in touch with him.
Doug Judy!
You wanted to see me, Captain?
My husband's dog cheddar had relations with our neighbor dog karate and produced these two smaller dogs he insisted that I find them a good home with someone we trust.
You can trust me.
Dogs are my whole life.
Also work.
Doing work and hanging with dogs.
That's my lifestyle.
[Sneezes]
[Coughs]
You're allergic to dogs, aren't you? Nope.
I just need an epipen because my happiness is making my throat close up.
Hand me the small dog, Santiago.
[Sneezing]
So the burner phone that Doug Judy used to contact the Pontiac bandit is at his mom's house.
He's agreed to help us catch the bandit if we drop all charges against him.
How many cars would you say this Pontiac bandit has stolen?
230 that I know of.
But the real number could be in the millions.
You're not very good at math.
What are the charges against Judy?
12 counts of identity theft, but I've been chasing him for a month.
Oh, a month?
I've been trying to catch the Pontiac bandit for eight years.
You know how many months that is?
96.
80... 40... and 6 years, months.
Do you need a math tutor?
Because the department will provide one for you.
I can't tell if you're being serious.
I'm on the fence here.
Diaz caught him.
It's your call.
Look, this guy is for real. 1,000 push-ups.
1,000 push-ups, really? Yes.
Okay. I'm in.
Holt: What's 1,000 push-ups?
Oh, we were in the academy together, and we hated all the drills, so now when we're on a case and one of us says 1,000 push-ups, it means I'm so sure I'm right that if I'm wrong, I'll do 1,000 push-ups.
Rosa: It's a pact we made.
It really just means ""trust me."" And I do.
Holt: Okay.
Make the deal. Yes!
I've got you now, Pontiac bandit. Whoo!
Feels good to finally say that in front of actual people instead of just the mirror.
All right, so we grab the burner, catch the bandit, become police legends.
My mom's car is here. She's home.
Can I take these cuffs off?
No way.
She doesn't know I'm a criminal.
She thinks I own an architecture firm with all white employees.
That's racist.
Why stop there? Why not tell her you're an astronaut?
'Cause space is scary.
You saw what it did to Sandy bullock.
Yeah, I'm with him on this one.
I'll stay on earth, thank you very much.
Yeah. [Laughs]
Come on, Rosa.
We can play-act with his mom for two minutes to get a lead.
Fine.
One false move, and I tase you in front of your mom.
Dougie! Oh, my beautiful boy.
[Smooches]
Well, shouldn't you be at work?
Never too busy to see my mama. Oh.
Mama, this is my girlfriend Rosa.
And this is my personal assistant.
Mangy Carl.
Aw, it's nice to meet you. You can just call me Carl.
Mangy Carl used to be a homeless gentleman.
I work with a charity that finds jobs for down-on-their-luck white people.
Oh...
He's just a big, old angel. He's been so good to...
The whites.
[Laughter]
Yes, he is.
Yeah. This guy.
Aw...
[Both laughing]
Hey, speaking of which, we should probably grab that phone, you know, so you can get back to architecturals.
Yes, it's in the spare bedroom.
I'll go with you. It's a mess.
Actually, we can handle it on our own, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
Why don't you just stay up here and...
Chop it up with Rosa?
Well, that sounds nice.
We can get to know each other a little.
I love getting to know people.
It's my jam.
[Slurping]
Oh, how good is this food?
I'm eating it.
They accidentally put a stone in mine.
Oh, no, no, no, no, that's the hoof!
[Gasps] That's the best part of the stew!
Oh, man.
Think of it as marrow nugget wrapped in a thick toenail.
[Gags]
Charles: [Slurps] Mmm.
Hey, did I tell you guys what the doctor said?
Mm-hmm.
Couple times.
But we'd love to hear it again.
He said that if the bullet was a fraction of an inch to the left and two feet up, it woulda hit my brain.
Oh... Yeah.
[Slurps]
Oh...
""Back in the game. When can we meet?""
Damn, you're a good assistant. I could get used to this.
How long till he usually gets back to you?
Like ten minutes. Chill, mangy.
I can't chill. I've never been this close before.
I gotta admit, your enthusiasm makes me want you to catch him.
Thank you.
Are these laserdiscs?
Yeah, I robbed a tower records back in '92.
Kept my faves.
Doug Judy. Ooh.
Blade runner, tron, oh!
Fievel goes west?
Yes, sir. Love that little mouse.
His journey... The story of America.
I could not agree more.
Fievel? Papa.
Fievel! Papa!
Fie-vel! Pa-PA!
Fie-vel!
You guys having fun?
Hey. 'Cause I'm not.
His mom put this stupid braid in my hair.
Oh, looks beautiful.
Yeah, it's kinda cute.
Please have my children.
[Phone chimes]
It's him.
Parking lot on Flatbush and Vanderbilt in 15 minutes.
Let's go.
Doug: Wait, wait, wait.
Diaz looks like a dirty criminal.
But you look like a cop, man.
You can't go over there like that.
What'd you have in mind?
♪ Don't call it a comeback ♪
♪ I been here for years ♪
♪ Rockin' my peers and puttin' suckas in fear ♪
♪ Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon ♪
♪ Listen to the bass go boom ♪
♪ Explosion overpowerin' ♪
♪ Over the competition I'm towerin' ♪
I don't look like a cop now.
No, you look like a Boyz II Men Easter album.
Burn.
That's not a burn, that's cool.



[Door opens]
Gina, we've been looking all over for you.
You can't just disappear and leave a sign on your desk that says, ""gone leavin'.""
Gina: I'm hiding from Charles.
I can't take him anymore.
It's safe in here
'cause his scooter can't get up the steps in the hallway.
Gina, have some compassion.
Boyle got hurt doing something brave.
You didn't have to do physical therapy with him, Amy.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push.
All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong.
Like you use performance-enhancing drugs and have one teste?
Wouldn't you like to know?
How long can you possibly hide in here?
I sent all the Captain's calls here, my phone battery's at 100% charge, and I have ten loose diner mints in my purse.
This is my home now.
I gotta say, the suit is growing on me.
Looks good.
Is it triple-breasted somehow?
There's no such thing.
What about the girl in total recall?
Mmm. Triple bitties.
Triple bitties. Triple bitties. Yeah.
[Laughs] Rosa...
There's no sign of anyone.
You sure about this?
1,000 push-ups.
Okay.
Heads up.
Who the hell are you? Where's bill?
He hadn't heard from you in a while, so he sent me to make sure everything was cool.
Apparently it's not.
Who are they?
They're with me.
This is the buyer. Carl Mangerman. 'Sup?
I don't know them, I don't trust them.
He meets with you alone or it's off.
I'll text the address.
Come on!
I promise you this.
They have not heard the last of Carl mangerman.
Sergeant, I'd like you to meet Richard and Dan.
They are puppies.
Very cute, sir.
Maybe your twins would like some little, furry friends.
I'm sorry, sir, but that's impossible.
With the twins learning how to walk, chaos reigns at the Jeffords household.
I can't let those innocent pups into that madhouse.
Terry won't do you like that.
Holt: I understand.
Just know you have disappointed...
All three of us.
That's cold, sir.
All right, it's worth the risk.
We send him in alone.
No, we do not. Something doesn't smell right to me.
Could be my dad's suit. He died in it.
He died in it?
Oh, man. [Phone chimes]
They just sent the location.
Doug: Man, this dude is cautious.
If I show up one minute late or I'm not alone, he's done with me.
This is your last shot.
I can't let the Pontiac bandit get away.
Put a wire on him, get a tactical team in as backup.
It's the only way.
Doug Judy and I know this guy. You have to trust us.
Do I?
One of you is a criminal, and the other one is dressed like Steve Harvey.
It's over. I'm ending this now.
Sorry, Jake.
Seriously?
Yeah. 1,000 push-ups.
Well, I raise you. 2,000 push-ups.
What? That's not how this works.
I said 1,000 push-ups, you have to back me up.
That's the pact, end of story.
Well, I break the pact.
I hope you understand how serious this is to me.
Come on, Rosa.
Can't you read between the lines, man?
Don't quote die hard.
Sorry.
But we're still sending him in alone.
Jake: We need evidence, so get him talking.
Ask questions about money, cars, specifics.
I'm getting kind of nervous, man. This dude is for real.
You sure you got everything covered?
Yeah.
There's a body on the back door, eyes on the side door, and two guys out on the corner. You're gonna be fine.
What about choppers?
You got choppers? With snipers and rockets?
No one has rocket choppers.
Although that does sound amazing.
So, what'd I miss?
Tell me all the jokes. Everything funny that happened.
Charles, we really need to get back to...
Hitchcock called himself Scully by accident.
I did. But it brought me and Scully closer together.
Charles: [Laughs] That's great!
What else?
Oh...
Oh, I laughed too hard. Lost another highlighter.
Does anyone have skinny forearms?
Fine.
Great.
Yeah, it's way down there by my butt.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Is that it? Yup.
Oh, okay.
Charles: Right there.
Ah!
Got it.
Oh, my God. Where's my grandmother's ring?
Oop. Found it.
I'll be right back.
Scooter's computer voice: Please get out of my way. I am physically disabled.
[Beeping] Please get out of my way.
Welcome to the Boyle-free zone.
Please turn off all cell phones so as not to attract any unwanted attention.
Can I offer you a mint?
Rosa: We got eyes on the bandit. He's a block away.
You ready?
You and me, Jakey. We were born ready.
Go, Judy, go.
[Shutter clicking]
Jake: We meet at last, Pontiac bandit.
For eight years I've tracked you.
And today I'm taking you down.
Doug Judy, can you hear me?
Say something to test the wire.
Doug: Hey, Diaz...
After we put the cuffs on this guy, I'll be free for dinner.
You like spaghetti?
And weed?
The mic works.
My man. What's up?
Man: Pleasure to see you again.
Doug: Let's talk about cars.
I got my shop up and running again.
I can do anything you want.
Blue cars, red cars, big cars, small cars, you know, cars. Cars are really great, aren't they?
What is he doing?
Talking about cars.
Boyle, where is everyone?
Hiding from me in the evidence room.
They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing.
She live tweets everything.
Ruined Downton Abbey for me.
Maybe it was too soon for me to come back.
I would've just stayed at home, but I was getting lonely and bored.
One day I looked out the window for four hours.
I didn't see anything.
Huh.
Doug: You know what else is great about cars?
The way they look. How they stop, how they start.
That's it. I'm calling it.
No!
Move, people, we're going in now.
On your knees! Hands on your head!
Gotcha, Pontiac bandit.
Where's Doug Judy?
He went to the bathroom.
I'm just here to give him a haircut.
I don't know what's going on.
A likely story, Pontiac...
But actually you do have a lot of hair products.
He's gone. He ran.
Why would he do that?
He helped us catch the Pontiac bandit. That was the deal.
Doesn't make any sense unless...
Doug Judy is the Pontiac bandit.
[Siren whoops]
Put out an APB.
Seal off everything for a 20-block radius.
Doug: Yeah, don't bother looking for me.
I'm in the wind. [Blowing]
Jake: If you're close enough for me to hear you, you're close enough for me to catch you.
Nah, I got a relay set up, brother.
So if you're the Pontiac bandit, who's this joker?
Doug: Couple of years ago you were getting really close, so I started telling all my associates if they ever get caught, they should describe me as...
Asian dude, 5'8"", spiky hair.
Wears diamond earrings and has a...
British accent.
So then you hired a guy who matched that exact description.
Doug: No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's my barber Norman Lee. He gave me the idea.
You know, if you can't come in, I do house calls.
You just text me a location and I could be there in half an hour.
Good to know.
You know, you should actually use him while he's there.
He'll give you a dope fade.
I get dope enough fades from my current barber, thank you.
So you dragged us over here, went in there, pretended to talk, and then snuck out the basement.
Am I right?
Doug: The basement connected to another basement!
Which connected to a garage, which is where my boy picked me up.
Your boy?
Oh, that guy from the meet-up.
He works for you.
He pretended to be spooked by me and Diaz in the parking lot to make sure that we let you go to the next meeting by yourself.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
You win a Teddy bear!
You lied to me, Doug Judy.
Gotta be honest, I'm pretty disappointed right now.
I mean, was that even really your mom?
Doug: Hell yeah, that's my real mom.
I wanted to see her one last time before I disappeared.
I told you I was sensitive, Rosa.
Rosa: Yeah, you did.
Why don't you come back here and take me out to dinner?
Ah... [Laughs]
I know you're trying to trap me.
But crazy thing is I'm tempted!
That's how hot I find you.
Sorry it had to go down this way, Peralta.
Maybe we could've been friends in another world.
If I hadn't just fooled you like a little bitch!
[Engine revs]
[Laughing] Bitch!
'Kay.
Hey, Captain, we thought we'd get more work done in here, because...
You're all hiding from Boyle.
Hitchcock: Not me, Captain.
I was napping.
That's worse.
Amy: Captain, we all think Boyle's a hero, but it's very difficult to be around him right now.
Terry: I was in the bathroom with him, sir.
It was a nightmare.
Hey, sarge, this cast has a special crotch hole.
It's like a doggy door for my pen1s.
Shake.
That man took a bullet for this precinct.
He's a guy who's always looking for love and friendship.
And he needs it now more than ever.
But you all turned your backs on him.
And you should all be ashamed of yourselves.
Gina: [Giggles]
I'm sorry. Those puppies are so cute.
They do undercut your Tone a bit, sir.
Terry: But on the plus side,
I think I know what to do with them.
Holt: Detective Boyle.
I think you might be able to give these dogs a good home.
Ah...
Scooter's computer voice: You are off the scooter.
If you have fallen, please call a doctor.
Oh, Captain...
I don't know if I should... okay.
Oh... [Laughs]
That tickles.
They like me so much! [Gasps]
[Exhales]
Are you crying, Santiago?
I'm so allergic.
Can you tell the scooter to call an ambulance?
[Gasps]
Hey.
So...
I went back to the mom's house.
Unsurprisingly a dead end.
I got a lot of work to do, Peralta.
Wait.
I want to say something.
We've worked together long enough that I know how much you hate apologies.
I just want to ask you to join the Doug Judy case.
Officially, as partners.
I want to catch this guy, and I can't do it without you.
No, you can't.
Now I believe I owe you 1,000 push-ups.
I don't care about the push-ups, Jake.
I care that you didn't honor our pact.
I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.
I know, and I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
No, it won't.
Now get down on the floor.
What? You just said you didn't care about the push-ups.
I changed my mind.
Fair enough.
A pact's a pact.
[Groans]
One, two, three...
612...
Night, Peralta.
Night.
613...
Hey, Ronald.
[Groans]
1,000...
Is so many push-ups. I'm never gonna make it.
What am I at?
901.
Thank you, Captain.
You said 2,000, remember?
Agh!
I shoulda trusted you! [Sobbing]

Jake: Charles, this is exciting.
Medal of valor.
I know.
For getting shot in the butt.
[Gunfire]
Oh, my butt!
For exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety.
But, you know, six of one.
This is one of the NYPD's highest honors.
Today is your day, Detective Boyle.
Gerber: Heroism can't be measured by a piece of metal.
But what else can we do to recognize the brave officers that have put their lives on the line?
It is my great honor to present the medal of valor to Detective Charles Boyle...
And sergeant peanut butter.
[Riotous cheers and applause]
[Horse neighs]
Oh, my God.
Charles is getting the same medal as a horse.
At least Boyle was announced first.
Because the horse outranks him.
This is amazing.
That's enough, Peralta.
Holt: This is a huge honor, and nothing can take that away from him.
The horse is pooping on the stage.
Sergeant peanut butter is pooping on the stage.
[Snorts]
♪
Peralta.
Santiago.
The bet ends today.
Are you ready? I was born ready.
To lose? The whole question was, ""are you ready to lose?""
And you said you were born that way.
Twist my words all you want.
Okay. I'm winning this bet.
No.
Hitchcock: What bet?
What are you guys talking about?
Seriously? The bet?
They've been keeping score all year.
It comes up all the time.
What are you doing all day?
Nothing. Why, you wanna hang out?
A year ago today, Peralta and I made a bet to prove who's a better Detective.
Whoever makes more felony arrests, wins.
What are the stakes?
And don't say money, because I know you're in debt.
If you really knew anything about me, you would've said ""crushing debt,"" and I'll bet whatever, 'cause there's no way I'm losing.
What about your car? Oh!
That thing is a date magnet.
I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car?
Six? Well, I'm gonna win, so sure.
Let's bet the car. [Crowd oohs]
Yes.
No, Jakey, no!
That car is your superpower.
Thor would never wager his hammer.
Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship.
Losing that car will be the worst thing in the world for you.
Well, what's the worst thing in the world for you, Santiago?
Being one of those girls in Jake's car.
Terry: Okay, okay, okay.
Then it is settled.
If Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car.
If Santiago loses, she goes for a date in said car.
Game on.
Game on.
Wow, your handshake is quite firm.
I took a seminar.
Where?
And the score is all tied up.
But not for long.
For in eight hours, I will win the bet and take Santiago on the worst date in the history of the world.
Holt: Attention.
After today's shift, I'd like everyone join me at the bar for drinks in honor of Detective Boyle and his medal of valor.
Oh, my God, is peanut butter gonna be there?
That horse is a damn hero.
Peanut butter will not be joining us.
He's being feted by the united nations.
As you were.
Pen. You... ow!
Rolly chair!
Gina's desk! Oh, Jake.
No!
Captain, hey.
You're looking stoic today, like a wise old oak.
I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.
What? Oh, right, the bet.
[Chuckles] Totally forgot about that.
Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week.
Up by one, Peralta.
Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again? Hmm?
Hey, Santiago, do you have any dietary restrictions that medieval times should know about?
Yes, 3-1-1?
What's the safest way to set a car on fire?
Ooh. Hmm!
Both of you have done exemplary work, which I appreciate.
And I can see that by the absolutely no indicators on your face.
However, you are colleagues, and the fallout from this bet has the potential to put a strain on your professional relationship.
Only if I lose.
I'm a terrible sport.
Cases will be assigned as they usually are.
Dismissed.
Captain, you look... No.
Rosa, hey, would you like to share a cup of coffee with me?
I got some gorgeous new coffee beans.
Sure, that sounds great.
Isn't that, like, your fifth cup of coffee today?
I'm trying to counteract the drowsiness from my pain meds.
I took a double dose after the incident at the ceremony.
Photographer: Bring peanut butter forward... forward.
Uh, can the little guy take a big step back, please?
My name is Charles Boyle.
I won the same medal as this horse.
[Screams]
The footage from my fall led the local news, so who's the hero now, peanut butter?
Peanut butter.
Gina, you're just trying to hurt me to distract yourself from your own internal pain.
Also, you should use less conditioner, because this is a flat mess.
Holt: What's going on with Boyle?
His pain meds are making him weird.
Oh, okay. Yes.
This happened to my dad when he got his vasectomy un-reversed.
You get all relaxed and you have no filter and you just start dropping truth bombs on everyone.
Oh, that explains the elevator.
I'm worried you don't find me interesting.
I'm gonna pretend someone texted me.
Bloop.
[Chuckles]
Gina, please keep an eye on Boyle today.
He's gonna say something to the wrong person and get himself punched.
Sure, I'd love to see Charles get punched.
Try again?
I will stop Charles from getting punched.
Correct.
Great.
[Exhales]
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present Carl Laudson, who stole $3,000.
Santiago takes the lead with one minute left.
Suck it, Peralta.
[Bemused] Oh, no.
That's right, ""oh, no.""
Oh, no. You don't seem worried.
Why aren't you worried?
Bring in the Johns.
I ran a prostitution sting through vice and arrested 30 guys for soliciting.
That's not a felony.
It is when it's your second offense, which is the case for ten of these gentlemen.
Fun fact: Four of them are actually named John.
Ironic.
Anyhoo, ten more for Peralta.
Accept your fate.
Never.
Five, four, three, two, one. No.
Jake wins, Amy loses.

Amy Santiago, you have made me the happiest man on earth.
I spent $1 on this ring.
Will you go on the worst date ever with me?
You have to say yes.
Yes.
[Cheers and applause] She said yes!
She said yes.
This is for you.
[Horn honks]
Amy Santiago, date time.
Time to date.
Peralta, this outfit is ridiculous.
Chop chop.
There's plenty of embarrassing to do and only a few hours to do it in.
Happy?
Oh, yeah.
You look like every girl at every bat mitzvah I ever had a crush on.
Let's see the bow. [Chuckles]
Just like Jenny Gildenhorn.
Why do I wish you had braces?
Should we get you braces?
No, that's too much.
Here I come.
Nice shorts.
Thank you. Believe it or not, they were not very expensive.
Do I really have to wear this all night?
You know the rules.
The date starts now and ends at midnight.
I decide what you wear, what you eat, and where we go.
Oh, and there is one more rule.
No matter what happens, you're not allowed to fall in love with me.
Won't be a problem.
Detective Boyle, I just wanted to say congratulations.
Your medal was well-deserved.
Thank you, sir.
Your breath is terrible.
Charles, can I speak with you?
Hey, where's Rosa?
I haven't seen her all night.
Did you know my wife pays me alimony?
Okay, let's take a seat.
I'm gonna keep an eye on you all night, little buddy.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby. Happy you made it.
Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sharon.
It's so wonderful to meet you.
I've heard such great things about you.
And you.
Your husband is a real hero.
If you ask me, he should've been up there with Detective Boyle today.
What for?
For saving my life.
He means metaphorically.
You know, saving him from all that paperwork.
Paper cuts are a slow death, baby.
No, I was referring to how he threw his body at an emotionally disturbed criminal who was trying to kill me.
Nooo!
He did what?
Are you back in the field?
Oh. I have caused a problem.
I think I am...
Getting a text message.
Bloop.
Ah. There it is.
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?
I thought I told you.
Remember when you were half asleep watching the news and the babies were quiet, and I said, real low, ""hey, baby.
I'm back in the field. You want something to eat?""
And you were like, ""what?""
And I was like, ""you want something to eat?""
And you said, ""sure.""
And I got you an oatmeal cookie?
Remember?
You are a piece of work, Terrance.
Oh, damn. She called me Terrance.
I'm doomed.
[Bullhorn blares]
Jake: Hot date coming through.
Hey, attention, everyone.
Now I know that tonight is Boyle's big night.
[Cheering]
But let's forget about that completely for a moment and admire and comment on every terrible aspect of this.
[Cheers and applause]
Permission to go to the bathroom?
Granted. First of three.
Use them wisely.
Hey.
Congrats again, buddy.
I really am proud of you.
Still wearing the medal, huh?
Yes, I want women to be impressed by me.
All right.
Well, I'm sorry that I can't stay, but I have a terrible night planned for Amy.
First up is the mall photo studio, where we'll take our official date portrait.
The picture will be the two of us playing one saxophone.
Then some peel-and-eat shrimp for dinner at a dangerously cheap seafood restaurant.
And then I've contracted a youth choir to serenade us.
[All singing]
♪ Santiago Santiago ♪
♪ Santiago
♪ Santiago ♪
♪ You suck so bad Yes!
They'll sing to her at midnight the middle of Times Square.
She and 500 German tourists will savor that memory for all times.
Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls' pigtails on playgrounds?
'Cause they're so easy to grab.
They're just begging to be pulled.
Because they like the girls, and that's the only way they know how to get their attention.
What are you saying?
All of this teasing, this elaborate date, somewhere down deep, you like Amy.
Like, ""like her,"" like her.
Okay, that's straight-up insanity.
How much did you spend on tonight?
$1,400, but all of it's on credit cards, so it's, like, $5 a month for the next 2,000 years.
I do not like Amy!
You're putting a lot of effort into a joke.
Why don't you sit down and have a real conversation with her?
Okay, Boyle, you live in your ex-wife's new boyfriend's basement.
I'm not taking advice from you.
Hup.
I'm ashamed of my living situation.
Rosa, why are you sequestered over by this old cell phone?
I'm avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.
I sometimes worry I'm gonna become you.
He keeps saying he wants to talk to me.
I'm afraid he's gonna tell me he loves me or propose marriage or something.
Oh, my God.
That makes me kind of want to cry.
He dove in front of those bullets for me.
I can't be mean to him.
I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning.
But I also can't lead him on.
Captain Holt told me not to let him get hurt tonight.
So I'll keep him away from you.
Have you seen Rosa?
Rosa died eight years ago.
Come on. Let's get you a drink.
Jake: Excuse me, everyone.
Santiago and I will be performing the steerage jig from the film Titanic, which we have prepared for in no way, shape, or form.
Romantic.
No, embarrassing.
Milady.

[Cheers and applause]
You look pretty. I hate your guts.
Channel that passion into the dance.
Peralta. Scully, tag in.
Okay. Keep spinning.
Yes. One of our informants just called.
We've been tracking a crew that lifts cargo out of Laguardia.
The C.I. knows where the trucks unload, so I need you to stake out the drop site.
Oh, sir, I'm right in the middle of this date and I cannot reschedule.
I have far, far too many non-refundable deposits.
I'm renting a tiger cub by the hour.
For what? Don't even know.

Oh, thank God.
Gina, tag in?
No, not even if it would cure cancer.
Okay.
Look, baby, I'm sorry, but Captain's life was in danger.
I just did what I had to do.
It was an impulse decision.
Well, I guess I can understand that.
Holt: Sharon.
I have to apologize.
I want to assure you that the call to put sergeant Jeffords back in the field wasn't a spur-of-the-moment, impulse decision.
It's been in the works for a few months now.
Terry said it just happened.
I think you two need to get your stories straight.
Perhaps I should stop talking to your wife.
That's a good call. Captain.
Sharon.
Amy: I'm so happy to be out of that dress.
It was weirdly hot.
Oh, yeah, it's probably because it was a cotton and plastic blend.
But not to worry.
We're gonna catch these guys and get back to the worst date of your life.
No.
Nothing will ever be worse than the date I had with my aunt's dentist.
You should try some of this.
Okay.
Oh. Okay. Hold on. Hmm?
Yeah, dessert is out of the question.
[Laughs]
What was your worst date ever?
I think it's, like, a 50-way tie.
The last lady I went out with burst into tears when I told her I was a Gemini.
Wow.
Hey, those people left that door open.
I bet there's a better vantage point from the roof.
Mmm, and I bet it doesn't smell like old cheese.
Okay, that's hurtful.
Shall we? Yeah.
So what else don't I know?
You cooking meth?
You breaking bad?
How many phones do you have?
I'm sorry, I need to clarify something I said earlier.
Sergeant Jeffords was correct when he said that his choice to go back in the field that night was an impulse decision.
He didn't even take the time to stop and gear up, so...
Sharon: What? So...
You didn't have your vest on?
Oh, no. Oh, goodness.
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel I may have made things worse.
Wait. I can fix this, Ray.
Now is not the time, Boyle. Hush!
I want to hear this.
Boyle, let's not make big... Hush.
Truth time.
We love your husband.
He's a great cop.
We will do anything to protect him.
And you have incredibly attractive hands.
And you, what the hell are you doing, lying to your wife?
Unless you want to end up moving into my ex-wife's new boyfriend's basement with me, you better man up.
Don't you ever keep anything from this beautiful woman again.
Seriously, you are beautiful.
Oh. If he ever lies to you again, you can call me.
I'm sorry, honey.
I just didn't want you to worry.
Baby, I am always gonna worry about you.
But if you feel like you're ready, then get your ass back in the field.
But if you ever keep anything from me again, I will leave you for this short, earnest man and his ex-wife's new boyfriend's apartment.
I know you're kidding, but Hercules is actually a very good landlord.
Sometimes, when they go on nice vacations, I'm allowed to use the hot tub.

They're in my stakeout bag.
Your stakeout bag is 98% nuts.
I get snacky.
Besides, nuts are super healthy.
They're, like, 0% fat.
Jake, that's not true at all.
It's actually the opposite.
What? That nut vendor lied to me.
I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.
Yeah.
The windows don't exactly roll up.
The car's a piece of crap.
Why do you love it so much?
You really want to know?
I was two days out of the academy, super nervous.
Saw this guy run out of a bodega, clutching a bunch of cash.
So I pursued him on foot, 11 blocks.
Finally catch him, cuff him, throw him up against that car.
Turned out there was a for sale sign in the window, and, it being the best day of my life, I bought it.
Thus began the debt.
Crushing debt.
Yeah, you do know me.
Nut?
Only if you throw it.
Ready? Ready?
Mm-hmm. Nice.
You ready? Uh-huh.

Just checking in.
How you doing? Any progress?
Yep. Watch.

If you'd won the bet, were you really gonna destroy my car?
No. I was gonna drive it.
So I could learn stick.
You wouldn't.
I would. Would've been, like, [screeching noise]
No. No!
Hey, hey!

I was gonna propose to you.

Brooklyn bridge?
We met on the Manhattan bridge.
You know what? This is over.
Say good-bye to the ring and everything it represents.

Hey, hey. Stop yelling hey, no one talks to Susan like that.
And you know what else? On the ground! NYPD! NYPD!

Nice work.
You too.
I'm sad y'all are arresting me, but I gotta say, I'm glad you're back together.
Hey. I need to talk to you.
Oh. It's happening?
Remember when I took those bullets for you?
Okay, let's do this.
I think you're sweet...
I didn't know it was you.
When I jumped in front of those bullets, I didn't know who I was protecting.
I just saw a gun and an NYPD vest, and so I dove on instinct.
You've been extra nice to me because you thought I'd risked my life for you.
But I only did what every good cop would do.
When you finally go out with me, and you will, it'll be because I do things that only Charles Boyle would do.
Um, actually, I have a coat in here.
It's, uh... it's, like... actually, I see it.
It's, like... it's blue... it's, like, right...
Excellent job on the stakeout last night.
I'm glad to see you two still work well together despite that ridiculous bet.
Thanks. Me too.
And I appreciate your turning down the relief team.
I'm not sure they could've made that bust.
Yeah. Right.

So... sorry you lost so much money last night.

Nah, it still goes on the good date list.

Morning, Scully. How was your weekend?
Oh, fun. Kelly and I hit the park, went for a long walk.
Fell asleep watching TV.
Oh. Sounds like a fun weekend with Kelly.
So, Kelly. Is that Scully's wife or his dog?
Uh... Wait.
No one knows Scully's wife's name?
I think Kelly is his dog.
Went for a long walk. That's what you do with a dog.
You can go on a long walk with a person.
At sunset.

Sounds awful. Hit the park. That's a dog.
My wife takes the babies to the park all the time.
All right, we're doing this.

Hey, so Scully, what do you do at the park with Kelly?
Oh, we just walk around.
She gets antsy if she doesn't get outside enough.
And then it's just yap, yap, yap, all day long.
Charles: Hey, what's Kelly's favorite food?
Peanut butter. She'll eat it right out of the jar.
How old is Kelly again?
Well, she's getting up there, but she's pretty spry for her age.
Especially considering she got hit by that car a year ago.
Oh, that's so awful.
Was she chasing something into the street, or...
No. Just getting me the newspaper.

Yup.
Oh, sir, are you looking for your glasses?

Peralta, give me back my glasses.
Okay.
All right, lay out the steroids case.
It's a major operation.
And one of the biggest black market distributors in all of Brooklyn.
And it's centered at a gym called Brooklyn total body.
The center of our investigation is a guy named Brandon jacoby.
He did seven years at Rikers for assault.
[Screams]
We spent two weeks undercover infiltrating the gym.
""Gym-filtrating"" it. I coined that.
I think it'll really catch on if more people infiltrated gyms.
We believe that jacoby can link us to the distributors, but he only talks to trainers and other muscle heads.
So we want to bring in the sarge.
His name will be Trent Carter.
A personal trainer, bouncer, and assistant manager at petsmart.
It's the economy. What can you do?
Gentlemen, have a seat.
Sergeant Jeffords is just getting back in the field.
What if he panics again?
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
I mean, he saved your life at the rail yard.
Okay. It's your case.
But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.
Trust me, the sergeant will be fine.
If you want to worry about anyone panicking in the field it should be Boyle.
Damn straight.
Wait, why'd high five that?
'Cause you're a sucker for a high five.
Damn straight I am.
Captain, I need a favor.
My apartment got broken into last night.
Gina, that's terrible. Are you okay?
I'm fine, but I suffered the loss of many treasured items.
Such as my grandma's jewelry, some cash, and this very fancy gown with, like, a magic eye print.
Do you have any connections in the FBI or CIA?
There's no one else I can turn to to solve this crime.
Gina, you work in a police precinct.
You can turn to anyone here.
You think these buffoons can help?
They're buffoons.
They are not buffoons.
Try the heel.
Still don't feel anything.
Awesome. I wish I had nerve damage.
Some of them are buffoons.
But I'll find the non-buffoons to investigate.
Could you ask Scully to return my thumbtacks?
I already put 'em in a biohazard bag and tossed 'em in the furnace.
Good call.
You ready, sarge?
I was born ready.
And then I was not born ready for a while, but now I'm back to being born ready.
Yes! The ebony falcon soars again.
The ebony falcon.
His feathers are muscles.
Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.
But you're ready for this, right?
Absolutely.
I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.
The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.
Yeah, he does.
Terry Jeffords is back! Chest bump me.
You don't want to do this, man.
No, I really do.
It hurts you every time.
No, I know, but I'm fired up.
The adrenaline is gonna carry me through.
Here we go.
[Grunts]
No signs of forced entry at the door.
But the window was jimmied.
You don't have locks on your windows.
Way to blame the victim.
Sorry I'm not rich like you, miss 1%.
They cost $8. You have a fur bedspread.
Why do you have so many lycra bodysuits?
And why do you need eight full drawers of underwear?
Because I'm civilized.
Less talky-talk, more solvey-solve.
We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.
I already gave it to Captain Holt.
$160 in cash, one TV, one large painting of a naked lady on a lion, one set of Joseph Gordon-levitt nesting dolls...
Wow.
Homemade and irreplaceable.
One music box that plays she works hard for the money when opened.
One knockoff designer clutch...
Can't you just buy another knockoff?
No, I can't, silly sue.
'Cause the label no longer makes the original, so the sweatshop no longer makes the knockoff.
Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?
Emotionally, $700 million.
[Doorbell rings]
Somebody at the door. Yeah.
Jake: Hey, sarge.
Sorry about the mess.
Charles: Hi, Cagney. Hi, Lacey.
Hey, your kids like the same kind of cereal as me.
Well, we just finished story time.
I'm gonna kiss the girls night-night, then we can get down to business.
All right, time for night-night, girls.
He is so strong but so gentle.
He's like an enormous, muscular Ellen Degeneres.
You know, I just want to let you guys know that I love you girls so, so muc okay? So sleep tight.
You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?
Girl: Night-night, daddy.
Gosh. Really makes you understand what he went through.
I'm worried about Terry.
We can't let anything bad happen to him.
Jake, where are you?
In here.
Oh...
This is a classy tepee.
Should we get these instead of desks at work?
We have to get Terry off this case.
What? Why?
Look, I thought he was a weirdo for having his year-long freak-out, but I get it now.
He has children. What happens to them if he gets hurt?
I'll have to take care of them.
Or his wife or other family or his more mature friends, but interesting point.
Why is this just hitting you now?
I don't know, I guess I just hadn't seen his kids in so long he never takes them around the precinct for some reason.
[Gasps] Because of all the guns and danger.
If you have concerns, maybe you should talk to Terry about it.
No. And you can't either.
If he finds out we're worried about him, it'll get in his head and freak him out.
He'll lose his edge and panic.
Yeah, that's why I've never tried to develop an edge.
You can't lose what you don't have.
No surprises.
What are you guys talking about?
Work. International taxes and tariffs.
Work.
Heh.
Terry: So...
What's the plan at the gym?
Well, I say we slow-play it.
You know?
Do a little more setup, a little surveillance, wait a couple months and see if they turn themselves in.
Listen, man, I know everybody's worried about me being psychologically ready for this.
But I promise you I am.
No matter what happens, no matter how many bullets are flying, I'm gonna be right there in the middle of everything.
I got your back.
No, it's not even that, you know, it's just...
Well, frankly, I'm not so sure that everyone at the gym is gonna buy you as a trainer.
You've been sitting behind that desk for so long you've gotten a little tubby.
Right? It's like, love handle alert!
Do you have a bone there somehow?
Jake, I promise. I'm good.
Oops.
I gotta put this stuffed giraffe between my two girls.
They both like to snuggle against his head.
[Tiny, squeaky voice] Here comes Mr. snuggles.
Here comes Mr. snuggles.
Okay, thanks.
Crime tech report from your apartment came back.
Apparently they found a strand of hair belonging to Mario Lopez.
I bought a lock of his hair at an auction.
That's cool it's real.
What'd they say about the prints?
None of the partials returned any matches.
Nobody in your building saw anything. We've hit a wall.
So what do we do next?
Do I just look for another apartment?
Should I buy a handgun?
Should I buy a shotgun?
Should I buy an uzi?
Look, Gina, we've done all we can.
This is how it goes with most B and es.
Mm. All right. [Chuckles]
C'est la vie. Let me grab your badge numbers.
'Cause I will be filing an official civilian complaint with the Captain.
[Both laugh]
[Laughs]
Why did I just receive a civilian complaint about you two?
I can answer this.
Because your assistant is a goblin.
Captain, we swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building. We followed procedure.
""Procedure"" is just a fancy word for proper order to do things.
Yes, that is it's definition.
This is a miscarriage of justice.
I'm gonna haunt your dreams.
[Gina chuckles]
You sure you can lift this much weight?
Are you kidding me?
I was the strongest kid in my camp seven summers in a row.
It would've been eight if that freak Rebecca Lobelman hadn't showed up.
Let's put in work.
And here we go.
One.
And I'm done. That's it.
Oh, good rep. Don't wanna get too bulky.
[Sighs] Two things.
First, this gym's wipe-down policy is criminally lax.
So I rewrote it.
Second, I lowered the temperature of the water fountain by two degrees.
Still waiting on feedback, but I see a lot of refreshed faces.
Also Brandon jacoby should be here soon.
How was that not one of your two things?
I gave his regular trainer the day off, I told him Trent would be filling in.
It was an interesting interaction.
Well, according to my new cloud-based scheduling system, your trainer is out, and Trent will be filling in.
I spent 40 minutes making that water bottle pyramid display.
This guy is a psycho.
You know the best way to deal with psychos.
The silent treatment. We should draw him out by not engaging.
Nope.
The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown.
I'll make contact.
Okay, but just remember.
You're not Terry. You're Trent.
Trainer and known hemophiliac, so be careful.
Trent is also a quaker who avoids violence at all costs.
You Trent?
Yup. A black Trent. One of many.
Uh, what do you want to start with today?
Weights.
Excuse me, sir. Can I borrow this machine?
I need to be here to keep an eye on a friend.
[Grunts]
Hold on. I'm on my last set.
Okay.
Two...
Three...
Can you go any faster?
I mean, what do you need leg muscles for anyway?
You're, like, 100 years old.
Socially acceptable for you to roll around on a scooter.
I lost the count.
[Grunts] One.
One?
[Grunts]
Jake: You're not even moving. Let's go.
Get your hands off me!
I've heard about this in the news!
You're cyber-bullying me! Shh!
I'm getting the manager! Get the hell away from me!
No, you're very misinformed. Please don't...
Damn it.



Hey. Have you seen Terry? I lost him.
His children could be orphans already.
Fatherless, mother-having orphans.
I'm sure he's fine.
I think the bigger issue is the complaint I received from an older gentleman saying you tried to hurry him off his machine, in open defiance of gym protocol.
Don't do this.
I know we're friends, but if you do that again, I'm gonna have to suspend your membership.
What have you become?
Me. I've become me.
What?
Oh, sarge, thank God.
Where were you? What happened?
Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.
You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.
He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no, he respected that.
Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?
We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.
Brandon: Whew!
'Sup? Good workout.
You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.
What'd you say your regular gym was?
I didn't. Brooklyn bulk fitness.
Huh?
I work out there too.
Never heard of any Trent.
I don't know why. I work out there all the time.
Really? Starting when?
NYPD, hands on your head! My God, you're gigantic.
What are you doing, Peralta? You just blew my cover!
Or did I save your life?
Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?
I'm sensing from your tone it's that one.
Amy: I need some afternoon coffee.
[Yawns]
What's the matter with you?
Gina came by my house last night to go over the case.
Between us doing that and her using my bread maker all night, I didn't get much sleep.
I will say she makes a wonderful rye.
So dense, yet so moist.
Hello, ladies.
Since you have allowed crime to win,
I've hired a private investigator to solve my case.
Say hello to Leo Sporm.
A P.I.? These guys are hacks.
How do you know if your husband's a murderer?
You don't.
Male announcer: Call Leo now.
Leo Sporm.
How's business?
You know this guy?
Holt: Everyone knows him.
The Picasso of hucksters.
I like that.
""Look up who Picasso is.""
Sporm. Out.
Now.
You blew our cover, man!
Now I gotta go into an interrogation with no evidence and try to get jacoby to rat out his distributors!
I'm sorry, I got jumpy.
I wasn't thinking straight. It was all the exercise.
The blood from my head rushed into my delts.
Point to your delts, Jake.
There is...
You didn't have to hop in there, man.
I can handle this.
What's my name?
Terry Jeffords.
What is my name?
The ebony falcon.
And what does the ebony falcon do?
Takes every precaution to ensure his own safety? [Growls]
Takes bad guys to jail and bad girls to bed.
Hell yeah, he does.
Except now the ebony falcon is monogamous and too tired for s*x, so his only indulgence is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits.
Terry loves yogurt.
How's it going?
Well, so far jacoby hasn't given anything up, but I think Terry's starting to get to him.
I'm not talking.
You're talking right now!
Boom!
[Whispers] I'm already in your head.
Sarge is safe in there, so the longer this interrogation goes the better.
We gotta solve the case before he does.
Hey, tell me about that new system you set up at the gym for scheduling appointments.
I've been waiting so long to hear you say those words.
Come with me.
Experience the future of cloud-based scheduling.
Okay.
I put all the trainers' schedules into a shared online calendar.
Aside from the cucumber water at the front desk, it's probably my greatest accomplishment ever.
Hang on a sec. Who's this guy?
Says he's a personal trainer at the gym, but he has no regular hours.
He always makes last-minute appointments, always in the boxing area, and always late at night.
And look who he trains.
Brandon jacoby.
That's probably our supplier.
We should set up a buy from this Vladimir Rincic.
All right. We should set up a tactical team and hit the gym.
And sergeant Jeffries should stay here and keep interrogating jacoby for as many hours or years as necessary.
Are you sure I shouldn't go get him?
I feel a little uncomfortable leaving him out of this.
Don't think of it as leaving him out so much as including his babies in having a father.
Let's go.
Holt: Detectives.
Where are you going?
Just headed out to close the steroid case.
Isn't sergeant Jeffries interrogating the suspect now?
Yup, he's got that locked up.
We're following up on this lead.
The whole team is running smoothly and perfectly like a well-lubed, oiled time clock... bye.
Holt: Why do you think Gina hired that P.I.?
To mock us.
She's scared.
She's not scared.
With all due respect, sir, Gina has no feelings.
She once said the best comedy of all time was the girl with the dragon tattoo.
Well, think about how she's been acting.
Gina came by my house last night.
Do I buy an uzi?
I asked for a police officer to escort me to work, and it took a while for dispatch to find me a young Kevin costner type.
Her home doesn't feel safe anymore.
If someone broke into your apartment and you weren't cops, wouldn't you be scared?
Yes.
Depends. How many guns do I still have hidden?
None.
Do I still have my knife? Nunchucks?
Axe?
It was a hypothetical question.
I know, but I want to play it out.
Do I still have my throwing stars?
This has taken a strange turn.
Fine. I'd be scared.
We're on it.
What kind of woman doesn't have an axe?
All right, we're all set for the sting.
We got hidden cameras, wireless mics, and tactical teams by all the exits.
I told Vladimir to meet Vance Vandervaven, a.K.A. me, here at 10:00.
Said that I was filling in for jacoby.
You and I will be sparring when he arrives.
Cool. I boxed at the academy.
They invented a new weight class for me.
You're looking at the undisputed bubbleweight champion.
Terry: Hey! Peralta!
Boyle! Sarge, hey.
I'm so psyched you made it here to the sting that I definitely told Charles to tell you about.
You lied to me!
I can see that you're upset, but let's just sit down and talk about it.
Done talking!
Time to dance.
Fine. But I should warn you.
I took three years of tap.
Again, sarge, it's so good to see you.
Just out of curiosity, how did you find out about this?
I'm a Detective sergeant in the NYPD.
Holt told me. Why are you cutting me out of the operation?
What? That's crazy!
Boyle, come in here and stand in front of my body and tell him that's crazy.
Ow! My lucky face!
You gonna talk to me now?
Sure. If you could be any vacation...
Oh!
You didn't let me finish. [Laughs]
If you could be any vacation, what would you be?
I'd be skiing.
Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real.
That wasn't for real? Oh, my God.
No, wait, wait, wait! I was worried!
Worried about what?
About you getting hurt.
I don't want your daughters growing up without a dad.
I know what that's like, and it sucks.
And I don't want it to happen to them.
Why didn't you just say something to me?
Because I didn't want to get in your head and have you freak out again.
Yeah, I get it.
It's been a rough year.
But I've learned to embrace my fears. It makes me a better cop.
Tacs one and two are set.
30 minutes until the bogeys arrive.
Thanks, Boyle.
I love it when you say ""bogeys.""
So we good?
We good.
And for the record...
If I could be any kind of vacation...
I'd be lake trip.
Classic.
You're here late.
Ah, you know me. I love working.
Can't tear me away from my work.
I just love requisitions and corporate record reports.
Just, you know, messages from people for Holt.
I can imagine how frightening this must be.
I'm sorry we didn't catch the guy.
Yeah. It's weird.
It's like, why do the worst things always happen to the best people?
And what's to keep it from happening again?
We are. Come on. We're taking you home.
Really?
We installed a second lock on your front door, put locks on the windows by the fire escape, and set all your lights on timers.
That makes me feel so much better.
Thank you, guys.
And as a token of my appreciation, I would like to give you...
These.
Great.
The cool thing is you can eat whatever you want.
These are right there with you.
Hey!
You Vance Vandervaven?
Yeah. That's me. I'll be right there.
You gonna let me do this, man?
What choice do I have?
You hit me in the arms so hard they no longer work.
All right. It's time to catch some bad guys.
It good to be back.
Have a fun steroid deal, sergeant.
You're a weird guy, Jake.
Yeah.
The ebony falcon. No.
The ebony falcon had no fear.
He's the ebony antelope now.
Brave enough to drink at the lake, but wise enough to run from the lions.
Hey, my arms don't work. Can you scratch my nose?
You bet. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Thank you.
Morning, Captain.
So? How did sergeant Jeffries do?
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
He was amazing.
He made the buy, took out the suppliers, but wisely didn't take on more than he could handle.
I left one for you.
And you'll be happy to know that he punched me in the face several times.
That does make me happy.
Guess we're being candid today.
Hey, sarge, just for the record, I hope you're on every case with me for the rest of my career.
I'm not scared for you at all.
Of you a lot.
Thanks, Jake.
Oh, Peralta, I almost forgot.
My girls made you a card.
To thank you for keeping me safe.
Oh...
They're so full of potential.
[Chuckles]
Why would you show me this?

Jake: We've busted murderers, we've taken down cartels.
But today we face the worst New York has to offer...
The fire department.
Fire marshal Boone, we meet again.
Detective Peralta, your fly's down.
I made you look. I didn't look.
And I'm wearing shorts, there is no fly.
That's not what your mom said.
You make no sense.
And now I'm inside your head.

I can never tell.
Do you have a murder suspect to question?
He is in the interrogation room as we speak, sitting and, I assume, stewing.
I put on a song that I think sums up his situation nicely.

You got him, babe.
I understood the wordplay, yes.
Oh. I've been chasing this guy for three months.

So I'm just gonna grab a healthy breakfast...
Are those gummy bears wrapped in a fruit roll-up?
Breakfast burrito, but yeah.
I pity your dentist.
Ah, joke's on you. I don't have a dentist.
Jake, Jake.
Uh-oh, this can't be good.
Major crimes division just called.
They're taking over your murder case.
The vulture is on his way here now.
No! Doesn't that guy get tired of stealing our cases?
He took one from me and Rosa last week.
NYPD. Stop!
Ugh. You made us run up ten flights of stairs.
It's over.
Thanks, guys. I got it from here.
Don't worry, we can stall him until you get the confession.
We rehearsed this, you guys. This isn't a drill.
Everyone know their assignments?
All right, hands in.
Commence operation: Broken feather.
And go!
Okay, Gus, I don't have a lot of time.
I need your full, signed confession.
We have four minutes. We can do this.
But I'm not guilty. Listen to me, Gus.
We can do this, son.
Yo, is this a police station or a toilet?
'Cause all I see is turds. [Chuckles]
Oh, Detective Pembroke.
[Slow-motion grunt]
Oh, no.
I spilled coffee on you by accident.
Lucky for you, this wipes off quickly.
This coat's made out of whale skin.
The vulture still flies. The vulture still flies.
Hey, Pembroke.
What do you say we go talk about a case in the break room?
Oh, yeah? What case is that?
The case of how you got so damn sexy.
God owed me a favor.
Case solved.
I told you, I didn't know the guy.
You're lying. We have pictures of you two.
Come on, we only have three minutes.
It's like you're not even trying to confess!
The vulture is coming.
We need more time.
Someone do something.
I got it. Tear gas.
[Overlapping shouting]
Scully, Scully, wrap my shirt around your face.
[All coughing]
And out of the tear gas rises the Phoenix.
[Laughs]
[Grunts] Hey, Peralta.
I got it from here.
[Sighs] All right, fine.
I'll just go then...
With this fully signed confession.
We did it, Gus! Whoo!
Suck it, vulture.
I killed that guy and his neighbor, but you were too late.
Whoo! Wait, you killed his neighbor?
Amy, check it out.
Nice, you got it framed? Of course.
It commemorates our victory over the vulture, the greatest day in human history.
Sorry the tear gas made you look like a demon dog at the end of ghostbusters.
Brief me on the hotel robberies.
Helpful hint to the scientists that programmed you, most humans say ""hello"" at the beginning of a conversation.
Manager at the prentiss hotel told us that someone's been breaking into the rooms, stolen over $100,000 in jewelry.
We're heading over there now.
Keep me updated. Another helpful hint...
Good-bye. [Whispers] It's learning.
What?
Man, an hour of footage, and we've got nothing.
I have to admit, I do love a thorough vacuumer.
I'm a little o.C.D.
What? No, you're not.
Whoop.
I can leave it there.
Totally. It doesn't bother me.
I know.
There it is.
Terry: All right, let's get started.
So we have good news, and we have bad news.
My Nana always said, ""bad news first, because the good news is probably a lie.""
Fun fact, she made me cry a lot.
Good news is, the sting we set up to catch deadbeats went great.
Name's bill voss, just got this thing in the mail, said I won a free Bahamas cruise!
Congratulations, bill.
You have six outstanding warrants for credit fraud.
Oh, man, can't it wait till I get back from the Bahamas?
I won a cruise.
You're not very bright, are you, bill?
Now I know you'd all prefer to go to a bar, drink beer, and eat chips of various textures.
But our compstat numbers are due tomorrow morning, so I need these arrests on the books today.
Darn it. I had a belly dancing class.
Tonight was Egyptian undulation.
Oh, show us some moves.
Sure.
Holt: Dismissed.
First batch of arrest files is done-zo Washington.
There's only three files here.
It's been an hour. Yeah, I know.
It has not been a productive morning.
Gina: For example, somebody used the toaster in front of Boyle.
No. No, no, no, no. Tommy?
Gina: And then Boyle spent 30 minutes lecturing him on how to make a sandwich.
I'd describe the work flow today as dismal with a tiny, little splash of pathetic.
[Indistinct chatter]
Get me out of here, man.
Holt: I'm worried.
The compstat numbers are due tomorrow at 9:00 A.M., but at this rate, we won't be finished until your daughters are grown and married.
I may have a solution.
We need to compstat the office.
What is compstat?
It's just using data to identify problem spots in the neighborhood.
Now, I have been taking notes on points of friction in this office for years.
The red areas are places where no work gets done.
If we can fix these problems without anyone knowing what we're doing, we will finish on time.
Are you saying you want to secretly perform scientific experiments on your friends and coworkers to increase efficiency?
Yes.
Sounds fun, let's do it.
Jake: Hey, hand me some peanuts. I'm snacky.
I have something I need to talk to you about.
I might get a promotion to major crimes.
They asked me to come in and interview for a job.
What?
You're gonna go work for the vulture?
Have you forgotten how awful he is?
[Grunts]
The Vladimir putin collection?
Yeah, 70 bucks a pair.
And they only increase in value.
[Chomps teeth]
I guess that's your new best friend now, Santiago.
Emphasis on ""iago,"" backstabber.
I'm surprised you've read othello.
What the hell's othello?
I'm calling you the parrot from Aladdin.
I wouldn't be working for the vulture.
I'd be working with him in data analysis.
Oh, it's just a lousy desk job?
Okay, never mind. You're not gonna do that.
You love working cases too much.
Here's the plan: We're gonna catch this perp.
You're gonna remember how much you love your job.
You're gonna skip that interview.
And that's a Peralta guarantee.
Your last Peralta guarantee was that you could dunk a basketball.
I never said I couldn't use a ladder.
Peralta guarantee achieved.
[Grunts]
Aah!
The subtext of the guarantee was that you would be entertained, and you were.
Let's go!
Okay, so I've already taken care of a few obvious problems.
I moved the toaster to the break room, far away from Boyle.
Good. What's this red area here, the Diaz triangle?
Right, so you know about Rosa's anger incidents.
It's my birthday. I hate birthdays.
If you wish me a Happy Birthday, I will punch you.
You're a funny little bird, Diaz.
Happy Birthday. [Grunts]
Any time mt. Diaz erupts, everyone on the squad avoids her.
Mt. Diaz. Humorous, yes.
Tell me, what room is just down the hall from her desk?
The bathroom.
If people are afraid to walk by Diaz, bathroom breaks would be to a minimum.
Hey, Diaz, I just need to make sure I've got the details right in this file.
Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.
Terry: But is this the same guy?
Yeah, the name here is the same name on the checks.
Ca-caw!
Okay, all right, thank you, thank you. Ca-caw!
Got it.
Come on!
I'm so sick of these sucky computers.
Aah!
One more step and you're next.
[Grunts]

Well, that's unusual.

This is real police work, and you love it.
Remember that time you had to shove your hand down that woman's throat to get her car keys?
Why do you even care if I leave?
Because the vulture is the worst.
That whole division is the worst.
They steal cases. It's the lowest of the low.
So if I transferred somewhere else, you wouldn't care at all?
No, of course not.
Do whatever you want, you know, it's your life.
Aha! The jacket.
This case is heating up.
Ooh, receipt in the pocket.
Dust it for prints. And send a scan to Boyle.
Yes. You're feeling it now. Whoo!
The thief's name is Benjamin disanto.
Here's an old mug shot.
He's surprisingly photogenic.
A lot of criminals are, strangely.
He doesn't work here.
Must have stolen the bellhop uniform.
Receptionist just spotted disanto entering the salieri ballroom.
What's going on in there?
An auction of Greek antiquities.
Ah, I believe it's pronounced ""antiques.""
I'm sorry about my partner. He's never been to a museum.
Have so. Wax museums don't count.
Then why are they called museums?
It's right there in the name.
Oh, my God. Come on.
It's going really well, sir.
We've gone from 10 cases per hour to almost 20.
It's good, but we can do better.
Tell me about the Boyle-linetti reaction.
Terry: Boyle gets cold a lot because of what he calls his...
Medically diagnosed thin skin.
So he goes to the lost and found, and he grabs something that's usually unflattering.
That's when Gina gets involved.
[Giggles] Sweet sweater, Charles.
You look like you're starring in an Albanian remake of the cosby show.
Dr. huxtable, Dr. huxtable.
Gina is completely useless when Boyle is wearing lost-and-found clothes.
Well, I really can't blame her on this one.
Maybe we should just, uh, empty lost and found.
Already done, sir.
[Indistinct chatter]
Good lord. Where did he get that?
Oh, my God, we're doomed. Boyle looks like a lesbian.
He must have gotten it from the evidence locker or something.
Don't worry.
I had a backup plan.
I distracted her with a mirror.
She's like a cockatiel, sir...
Fascinated by her own reflection.
Mm. Hello, sexy, how are you?
Right back at ya.
Well done.
Good afternoon, sir, I'm Detective Peralta.
This is Detective always-stays-loyal.
She's named after her father Alvin stays-loyal.
We're tracking a thief that's stolen thousands of dollars worth of jewelry.
We think he's scouting auction winners, so he can Rob their rooms.
We called for backup, but we need to move now.
And we have to keep it quiet.
What can I do to help?
Well, there's too many people in here.
I need a better vantage point.
Any way I can get up onstage by the podium?
You'll blow our cover if you go up there.
You don't exactly blend in.
Yeah.
Irwin, how would you like to have the honor of being the first man to undress in front of Amy Santiago? Okay.
Here we go.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Roger strikewell, and I will be your guest auctioneer this evening.
So many faces to look at.
I won a radio contest, and I'm so excited to be here tonight to sell you all of these cool, old, Greek things.
Our first item up for bid is lot number 344.
It is this old ""vase,"" ""vahs"" if you're nasty.
It was made in the year... five and depicts the classic Greek fable: Boy meets girl, boy has goat legs.
And on the back, just a whole bunch of wheat.
So let's start the bidding at $10.
[Overlapping chatter]
Okay, started it way too low.
We've done it, sir.
If we stay on this pace, I think we'll finish on time.
I think we should keep going, make the office even more efficient.
Sir, are you familiar with the story of icarus?
He didn't know when to quit.
He flew too close to the sun, and his wax wings melted, and he died.
Are you familiar with the story of moneyball?
A man uses statistics and logic to win several baseball games.
It's my favorite film.
The statistical analysis...
[Crying] It's so beautiful.
This office is becoming a powerhouse of paperwork processing.
I'm flying high, sergeant, and I'm never coming down.
I have 85. Do I have 90?
I have 90 from the man with the face at table four.
This is terrible... you don't know what you're doing.
Adam Sandler? Yeah, that's right.
I collect antiquities. I'm a serious person.
I'm writing a movie right now about the Russian revolution.
Oh, really? Who does Kevin James play in it?
Ha, ha. It's a serious movie.
Trotsky. Ah, there it is.
But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.
I think you're gonna like it.
Thanks for dressing up, by the way.
Jake: All right, back to this plate.
I think you could use it for a variety of things.
New item up there. How much you guys wanna pay for me to stick my socks in this moron's mouth? I will.
Did football legend Joe Theismann just bid $1,000 to put a sock in my mouth?
You bet. Okay, but let's get it going a little higher.
Seriously, back to the porno plate...
Uh, 1,200 bucks, sock in the mouth?
Boom, okay, the idiot gets the sock in the mouth.
I'd say 1,300 would be even better.
1,300!
Joe Theismann coming in strong.
I got 1,300. 25,000 from... and a one and a two and a...
Boom, sold to Joey Theismann!
Congratulations, you're getting a sock in your mouth,
1,300 bucks, Joe Theismann.
Can I stick the sock in his mouth?
I'll pay extra.
Yes, you may, because I just sold my item to the man in the gray shirt at table 18.
Jake: NYPD. You're under arrest.
Heading your way.
[Upbeat music]
[All gasping]
[Grunts] Gotcha!
My leg! My leg!
You broke my other leg. Uh...
Oh, this was supposed to be a safe event.
Nothing to see here.
Except for the bone, sticking out of the leg.
Joe, I video'd it!
What a day, huh?
Met Adam Sandler, broke Joe Theismann's leg, and solved an awesome case together.
Yeah, good day.
Hell yeah, it is.
Drinks are on me.
Jake, I'm still doing the interview.
What?
No. [Scoffs]
Don't do that.
We still have to process the perp.
You love processing... It's your favorite thing, after organizing your emails and replacing toilet paper rolls.
This job would be a great opportunity for me.
Okay, whatever. You know what?
You're being a bad partner.
You're joining forces with the enemy.
And from now on, I'm gonna call you ""the cheetah.""
They're scavengers, just like vultures.
And I kinda wish I hadn't said it, 'cause they're pretty cool.
Come on, jewel thief.
You're my only friend now.
Scully, what are you doing at my desk?
And working?
What is going on today?
The Captain put me here.
Says I waste time when I sit next to Hitchcock.
Okay, well, go work in the break room.
Hello, Peralta.
Ah, a human greeting, nicely done.
Updates on the case?
Well, you're gonna love this one.
We busted the guy for grand larceny.
And to celebrate, Santiago is taking a job interview at major crimes.
Can you believe that?
Yes, she told me yesterday. What?
Why didn't you try and talk her out of it?
She would literally shave her head if you asked her to.
Which, by the way, is a great idea for a prank, if you're looking to prank her.
Santiago wants to make Captain one day.
I know, because I've frequently caught her wearing my hat and looking into a mirror.
Dismissed.
I support her decision.
That's what good detectives do.
They have each other's back, no matter what.
All right, let's move on to your unpaid parking tickets.
Dude. Dude, fire.
Oh, my. Fire.
Uh, hey! Fire! [Gasps]
Oh, I-I got it, okay.
Here we go. Here we go, Boyle.
I got it.
What happened, Scully?
I didn't know there was a toaster there.
Why is the toaster there?
Uh-oh. Aah!
My fringe!
My beautiful fringe!
Boyle's on fire! [Alarm sounding]
[Overlapping shouting]
Icarus.
Extinguisher's empty, morons.
Aah! [Panting]
Back to the drawing board.
Sir, I'm begging you, please, we have to stop.
Boyle is still smoldering.
The problem is, we didn't take Peralta into account.
In our next trial...
[Gina clears throat]
Hello, boys. Welcome to your own office.
I hear you're trying to make the precinct more efficient.
Gina, what are you doing in the Captain's chair?
Please, I'm open to any ideas about efficiency.
I've narrowed the problem down to one location: The Holt-Jeffords vortex.
Things would go a lot faster if the two of you did less experimenting and more working.
And I'm not the only one who thinks that.
You melted my fringe.
You think I have an anger problem?
I don't. You are both dead to me.
Well, I suppose it's possible we may have been a tad enthusiastic in our pursuit of efficiency...
Really? A tad, icarus?
Fine, message received.
Jeffords and I will get right to work.
Great, that will be all. Thank you.
Get the hell out of my chair.
All right, I pushed it a little bit on that one.
Okay, bye.
Ah, Santiago.
Before you go in there, there's something I have to say.
I'm sorry I said you were a bad partner.
I was the bad partner.
The truth is, our job isn't always great.
I mean, sometimes it sucks.
But it sucks a little less when I get to do it with you.
So when you said you were gonna leave, I freaked out, and that was dumb.
I should've been more supportive.
You're a great Detective, and they'd be lucky to have you.
In fact, if it helps, I wrote you a letter of recommendation, which is riddled with spelling errors, I might add.
Including the word, ""recommendation,"" which is just... I don't have to tell you about that.
There's no way there's four ""m""s in that word, right?
I already turned down the job.
Seriously?
In the end, you were right. I don't wanna sit at a desk.
And right now, I like where I am.
Ah.
[Chuckles] But thanks for thinking I'm great.
No, I take back all of the things I just said.
Uh-uh. You said I was a good Detective, and you were nice.
This is my nightmare. [Chuckles]
Lookee, lookee.
I thought I saw your big, white ass lumbering around.
As for you, Santiago, well, now you certainly showed your true colors, didn't you?
And they're a shade of pink called ""loser.""
All right, everybody just calm down.
There's no reason we can't be friends.
Here, I brought you a peace offering.
Run!
Uh-oh.

Everyone, check your email.
The greatest thing that could ever happen has just happened.
The girl who beat you for High School valedictorian died?
No, ""Kevin Cozner requests your presence at Raymond's birthday party.""
Who's Kevin Cozner?
Is he the star of ""Danzes with Wolvez?""
He's Captain Holt's husband. Captain Raymond Holt.
We're invited to the Captain's birthday party.
Oh, the Captain's party and whatnot.
I can't wait to see the inside of Raymond's house.
I'm gonna learn everything there is to know about him.
I bet it's really fancy, like Beauty and the Beast fancy.
No, it's probably just an empty, white cube with a USB port in it for him to plug his finger in when he's on sleep mode.
Apparently, my husband Kevin has invited you all to my party.
There is very little street parking, no gifts, no singing of Happy Birthday. Should be fun.
Sounds fantastic.
Did you hear that? His husband invited us, not him.
He so doesn't want us there.
Yes, he does.
Mm, it was kind of a last-minute invite.
Just stirring the pot.
Why wouldn't Holt want us there?
Because he thinks we're going to embarrass him in front of his husband, which, frankly, is insulting!
Oh, man.
All the orange soda spilled out of my cereal.
♪
[knock at door]
Happy Birthday, you sly, old fox.
How many spankings is it this year?
Peralta, please. Save some charm for the party.
Oh, you mean the party that you begrudgingly invited us to at the last minute 'cause you don't want us there?
I couldn't be happier you're coming.
And it shows. I can't wait to meet Kevin.
I assume he's the fun one in the relationship.
I'm not sure you and Kevin will get along.
Really? Well, I disagree.
In fact, I will guarantee you that by the end of the night, Kev and I will be best friends.
He hates being called ""Kev.""
Or does he? Yes.
[Grunts] Bam!
Behold, my secret weapon for winning over Kevin.
In this box is every grisly crime the nine-nine has worked in the past eight years.
Civilians love juicy cop stories.
Oh, I call that murder where they strung fishing wire through three guys.
Hey, we solved that together.
Well, tough Tetris. I called it.
Also, I've loaded all of my favorite karaoke backing tracks onto my phone.
Kevin and I will be duetting Rolling in the Deep!
That's it, emergency squad meeting, briefing room, two minutes.
Jake: Uh, adult parties?
Sergeant, I believe they're called orgies.
No-look five.
I met my wife at an orgy.
Well, she was leaving an orgy, and we bumped into each other on the street.
Real meet-cute.
Thank you for exhibiting exactly why this meeting is necessary.
Everyone here needs some instruction on interacting with grown-ups.
Sergeant, why am I here?
I'm always incredibly appropriate.
In High School, I was voted ""most appropriate.""
Ooh, self burn. Those are rare.
I shouldn't be here either. I'm fine at parties.
I just stand in the middle of the room and don't say anything.
Here are the rules: No staring at your phones, no rolling in two hours late.
No sweatpants, no jeans, and no shorts.
What about dress-up shorts?
For instance, the kind Jen Aniston might wear?
No, those are still shorts. No shorts.
And everyone bring a bottle of wine.
Why are there so many rules? I mean, next thing you're gonna say is we can't be late.
Yeah, that's, like, the first thing I said.
Ohh.
This neighborhood's amazing.
Class just seeps outta every vestibule.
Keep it in your pants, Santiago.
Scully, I specifically said, ""no shorts.""
Sarge, it's not my fault.
You said so many things about shorts, I got confused.
Man, did I screw the pooch.
Oh. Peralta, where have you been?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know, I am threety-five minutes late. Yikes!
But I had to stop and get some wine.
Hello, good sir, I'd like your finest bottle of wine, please.
That will be $1,600.
Great, I'd like your $8-est bottle of wine, please.
It's from the finest vineyard in Arkansas.
[Chuckles]
Ah, samesies!
[Laughter]
[Soft piano music playing]
Wow.
Wow.
Ah, welcome.
All: Captain.
Raymond!
Those slacks are a knockout.
Come on, Amy.
I trust you found my home easy to locate, and thank you all for wearing appropriate footwear.
Wow, you really let your hair down when you're not at the office.
Ah, detectives, meet my husband, Kevin.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Evening, so glad you could make it.
Ah, and look, he brought us some wine.
""Drink."" This is legally called ""wine drink.""
Hmm, how very thoughtful. Thank you.
It's red. Like blood.
You know, I worked a double homicide on this block a couple years ago.
The details will astound you.
Yes, I am sorry.
Perhaps Raymond didn't say anything.
Our home has a ""no shoptalk"" policy.
I don't bring home Beowulf, and he doesn't bring home cop stories.
Ah. So may I pour you some of this wine drink you brought us?
Perhaps all of it?
All of it sounds good.
Actually, Ray and I met over the phone.
Oh, they've all heard the story.
No, we haven't, and we need to.
Well, Ray was a source for an article I was writing for The New Yorker.
I asked him a series of dry questions about police work, and his answers had me in stitches.
There's no one funnier than Ray Holt.
Amen. There isn't?
Holt: We met for a drink that night, and we've been together ever since.
Yeah.
So, Kevin, I hear you're a Professor at Columbia?
That's right, yes. I head the classics department.
Ah, interesting, classics.
Zeppelin, Hendrix, Die Hard. Total classics head over here.
I'm joking, obviously. I know what the classics are.
The Odyssey and... the one you said when we got here, the wolf one.
Holt: Kevin, why don't we go mingle and let the detectives settle in?
Boyle, what happened to your shirt?
I spilled a wonderful winter salsa.
Here, wear my shirt. I was gonna take it off anyway.
Hitchcock, no!
Terry: Boyle, take my sweater.
Fits really well. We have similar physiques.
We've been here all of four minutes, and you guys have already forgotten everything I said!
Party huddle, stat!
Okay, gang, we need a new strategy.
Totally. What is going on out there?
We can't tell cop stories, Kevin doesn't find me charming, and a native English speaker referred to Captain Holt as ""hilarious."" I am flummoxed!
That's a word I learned for this party, and I am it!
Well, I'm doing fine. Really?
""Raymond, those slacks are a knockout.""
Amy: Do you think he heard that?
Only 'cause you yelled it.
Shut up.
From now on, we play to our strengths.
Charles, you know everything about food.
That's all you talk about.
I mean, I don't think anyone will ever know everything about food.
It's an evolving discipline.
That's great stuff.
It's so boring. Don't waste it.
Amy, you studied art history.
That's interesting.
Scully, opera.
Hitchcock, nothing. Talk about nothing.
Rosa, stick with Gina.
Make sure she doesn't say anything insane or steal anything.
Too late. [Chuckles]
Don't worry, it's just, like, hats and scarves and stuff.
She will put those back. I will handle the chitchat.
Well, that just leaves you, Peralta.
Amy: What's your cultural specialty?
Easy, Kevin mentioned The New Yorker, and I've totally read that.
[Laughs]
Keep a low profile, chuckle at anecdotes.
Try not to start any conversations.
Got it.
Wait a minute, you're hitchcocking me?
Well, not surprising. We're practically twins.
""Be appropriate,"" on three. Quietly.
One, two, three.
[All whispering] Be appropriate.
Now, break it up. We look weird.
Okay.
Don't move as a group. You're not gazelles.
No, no, I said, ""millimeters.""
[Laughter]
[Mouthing]
Oh, Ray, I'm gonna choke from laughter.
You're too funny!
[Laughter]
Yes, great humor words, Raymond.
You know, it reminds me of a very interesting article I read about human trafficking in The New Yorker.
No, it doesn't. Oh.
The one written by David Remnick.
I loved that piece, from four weeks ago.
Or was it three weeks? No, four.
Anyways, I was riveted.
I'm a huge New Yorker guy.
I could talk about that article for hours.
Great. That's unnecessary.
Let's do that right now.
Let's do.
Ah, there they are. Kevin, let's greet our guests.
Oh. Mm-hmm. Duty calls.
To be continued.
Totes! Can't wait!
[Whispering] I can wait.
All I remember about that article is the title.
I was hopped up on nitrous.
Well, we gotta find that magazine.
It's gotta be in here somewhere, right?
This place is like a candy store for nerds.
Stop eating crab wrong!
Ah, pepper relish on your arancini.
Very playful. Cut through the richness, add a little levity. I love that.
You really know your food.
Well, you could say it's the only thing I'm allowed to talk about.
I'm Charles. I work with Captain Holt.
I'm Vivian Ludley. I work with Kevin.
No. The Vivian Ludley?
Author of Stone Fruits and Stone-Stones: Food of the Paleolithic Era? I'm a huge fan!
It's got the best recipes for making salads out of moss.
The trick is, you have to lean into the dirt taste.
Aha. Mm-hmm.
Chickpeas, tahini, smoked paprika...
They make their own hummus.



Santiago?
Sergeant!
I'm learning so much.
We both have blue hand towels, we have the same microwave, and once I buy coasters made out of geodes, we'll both have those.
[Laughs] Yeah.
No, hey! My notes!
This is a birthday party, not a recon mission.
You can get this back at the end of the night.
Rosa: All right.
Let's go interact with these dummies.
Wait here.
What do you teach?
Comparative historiography of the French and American revolutions.
Nope. How 'bout you?
Molecular biology.
Worse. What do you study?
Abnormal psychology.
So, like, weirdos and freaks.
You should meet my friend.
Hey.
Gina, what are you thinking about right now?
I was thinking how I would make the perfect American President, based upon my skill set, dance ability, and bloodlust.
That is fascinating.
[Giggles]
""Ah-shan-ti.""
Oh, man, it's black Tom Selleck and white Sidney Poitier.
[Sighs] Come on.
All books and no magazines?
What kind of crappy library's full of books?
A crap library.
All of the magazines are in the bathroom.
Great solve, Peralta.
Ah!
Can I help you?
[Clears throat] Captain.
I didn't hear you silently sneak up on me.
Oh, that reminds me, tell Kevin that I am available for brunch on sunday the 17th.
The 17th is a tuesday.
Why are you talking about The New Yorker all of a sudden?
I always talk about smart stuff.
You know, the jazz age, what's in a name, the 1950s movies that are from the '50s.
Those were the categories on Jeopardy last night.
Don't try so hard to impress my husband.
Yes, sir.
To the crap library.
April 13th, may 2nd...
Come on! Why doesn't my life always work out perfectly?
[Knock at door]
Uh, just a second! I'm halfway done!
I'm halfway there, I'm halfway done...
With what's happening in here. Okay.
♪ Una furtiva lagrima ♪
This song gets to me every time.
It's beautiful. You must be so proud.
I sure am.
How long have you two been together?
We've been partners for almost 30 years.
So do you two ever get harassed at work?
Harassed? For what?
For being a gay couple who works together in the NYPD.
Bu-u-u-ooh...
Peralta. Hey, don't you one-minute me.
I will break that finger off. Hang up that phone.
I'm talking to my credit card company.
I tried to get an online subscription to The New Yorker, and they declined me.
Apparently, based on my previous purchases, they assumed it was fraud.
That's crazy. I'm fancy.
One time, I had coffee-flavored ice cream.
Shut up! Okay.
Hang up now.
If you're that desperate, the first two paragraphs of the article are on the free site.
Hmm. You have one minute to look it up, and then if I catch you on that phone again...
Oh, my. Don't worry.
I'm due for an upgrade, and my babies are on the cloud.
He is so strong.
Ah, thank you.
Lovely party, Kevin.
These tiny pickles are hilarious.
They're called cornichon.
So that New Yorker article about human trafficking we were discussing... Yes, so interesting, especially the first two paragraphs.
Right, but what did you think of the thesis, vis-a-vis modern slavery and its undeniable role in the economy?
Good.
If you ask me, the whole thesis was way off base, vis-a-vis the rest of the article vis-a-vis... America.
The article was antislavery.
Are you saying that slavery is good?
You know, I think you're missing the point of the article.
You must not be remembering it right.
Well, I just read it last night as I got in bed.
It's quite fresh in my memory.
Ah. You know, I would like to hear more of your thoughts.
And I would love to give them to you, but unfortunately, I have got to hit the crap library.
Excuse me one second.
My last meal on earth? Mm.
That's a great question.
I'd go classic French. Ortolan.
Tiny songbird, eaten in a single bite, bones and all in open defiance of God.
It's illegal to consume ortolan, but I actually got academic dispensation to eat one once.
Ohh. The beak, very crunchy.
That is literally the sexiest thing anyone has ever said.
How are you single?
You're not seeing anyone?
No. There is nobody in my life.
Sort of a sad thing to wink about, I realize now.
Aren't you supposed to be babysitting Gina?
Doesn't need my help.
She's over there, dazzling some psychologists.
All men are at least 30% attracted to me.
My mother cried the day I was born, because she knew she would never be better than me.
At any given moment, I'm thinking about one thing: Richard dreyfuss hunkered over eating dog food.
I feel like I'm the Paris of people.
Gerard: Complete overlap of ego and ID.
It's been theorized, but I never thought I'd see it.
I'm exquisite.
[Laughs]
[Both moaning]
I can't believe I'm frenching in the closet.
[Sighs] I feel like a teenager!
I feel like I'm 40 again.
Chew on this shiso leaf.
[Gasps] It'll give our kissing umami flavor. [Moans]
[Both moaning]
Delicious. [Sighs]
Time to put my newfound knowledge to the test.
So, sir, popcorn setting, always too short, am I right?
I'm sorry?
On our microwave. We have the same microwave.
Oh, I didn't buy it. It came with the house.
Hummus. Thoughts?
I have no thoughts about hummus.
If you'll excuse me.
Yeah.
Blink twice if you'd like me to mercy kill you.
I thought I had done enough recon, but clearly, I have only scratched the surface.
If I'm gonna bond with him, I have to massively violate his privacy.
But Truffaut wrote Breathless, and I've always considered movies a writer's medium.
I can't agree. It's godard's film.
Come on!
I mean, Truffaut is also important.
Seriously? Hold this, I gotta go.
Wow. Maybe it is Truffaut's film.
Mighty DVR, tell me the Captain's secrets.
Unveil yourself to me.
Ooh, how it's made: Contact lenses.
Bingo!
[Door closes]
What are you doing here?
I... what? I'm not. What are you doing here?
I need to find a New Yorker that Kevin left by the bed, so I can justify this whole proslavery stance I've backed myself into.
[Door opens]
Detectives!
Jake: Sarge! I see that you, like I, came up here to chastise Santiago.
Amy, this is low, even for you.
I cannot believe you would both violate the ""please stay downstairs"" rule, which was prominently posted!
Get outta here!
Holt: I don't know why we have to have this discussion again.
What do we do?
Bathroom! Bathroom.
Why are you upset with me?
Your employees are the ones putting a damper on the party.
They are acting terribly.
You're the one who's been acting terribly tonight.
You've been curt and snobby with my guests.
You've been needling poor Peralta so much, you've practically made him a new suit.
Needled him a new suit.
Even when we're fighting, you're hilarious.
Stop it. Stop it.
[Whispering] Oh, no! Dog, allergies, sneezing.
No! Get away!
Shh.
Grab the dog!
Look at me.
Do not blow this for us.
You know what, I knew this wasn't going to work.
It never has. We should've just gone out for dinner to a restaurant, like we do every year.
Why did you make me invite them?
I made you invite them because I like them.
They're good people.
[Amy sneezes]
Santiago, are you hiding in my bathroom with a dog that you're deathly allergic to?
Amy: No.
Occupied?
Well, this has been a stinky 12 hours.
My computer bag got a hole in the bottom, and my power cord fell out.
Last night was such a disaster.
I wheeze-cried myself to sleep.
Well, at least Captain said he liked us, right before he kicked us out of his house for violating his trust.
Why didn't Kevin want to invite us?
We could have been really cool people.
We weren't, but we could've been.
Well, as soon as he unveiled his ""no cop talk"" policy, I was sunk.
Gruesome murders are the cornerstone of my charm.
Well, he spent the last 30 years with a cop.
Maybe he's sick of hearing about it.
Wait.
Maybe that's not what he's sick of.
Santiago, you brilliant b*st*rd, you figured it out!
Hello again, Professor Kevin Cozner.
What do you want?
I'd like to tell you about a case I solved.
Thank you, but just as with my home, my office has a strict ""no cop talk"" policy.
I figured, but the case that I have solved is the case of the ""no cop talk"" policy.
There were three things that bothered me about last night: You didn't want the nine-nine at your party, even though you'd never met us, your friends immediately asked Hitchcock and Scully if they were harassed, and there was something interesting about that photo in your library...
You and the Captain were shunted off to the side.
I don't think you dislike cop talk.
I think you dislike cops.
[Scoffs] I'm married to one.
I know, and I can't imagine it's been fun watching the man you love marginalized, underappreciated, and disrespected by the NYPD.
Because he's gay, Raymond has been put through hell by his colleagues, many of whom, quite frankly, look exactly like you.
Devastatingly handsome?
I'm sorry, I'm uncomfortable with emotions.
So yes, I decided a long time ago that just because I love Raymond doesn't mean I have to love the people he works with.
Good solve, Detective.
Nice cop lingo.
Look, I'm really sorry that we ruined your party.
I'd like to make it up to you.
Jake: Captain, thank you for joining us.
What's going on?
Jake: A proper birthday dinner.
Amy chose the restaurant.
Captain.
Ah, perfect. I've always wanted to come here.
Jake: Boyle picked the menu.
Vivian helped.
Terry chose the champagne.
I'm sorry about your party, sir.
I tried to keep them in line, but I failed.
Well, that's not your job. I'm only sorry you didn't get a chance to enjoy yourself.
Gina has brought back all the silverware that she stole from your house.
What? Also, this clock.
Good heavens.
This isn't ours.
And my contribution will be to refrain from discussing The New Yorker for the rest of my living days.
Enjoy. Thank you, Jake.
You're welcome, Kevin. Call me ""Kev.""
Oh. What?
Oh, he told you to say that, didn't he?
Well, you are always playing pranks on me, Raymond.
Just once, let me be the funny one.
[Scoffs]
And finally, it is my great pleasure to introduce the nine-nine zone Detective Scully to serenade you.

Dryin' dishes, yeah. [whistling]
Man, charles has been so happy and confident Ever since he hooked up with that professor At the captain's party.
[both panting]
She has tenure, and also has ten years, Times two, older than him.
That sucked. Yeah.
It's nice to see him like this.
terry: he's so confident.
This morning, he finally corrected the barista When she called him ""charlize.""
He's been living as ""charlize broil"" for five years.
It's great. It's all so great.
He could take it down, just a smidge.
♪ if you like pina coladas Dead guy, charles. Sorry.
But whatever, I can handle the singing.
I'm just so happy for that guy.
It's about time he caught a break.
Sexy train is leaving the station.
Check out this caboose.
Later, sluts.
Just let him have it.
Great job, Boyle.
[upbeat music]
♪
Peralta, where are we with the black cab holdups?
Well-- I got this, jakey.
Oh, all right. Have at it, man.
gina: nice jeans, Boyle.
Those are surprisingly low-waisted.
Eyes up here, gina.
I'm more than just a piece of ass.
all: ooh.
[chuckles] not bad, not bad.
An unlicensed cab driver's been picking up tourists.
Driverakeshe vics down under the b.Q.E., Robs 'em at gunpoint, leaves them stranded.
Unfortunately, because they're tourists, And our perp is not caucasian, We don't have a clear idea of what he looks like.
He was either latino, arabor mican.
Either way, very muslim.
We'll go undercover, dress as out-of-towners, Hope the perp picks us up.
Don't worry, sarge, we'll nail this guy.
I can't believe I was just Briefly attracted to Boyle.
Ugh. Ugh!
A mr. Brain jensen here to see you, sir.
It's brian. Mm, not according to this note I wrote on my hand very quickly: ""brain.""
Captain holt, we recently met at the african-american Gay and lesbian new york city policeman's association.
Uh, yes, that name is quite a mouthful.
Just call it the ""aaglnycpa.""
Your organization has meant so much to me.
Uh, well, it's not my organization.
I mean, I did found it and I've been president For the last 25 years and I oversee every detail, But really, it's our organization.
It's yours.
And out of respect for you and everything That you've done, I wanted to stop by And let you know I'll be running for president.
I hate to run against you, But I have some ideas for change that'll Bring aaglnycpa into the 21st century.
I see.
Well, it's been good meeting you.
And, uh, I wish you the very best. Thank you.
Good-bye, brain.
It's--it's brian. [chuckles]
Very nice man.
Yes, he is.
Now, let's figure out how to...
Destroy him.
How'd the interview with the victim go?
It went okay.
The guy was from canada, said it was probably His fault for getting robbed, And apologized for wasting my time.
[chuckles] oh, canada.
Truly odie to america's garfield. Mm-hmm.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
I think I can get us some nets tickets.
No go, amigo.
Tomorrow is vivi's and my big 20-day anniversary.
I'm pulling out all the stops.
Dinner at le bonbon, With 300 roses at the table.
No. Oh, man.
Then a gondola ride along the gowanus canal.
No. No, no, no, no, no. And then, a skywriter's Gonna write, ""charles loves v.""
I couldn't afford her full name.
Okay, first of all, ""charles loves v""
Means something very specific And, I'm gonna guess, not what you're intending.
But more importantly, you're going full Boyle.
[scoffs] what? I am not.
What's full Boyle? Anytime charles gets Into a new relationship, he gets way too intense Way too fast, and it always ends in heartbreak.
We met on the subway, Went out to dinner, and I told her ioveder.
And my mom was so happy.
And then the barbershop quartet I hired started to sing.
And then she broke up with me. And then she broke up with you.
[crying] yes!
Oh, Joanna, no!
[crying] Courtney!
[crying] Rhonda!
I know when I'm going full Boyle.
Trust me, this is different.
I have it under control.
Gotta go, jakey. [sighs]
Excuse me.
Are you a detective?
Oh, uh, who's asking?
I'm super dan, Scourge of brooklyn's underworld, And I need to talk to an officer of the law.
I'm busy right now, working on this...Excuse.
I think santiago's free.
Hi.
I'm super dan.
And I have a crime to report.
Oh, gosh, I am so sorry.
I literally just retired.
This is my retirement cake. Mmm.
Thanks, you guys. I'm gonna miss this place.
Why aren't you guys taking me seriously?
Your cape and your tights, And your name is super dan, And I can kinda see your pen1s.
And it's just all a rich tapestry.
Yeah, well, I'm a citizen.
I'm from this neighborhood.
So the only reason I'm wearing this costume Is so when I'm fighting crime,, People will respect my authority.
How's that working out for you?
Detectives, when a citizen comes in off the street, It is nypd policy to take a statement.
This isn't enough of a statement?
Yes, I wanted to inquire About renting out the statue of liberty For a romantic evening.
Mm-hmm.
Is there a bed in the torch?
No? Okay.
I'll get back to you.
Hey there, charles.
I thought maybe we should have a little chat About how crazy you're acting, And how you're blowing this beyond repair.
Are you really qualified to give romantic advice?
You're not exactly the king of mature relationships.
Fair enough. But I would argue That I am like a beautiful angel of love, Who has trouble finding love for himself.
Admit that you would see that movie.
I would.
Thank you for honesty.
But this is not about me.
It's about charles.
I've seen this before, buddy, and it is bad.
Jake, I'm nowhere near full Boyle.
Then prove it. Just push your Anniversary dinner one night.
Say, ""vivian, tomorrow doesn't work for me.
Can we reschedule?""
If this will convince you, more than happy.
No problem. Great.
Voice mail.
God, I love how she says the words, ""you've reached.""
Hi, vivi. It's chucklebunny. Oof.
I'm just calling about dinner tomorrow.
I can't wait to see you, My luscious little breakfast quiche.
I just wanna draw you a bubble bath And spoon-feed you caviar.
I think we should open up a joint checking account.
I love you-- what am I doing?
It's okay. I hung up right after ""chucklebunny.""
Help me. I've gone full Boyle.
I need to focus on my reelection campaign.
Clear my schedule.
You really care about this little club, huh?
It's not a club. It's an organization That I founded over 25 years ago.
I'm proud to say we now have 50 members.
But it wasn't so easy in the beginning.
I'd like to request discretionary funds, To start an organization supporting black Gay and lesbian police officers.
[laughter]
They never actually said no, So I just went ahead and did it.
I've poured my heart and soul into this organization.
And I'm not gonna just give up the presidency.
You should make me your campaign manager.
I was born for politics.
I have great hair and I love lying.
Find out everything you can about this jensen.
I'll work on my speech.
How's this for an opening joke?
You know what the toughest part about Being a gay black police officer is?
The discrimination.
I believe that's what you call observational humor.
Probably. That's great.
All right, let's go over our disguise I am herbert goffleman from san diego.
I came here to stand in the cold Outside the today show, holding a sign
With a misspelled word on it. [chuckles]
Oh, you know what? You win.
That neon green fanny pack screams, ""gullible tourist.""
It's mine. I brought it from home.
Hey, can I have my phone back, please?
Uh, no, because you will call vivian, And you have the worst case Of full Boyle I've ever seen. What?
I found this, by the way.
You wrote ""mr. Charles ludley"" over a thousand times.
Why would you take her last name, Boyle?
[sighs] look.
For the last two years, I've been Directing all my love at rosa.
So my emotions just piled up.
And now with vivian, my feelings Are springing out of me like a fire hose.
Oh, that is overtly sexual.
Jake, I'm gonna ruin it.
You gotta help me.
All right, here's the plan.
I'll text vivian from your phone, And tell her you want it to be a double date.
That way, I can come with you and hold your hand.
Well, then your hand will be on her butt, Because my hand will be on her butt.
You gotta get it together, man.
I told you I need help!
Hey, can I get your file On that atlantic avenue drug ring?
Sarge gave me and scully the case.
What? Oh!
Why did you do that?
I-I know I deserved it, but why?
Sarge, you reassigned our drug case?
Diaz and I have been working it for three months.
Remember super dan?
The guy you ignored and made fun of?
He's been perching on rooftops at night, Secretly taking photos of drug deals.
He has thousands of images And can I.D. The entire network of dealers.
What? But you refused To take his statement, because he had a cape on.
Luckily, hitchcock and scully didn't mind.
I didn't even notice he was wearing a cape.
You're a cop. You should've noticed that.
We screwed up. Message received.
Yep, be nicer to virgins.
She doesn't speak for me.
You're not getting your case back.
Okay.
Here's what I found out about our competition.
Brian jensen, born 1899, Served in the navy during world war I.
A hero at the battle of scimitar hill, Jensen perished in a factory fire In the netherlands.
This may be a different brian jensen.
I've never been in this position before.
I've always run unopposed.
If you wanna compete, you're gonna have to have A little more pizzazz.
A couple ideas for ya.
The obvious place to start would be you, In a silver suit, With sunglasses and roller skates--
The candidate of fun.
What's your second idea? Nada.
Thought I had a slam dunk on the first one.
Hi, there.
We'd like to go to the times square.
We're brothers.
[text alert chimes]
We're all set for the double date tonight.
Vivian's bringing her friend bernice.
Bernice?
That sounds like a cartoon dump truck.
Whatever, that's probably for the best.
I don't need any distractions.
My mission is to protect you.
All right.



Hey, this guy's going the right way.
We should get out and try again.
You can let us off here.
We would like to buy some bagels.
[southern accent] and where is the s*x and the city street?
We wanna see where carrie and big live.
I'm a carrie. I think I'm a carrie.
both: we're both carries.
All right, let's prepare for the date tonight.
Here's the things you're not allowed to talk about: Love, poetry, music, or passion.
We don't have to talk at all.
I'll just stare into her eyes.
They're like little drops of cilantro reduction On lily-white flan. Okay, no.
See, no food talk.
It sets off something primal And disgusting in both of you.
It makes me wanna barf.
You're right. Look, if you feel like You can't handle it, we need a signal.
I'll do this.
[imitating gunshots]
And how would you do that naturally?
I don't know.
This guy's clean, by the way.
Can we pull over, please?
[deep breath] there she is.
I don't know if I can do this.
Listen to me. I am with you all night.
And nothing will distract me From my solemn vow to protect you, okay?
Okay.
Vivian, you look beautiful.
I love your dress. Aww.
You too, charlie. You look so handsome.
[giggles]
Steady, steady.
Jake, this is my friend bernice.
Oh, hello. I'm jak-tractive.
Jak-tractive?
Yes, my parents were hippies.
Let's eat.
Okay, so, jake, You're a cop.
I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid, Mostly because I love die hard.
Die hard, really? Mm-hmm.
Well, that makes sense, everyone loves that movie.
Oh, not like me.
I sleep in a nakatomi plaza security t-shirt.
[chuckles] oh, no.
What kinda dogs do you like?
I mean, you know, just hypothetically, If we were to get a dog.
Oh, I love all dogs.
When I was a kid, I had the cutest Golden retriever, named rufus.
That is the most amazing thing I've ever heard.
I wanna meet him.
Charles, why don't you tell vivian About the ten-day forecast?
Oh, good idea.
jake: sorry about that.
So if you're not a cop, then what do you do?
I'm in grad school.
I thought about maybe being a sports reporter, But it would be impossible for me to be objective.
I love the nets so much.
You're a nets fan? I love the nets.
Oh, my god. This season has been a disaster, right? Yes.
And everybody blames it onas kidd. Yes.
But it's like, at a certain point, Billy king is the one who put the team together.
Yes.
vivian: [chuckles] wow.
I love rainy days. My mother loves rainy days.
You should meet her.
Excuse me.
[imitates gunshots] our signal.
Uh, here's a question for the group.
What is the longest funeral you've ever attended?
Ladies first.

All of you, go home, immediately.
[scoffs]
I appreciate the effort, gina, but I can't risk Losing this election.
The aaglnycpa means too much.
Let me rehearse my speech.
Do you want a president who struggled against all odds To create this great organization?
Or do you want a great nothing Who struggled against nothing odds to create nhing Yikes.
[door opens]
The meeting is beginning.
The stakes are very high for me.
I'm getting nervous.
My stomach is in flux.
You know, in the court of louis xi, Women would only eat consomme, because They were worried that Chewing would give them wrinkles.
I love it when you talk broth.
Hey, charles, remember that dog We found on the train tracks?
Was it inside-out or just very badly burned?
Inside-out. Yeah, 'cause there were Things on the outside that Definitely should've been on the inside.
Definition of inside-out.
jake: bingo. Uh, will you excuse us?
Bernice and I are gonna use the ladies' room. Yeah.
Hurry back. Oh, no.
Jake, I can't stop looking at her butt.
Yeah, you are definitely making her uncomfortable.
And this beautiful basketball-loving Die hard fan is tearing down my walls of defenses.
If we find out that she is half-jewish, We are all doomed!
I know. I borrowed the waiter's phone When you weren't looking, and bought me and vivian Plane tickets to rome. What?
We leave in two hours.
Terrible itinerary, connect through vietnam.
All right, just go home. Get out of here and regroup.
I'll take care of everything.
I'll tell 'em it was an emergency. Thank you.
Can you make it a work emergency, Not a bathroom one?
I kinda wanna make ia.
[pounds table]
Sarge, you made your point.
We messed up.
But this is a big case, and hitchcock And scully are gonna screw it up.
I'm sure they can handle it.
They have a combined 50 years of experience.
This morning I found scully's gun In the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.
I think he was using it as a spoon.
The truth is, I had to give 'em the case.
You insulted super dan.
He refuses to cooperate with you.
We weren't that bad.
You told him his superpower was being so embarrassing That people laughed themselves to death.
[chuckles] yeah.
For those of you who don't know me, I'm officer brian jensen.
[applause]
Listen to him talk.
He has no gravitas.
Do you know what gravitas sounds like?
[deep voice] greetings, all.
Details about this organization Should be included in nypd recruitment literature And on the website.
He actually has some good ideas.
Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss him, Like you were with a certain amazing dance troop.
He isn't fit to be president.
He hasn't spent the last 25 years Fighting to build this organization.
Right. Is that bad?
I thought you created agla--naca--macapa Or whatever, so people like him Wouldn't have to go through what you went through.
Isn't it a good thing that brian jensen Didn't have to struggle for 25 years Just to get up on this stage?
brian: thank you all for your time.
I hope you vote for me.
[applause]
Greetings, all.
You know what the toughest part about Being a gay black police officer is?
The discrimination.
[uproarious laughter]
What?
At the very first meeting of the aaglnycpa, I was elected president unanimously, Because I was the only member And I voted for myself.
But after 25 years of struggle, I am no longer the only member.
And lookorward to casting my vote For someone else.
That is why I withdraw my name From consideration as president.
holt: congratulations, brian.
[applause]
If you screw this up, I will impeach you.
I wrote the bylaws, so I know how to do it.
But I'm very happy for you.
But I will impeach you, if necessary.
Anyways, charles wanted me To reiterate how sorry he is, But he got an emergency call.
And that is plausible, because we're detectives.
vivian: well, is it a tough case?
'cause charlie was acting so weird tonight.
Mm-hmm. Work has been so stressful.
Speaking of, here is your coat.
I've gotta run.
If you wouldn't mind using the back exit, It'll be much safer. Trust me.
I'm a cop. New york, right? [chuckles]
Charles, what are you doing here?
I'm so close to getting you out of this.
They're putting their coats on. Funny story--
I was walking home and I passed a pawn shop.
And then I went into a trance.
And now I have this engagement ring.
No, charles! Well, I'm gonna go ask vivian to marry me. Bye.
No, give me that. Jake!
Boyle: give that back.
I'm doing this for your own good.
You've gone full Boyle. I'm helping you out.
Give me that ring, or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
Pepper spray me, I will pepper spray you!
Huh? Mm.
No!
[both screaming]
both: aah!
Crap! Crap! Aah, crap! Crap! Aw, crap!
Hey, buddy.
Got you that fancy coffee you like.
Nah, I don't want it.
Ah, so expensive.
How you holding up?
Well, jake, I've been better.
Right. Look, I'm sorry I threw your ring in that boiling pork water.
Yeah. I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.
I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.
It burned like hell, right? Yeah.
Thank god for that soda.
[both grunting]
Ahh, it's so sticky, but it feels so good.
Ooh, cab.
After you. Yes, sir.
What are you two still doing here?
Isn't your shift over?
There's something we need to take care of.
Oh, super dan, over here. Thanks for coming.
[groans] great.
You two?
If you guys wanna make fun of me, Just come down to pita paradise like everyone else does.
We need your help. Why?
What happened to scully and hitchcock?
They're busy, cleaning hitchcock's ear.
Yeah. Did you witness any of these men Selling narcotics?
This is so official.
Yeah, this guy, number three.
That's the mope we brought in.
Yeah, okay.
We're gonna need to take your statement.
Spare no detail. Really?
Mm-hmm. Yeah!
Okay, um, all right.
Well, uh, I was driving around my neighborhood In the ""danmobile,"" which is my bike.
I know what we did wrong.
Ah, should've followed the rules, But more importantly, we're supposed To help out everyone, no matter what.
That's right.
Nice work on the arrest.
I got vaccinated that year, But then I still got the flu.
[laughs] whoa.
Don't be bummed, man.
It's gonna be okay. No, it isn't.
You can't be with me every minute of every day.
I'm in love with this woman, for real.
And I'm gonna go full Boyle and scare her off.
No, we can figure this out, all right?
I still got your phone, so you're good there--
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I think we're gonna get robbed.
I need to pull over.
Flat tire.
Give me your wallets.
Nypd, you're under arrest for armed robbery!
A little to the left, charles.
Yeah, I'm still not seeing great because of the pepper spray.
Hey, cab driver's in the interrogation room.
You ready? Let's do it.
Oh, no, what's this?
What is this? [chuckles]
I checked your phone.
There were a hundred texts from vivian, Worried about you, A selfie that I can never unsee, And dozens of voice mails.
[beep]
vivian: hey, chucklebunny, it's me.
You disappeared last night.
And you were acting weird.
And I'm worried it's because I'm moving too fast.
I really wanna see you.
And I know it's 3:00 a.M., But we should feed each other falafel In our underwear-- okay.
[beep]
I know it when I hear it.
She's full Boyle.
Full Boyle for Boyle.
I took the liberty of texting her, And telling her to come meet you here.
I thought you might wanna give her this, Or something considerably nicer.
That is definitely not platinum.
You really think this is a good idea?
Buddy, I honestly don't know, But you're definitely not gonna scare her off.
I say do whatever makes you happiest.
Jakey, you're the best.
both: ahh.
Your body is trembling like a leaf.
I'm so excited.
[gasps] yes! Yes?
Yes! [giggles]
Aww.
Charles is engaged.
You handled this really well, peralta.
I take back what I said about you being immature.
Oh, apology accepted, fart monster.
Okay.
Ohh. Oh, no.
Oh, boy. Okay.
Yeah, this is turning into a live s*x show.
Yeah, let's go. Oh, no.
I wasn't saying it in a bad way.
Jake! Yep.

Although they can't see us.

So, again, your alibi is a mysterious stranger handed you the gun, made you put your prints on it, robbed the store, and then hid the gun in your underpants.
Well, yeah, if you say it like that, it don't sound believable.
Oh, hey, Captain.
Did you get my report on the Finley murder?
Yeah, I looked it over. Nice work.
Good. Thanks, dad.
Why is everyone staring at me?
You just called Captain Holt ""dad.""
You said, ""thanks, dad.""
What? No, I didn't. I said, ""thanks, man.""
Do you see me as a father figure, Peralta?
No. If anything, I see you as a ""bother"" figure, 'cause you're always bothering me.
Hey, show your father some respect.
I didn't call him dad.
No, no, no, no, Jacob.
I take it as a compliment.
It's not a big deal.
I called Vivian ""mom"" once, and she's my fiancée.
Guys, jump on that!
Boyle has psycho-sexual issues.
Amy: Old news.
But you calling Holt ""daddy""...
Hey, ""daddy"" is not on the table here.
But you did call him ""dad,"" dude.
You shut up. You've done nothing but lie since you got here.
All right, all right, I was lying about the holdup.
But the dad thing, that happened.
Aha!
He admitted that his alibi was a lie.
It was a trap, all part of my crazy, devious plan.
I believe you. Thank you.
Son.
Do you want to talk about it later over a game of catch?
I'd like that.

Detective Lohank shaves at my desk and gets hair all over my computer.
My ""R"" key is jammed with stubble.
Well, that explains the email you sent about the ""guesome mude.""
Dismissed.
I'm pumped for these evaluations, sir.
I can't wait to hear what you have to say about my squad.
I think they've had a great year.
I feel like a proud mama hen whose baby chicks have learned to fly.
Interesting analogy, sergeant.
Chickens are famously bad at flying.
Jake: Yo.
Terry: Peralta asked to be first, which shows how seriously he's begun taking his job.
Nope, I just want to get this over with.
So I have 72 arrests, an 80% clearance rate, but most importantly, I wore a tie sometimes.
Now, I have a question for you:
Is there any way I can borrow $430,000?
Why on earth do you need that much money?
I need to buy my apartment.
I've been living at my Nana's place since she passed away 'cause it's rent-controlled, but now the building's going co-op, so I have to buy it.
I need to secure a loan by the end of the day.
Uh, so should we do a wire transfer, or do you think cash is easier?
Let's just do cash.
Shouldn't you be asking somebody else for that kind of money?
Like a bank?
Yeah, I tried that.
[Laughing hysterically]
Jake, I cannot believe you're gonna lose Nana's apartment.
We grew up together. We used to hang out there every day after school.
That's right, because there was no one to look after us, because our moms both worked, and...
[Sighs heavily] We didn't have fathers because divorce.
Peralta, I will not give you a cool half mil because you had a slightly sad childhood.
Go solve your housing crisis.
Can I go with him?
Nana made me the intelligent, sensuous woman I am today.
Weird way to describe a grandma's influence on you.
I'm sorry, Gina.
I don't know that we can spare you.
Um, these are her notes so far.
""Empanadas, Atlantic city, birth control.""
No, that's my travel journal.
I haven't started on the notes yet.
You may go with Peralta.
Both: Thank you.
I want to take Vivian somewhere romantic tonight.
How about this?
Graziolo's, for the porco digestivo meal.
It's a culinary tour of a pig's digestive track.
Pig bung gelato for two, anyone?
Rosa: Uh-oh, heads up.
Weekend crew.

Charles: I feel sad for you.
I love my desk buddy.
Sometimes Detective Kearns and I leave presents for each other.
Yeah.
Well, Lohank's a stubble monkey.
I hate him and his face garbage.
Why don't you just tell him to stop shaving at his desk?
He denies even doing it. I don't know why.
Next time I catch him shaving, I'm gonna punch him so hard in the mouth he bites his own heart.
Could that be why he denies doing it?
Oh, yeah, you could be right. Yeah.
Gina: Oh, wow.
It is always so crazy coming back here.
Remember when Nana got cable?
We watched house party 2 so many times.
It was a pajama-jamma-jam. We had no choice.
Our hands were tied. I gotta say, I'm psyched to be hanging like this, old-school stylez.
""Stylez"" with a ""Z"".
Oh, I could tell. [Laughs]
Okay, well, maybe we can figure out a way for you to afford this place.
Where's all your bank statements?
Hup, hup, before we get all financial, can I interest you in an ice-cold foh-dy?
A'ight.
So talk to me, goose. How we lookin'?
Sexy, but not like we're trying too hard.
Like, sure, we're trying, but it's almost effortless.
Yeah, no, I knew all of that.
I meant the money thing.
Oh. My first impression is that you have a debilitating spending problem.
Jake, you have six massage chairs.
Well, they don't make a massage couch.
Okay, but you also have three turntables.
Ooh, yeah! I'm learning how to spin.
Check it out.

[Chaotic klezmer music playing]
All I have are my grandma's old klezmer records, and I still haven't quite figured out how to sync up the beats, but it's not bad, right?
It's awful!
It sounds like joy behar falling down some stairs.
[Music stops] Okay, you also purchased Olympus Has Fallen on demand 12 times.
Was it a difficult movie for you to follow?
No, just watched it a lot.
So hit me.
How much do I have to cut back in order to keep this place?
Infinity percent.
Technically speaking, you're bankrupt, kiddo.
That sounds bad.
It is bad.
I only said ""kiddo"" to soften the blow, kiddo.
This is so unfair.
I've lived in this building 15 years, and then all of the sudden, they decide they're going co-op with zero warning?
It seems illegal they didn't tell you this was happening.
Well, it's possible I missed a letter, but I doubt it.
Ooh, let's check the mail tub.
Mail tub?
Nope. No.
No.
See? It's impossible to find anything in here.
It's not my fault.
This is actually a cool little bathroom.
Nice claw-foot tub.
Which I will never throw my mail into again.
Unless...
I didn't want to do this, but I do know one way we could get the money.
You'd make a decent prostitute.
I'd make an amazing prostitute.
But I was actually talking about this guy I know, Frank.
He's kinda skeevy, but he will loan money to anybody.
So he's a loan shark.
Maybe you're not thinking this through.
Says the woman who's been engaged eight times.
Uh, but never married once.
Game, set, match... linetti.
Well, it's the only choice I have.
So let's go.
Terry: Sir, I know we got off to a weird start, so to get things back on track, I'd like to bring in Santiago next.
She's had a great year.
You wanted to see me, sirs?
I was reading the sergeant's lips through the window, and he either said, ""bring in Santiago next,"" or something about a San Diego nest.
Are you ready for your self-evaluation?
I am.
I understand from a lip-reading session last week that you intend to ask us each ten questions.
Normally, yes, but for you, I have just one question.
What is your biggest...
Flaw?
My biggest flaw?
Working too hard?
Being too thorough?
Caring too much?
Got it.
Something entirely different.
Rosa, look!

I like it.
I cannot believe I am considering a non-violent option.

Gina: How much interest do you charge?
Look, I'm not a bank.
It's my own personal money.
So I take a larger vig.

Well, I don't need much.
Just, like, $430,000.
Nah, too much.
I make small loans to desperate losers.

Jake: Hey.
Mr. Henders, the King of the lobby.
Jake, the co-op board meeting was an hour ago.
I know. I am so sorry.
It's just I've been pretty busy with police work, you know, with my police friends, helping out non-police folk such as yourself, keeping you safe police.
We appreciate your service.
And I appreciate you saying that.
Look, I know there's been a lot of misconceptions about my financial situation, but I am ready to put that to rest right now.
Boom goes the dynamite. Oh, my God.
That's $20,000 right there, and I intend to use it as a down payment on a mortgage.
Where did you get this money?
Just had it lying around.
You've been an adequate tenant.
Adequate. But we needed a completed application with a bank loan by today.
With all due respect, sir, that's not fair.
I mean, I didn't even know that the building was going co-op until last week.
I got one letter.
We left you 15 voicemails as well.
Ah, voicemails. Well, that explains it.
My generation mostly texts.
I'm only 33, so...
We're in the same generation. I'm 31.
31? Mm-hmm.
But I call you ""mister.""
And you wear a suit, and...
That.
Did you just point at my bald spot?
No. Look.
We're putting the apartment on the market.
We need to get it ready for brokers to show.
We need you out by next friday.
Ohhh, next friday's a little tough for me.
Is there any way we could move it to the sunday after eight years from next friday?
Based on your judge-y eyes, I am going to take back my dynamite.
Un-boom.
Un-boom.
You got a full head... Head of hair.
Nope. Okay.
Aw, that bad?
I'm gonna be homeless.
A homeless cop.
It's like a made-for-TV movie that I will not be able to watch because I won't have a television because I'll be homeless.
Chin up, lil' pup.
First of all, you could watch it on your phone.
Second, this isn't the only apartment in the city.
We'll find you a new one.
You're right.
You're right. This could be good.
I mean, maybe we'll find a great place.
Atta girl. In a cooler neighborhood.
That's right, girl.
Maybe I'll even have a cute neighbor.
Get it, girl.
You gotta stop calling me girl.
Sorry, girl.
Amy: Okay, sirs.
I know why you weren't happy with my self-evaluation.
You didn't want me to say a flaw that was actually positive, like how the sergeant always says it's bad that he works out too much.
Whoa. Why the drive-by?
Sorry.
But that's not right, because you value honesty and humility above all else.
So what's your biggest flaw?
My biggest flaw.
I'm too competitive, prone to jealousy, ""bit of a killjoy, ""follow rules to a fault, ""don't know how to relax, and every now and then, I smoke a cigarette.""
Is that what you're looking for?
Because I can keep going.
I am deeply flawed.

Oh, Murphy bed.

Nope.

Gina, the toilet is in the middle of the living room.
I think it's sexy.

Aah!
Rosa: So when's this going down?
Well, normally, lohank hits the locker room when he goes to the gym, so let's see when he plans on working out.
So, lohank, I was reading an article about the benefits of exercise...
You going to the gym today?
Not today. Been spending all my breaks on the phone with my wife, Nancy.
We've been having marital problems.
Right, 'cause of your hygiene?
What? No, I wish.
No, about a year ago, she fell down the stairs and broke her back.
Oh, no.
Now she's addicted to painkillers.
We've been fighting a lot. Mm.
'Cause I want to help her, you know?
I guess I just love her so much.
But she's refusing treatment.
Ohhh.
We got into it again last night.
I went out for some fresh air, but I forgot to close the door, and our dog cinnamon got out.
Oh, no.
Cinnamon got hit by a drunk driver.
I wish I could say she was put out of her misery instantly, but the vet assured us that her suffering was unending and terrible.
I'm sorry.
Just venting a little. I-I appreciate...
Of course.
Anything for a good friend like you.
Charles, can I see you for a minute?
Yep.
My first question is, why are the two of you doing this self-evaluation together?
Scully doesn't handle pressure well.
[Sighs shakily] Um...
Um... Not to brag, but Scully and I have a combined total of 14 arrests.
Would've been 20, but we only got 14.
That's not enough arrests.
Well, no one asked you.
It's a self-evaluation.
Come on, Scully.
I'm trying to hurry, but when you grab the hair, it breaks apart.
The key is you use your hands like scoopers.
Just go...
Ugh.
Holt: What the hell is going on here?
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for this, sir.
Uh, we accidentally dropped all our loose hair and shaving cream in this locker, so we're cleaning it out.
Hasn't Detective lohank been through enough?
He just got diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Course he did.
Clean this up. Now.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong with you guys?
I've lost control of my squad.
Gina: Should we turn some lights on?
Trying to save electricity, Gina.
Your massage chair is on.
Yeah, I'm poor. I'm not a savage.
Man, what am I gonna do?
Well, what if I bought the apartment?
[Scoffs] What are you talking about?
And then I could rent it to you till you find a new place.
What?
How could you afford this place?
Have you been dealing drugs?
No, I'm thrifty.
I cut my own hair. I walk to work.
I eat Scully's lunch every day.
I've rented the same crap box since I was 20
'cause it's so cheap.
I've saved up money, and I'm looking for a real estate opportunity.
Ew. A real estate opportunity?
Are you being serious?
We were drinking 40's this morning.
I'm saying I could give you a fair rent because I would be your landlady.
Whoa, whoa, you be my landlady?
You're Gina.
Your lifelong dream is to be on wife swap.
You call gum ""the dentist.""
You think Ray J is a national treasure.
Yeah, so what? I'm eclectic.
You're not better than me, okay?
And I'm glad that I still own this place because I can happily invite you to leave.

Whoa, you okay?
Yep.

Oh, good.
It feels like scoliosis and smells like 10 million butts.
I take it your apartment thing didn't work out.
When did everyone decide to become an adult?
I mean, I know you were born in your fifties, but come on.
Thanks?
Get this.
Gina just offered to buy Nana's apartment as a real estate opportunity and become my ""landlady.""
Jake... I know.
She was just trying to help, but we've known each other since we were kids, you know?
I got her her job.
Which an ice cream cone could do, by the way.
And now I find out she's been saving all these years?
Jake... I know.
The person that I'm really mad at is myself for screwing this whole thing up.
I gotta talk to Gina. Thanks for your help, Amy.
Didn't say anything, don't want credit in case it goes wrong.
Yeah, that's smart, given my track record.
Hey, wait.
What would you say Holt thinks my biggest flaw is?
Who care what Holt thinks?
What's most important is what I think your biggest flaw is.
And there are so many to choose from...
Too competitive, prone to jealousy, bit of a killjoy, your shame cigarettes.
Oh, my God. But your biggest flaw is...
You suck at throwing away your secret lists.
Well, that was fun today.
Although I'm pretty sure I caught some form of face lice from that bag of hair.
Being a cop is dangerous.
Although I knew that going in.
Yeah, it was fun. Hey, you wanna grab a drink?
Oh, shoot, I would, but I'm meeting Vivian for that romantic pig colon dinner.
[Sighs] Hey, Rosa.
I want to apologize.
I haven't been much fun to hang out with over the last year or so on account of all the asking you out and smelling your hair and staring at you from point-blank range.
Yeah, you were a real weirdo. Mm-hmm.
But you're pretty cool now that you're in love with someone else.
Have a nice dinner.
Oh, we will.
They make a sorbet out of the tail.
See ya.
Excuse me, Captain.
What are you doing, sergeant?
I'm going to yell at you, and I don't want Santiago to read my lips.
Excuse me?
You were completely unfair to my squad today.
Santiago is one of your best detectives.
And all you wanted to do was play mind games with her.
Scully and Hitchcock only arrested 14 people, but that's 8 more than last year.
They only arrested 6 people last year?
And I know Peralta can be childish, but he leads the precinct in collars, and he's grown up a heck of a lot since you got here.
Okay, sit down, sergeant.
I'm going to do your evaluation now.
Sergeant Jeffords, you're right.
I have been hard on the squad.
You're a good leader.
And just the fact that you're willing to stand up for them is one of the reasons they respect you so much.
I could learn something from you.
You have every right to feel like, um, um, what was it you said this morning?
Proud mama hen, sir.
A proud...
Mama hen.
[Knock at door]
What do you want, Jake?
I'm watching Oprah's legends ball, which is what I do every time a close friend hurts my feelings.
I came here to apologize.
Look, I was mad at you for being more together than me, and that's not fair.
I felt stupid, so I acted out.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you were stupid, and you should be sorry, Jake.
But watching Oprah have brunch with her strong woman friends has taught me that it's okay to forgive.
Great.
Also, you should buy Nana's place.
Not for me.
You should live there.
You love that apartment, and you said so yourself.
It's a great investment.
Where are you gonna live?
Here.
I'll sublet from you.
I actually ran the numbers.
I'd keep paying the same amount of rent, and you would turn a small profit.
It's a starter apartment, and it's my fault for starting when I'm 33.
[Laughs]
You have a deal. All right.
Shake, shake.
Yes!
[Knock at door]
Hello, Detective.
Is there a reason you're interrupting me mid-soup?
Yes.
I'm ready for my self-evaluation.
So I asked Peralta what you thought my biggest flaw was, and he said, ""who cares what Holt thinks?""
That's not surprising.
He's very disrespectful.
But he's not wrong.
My biggest flaw is that I care too much what you think of me.
I should be more confident in my own judgment, and I am so sure of that, I don't even care if you think I'm right.
Evaluation over.
Enjoy your soup.

That's a P.U.W.
Or a portable ultrasonic weapon.
It emits a focused beam of sound which can disorient and even incapacitate a perp.
So it shoots sound? Mm-hmm.
Is this the trigger?
Yes, but you want to be careful with that.
Ahh... ah...
Thought it would be louder.
It's highly directional.
If it were pointed at you, you'd be in incredible pain right now.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh...
Why is this happening?
I can taste my thoughts!
Terry: Enough, Diaz.
Charles: Oh, my God... [Panting]
That's pretty cool.
Captain Holt?
Have you seen Captain Holt?
Tall, handsome gentleman dressed like an airline pilot?
No. Okay.
[Video game sound effects]
Your pants are up. I'm coming in.
Captain...
Think you might have a little bit of a problem here, boo.
I have this under control.
You should leave. This is the men's room.
This is no longer a men's room. It is now a liar's den.
I am Captain of this precinct, and you are my assistant.
I have given you a direct order to leave.
I do not have a problem!
If I want to play Kwazy Cupcakes, I will play Kwazy Cupcakes!
""Kwazy"" is a difficult word to say in anger, I think I've made my feelings clear.
[Gunshots]
Nice. [Chuckles]
Have you noticed they moved the trigger?
Real exciting finger feel.
""Finger feel""? Really?
[Gunshots]
Amy: Nice! Two to the chest.
Textbook shooting.
Yeah, and his overalls fell down.
I can't believe you would kill a farmer, the backbone of our nation's economy.
May I?
When it comes to shooting patterns, I like to go PB&J. pen1s, brain, jaw.
[Gunshots]
Teddy: Nice shooting, man, but do you think the pen1s is an effective target?
Interesting fact: A man can run half a mile with no genitals.
That's a weird thing to know a lot about.



Hey, hey.
Okay, so I know you're pissed at Boyle.
I told you, shooting him with that sonic cannon was an accident.
It's not just that.
Aah!
Oh! Ahh! Oh!
Whoops. Sorry. Net gun.
My cafe con leche!
[Gunshot]] Aah!
Sorry. Misfire.
[Gunshots]
Right in my breasts!
So many accidents.
Look, I get it if Vivian doesn't want me to come.
But Boyle should've said something.
We're supposed to be friends.
We're finally getting along.
Talk to him. That's what friends do.
Nope, I'm gonna wait till I'm on my deathbed, get in the last word, and then die immediately.
That's your plan for dealing with this?
That's my plan for dealing with everything.
I have 77 arguments I'm gonna win that way.
Seems like a bad plan.
Now I have 78.
[In bad english accent] Rex Buckingham at your service.
That was majestic.
Custom kneepads to help me win coolest kill.
What, don't tell me old Buckingham is the only chap here with a signature move.
Uh, no. I'm working on a thing where when I'm out of ammo I release my mag and dropkick it straight into someone's throat.
Oh! My buttholes!
Ooh...
Okay, I know you have two bullet wounds in your butt, but you've gotta stop calling them your ""buttholes.""
You know how people hold their guns sideways to look cool?
It got me thinking. What if you held your gun upside-down?
You can use that.
That will never happen, my American friend.
[Buzzer sounds]
Eight-two's done. Heads up.
Hey. How'd it go?
It went well.
We had a perfect run.
And not to brag, but I think we just set an NYPD course record for time.
Definitely a brag.
A course record? That is so cool.
Oh, thanks. I'm psyched.
Hey, good luck in there.
Thanks. All right.
All right, huddle up. This is how it's going down.
What happened to your accent, Rex?
Forget that crap. We're taking this seriously.
All right, on three.
Let's break that course record and be the best precinct here.
Ready? One, two, three!
All: Let's break that course record and... [jumbled speech]
Yeah, I agree, it was too many words. Let's do it!
Okay, I've got the details for this simulation.
A group of armed men entered an embassy and have taken hostages.
Which embassy? Doesn't matter.
Fine. Canada, then.
So take out the perps, clear the civilians, rescue the hostages?
Affirmative.
This is an active shooter situation.
You're cleared for maximum engagement.
""Maximum engagement""?
What is this, Jurassic Park: The ride?
Diaz and Boyle, perimeter security.
Me and Boyle?
Yeah. Just the two of you.
Peralta and Santiago, you're the assault team.
I'll be in the command center.
Scully, I want you to do nothing.
Just stand next to me and say, ""yes, sarge.""
Okay, sarge.
Come on, man.
All right, focus up.
We got 18 minutes, 41 seconds to break this record.
No screwing around.
Whoa, you're really not gonna do a character?
What about Rex ""Bookinghame""?
Okay, never, ever do an accent again.
And I am playing a character: A no-nonsense Detective whose only goal is to set this course record.
His name is Vic Kovac.
He's an ex-navy seal who is double-crossed and left for dead.
I don't have time for his back-story. Sarge.
Okay, guys, and go!

You were double-crossed and left for dead.

Okay, here it goes.

Oh, boy.
I thought I wanted to do this on my deathbed, but apparently I could die randomly in some hallway somewhere, so...
You didn't invite me to your wedding and it hurt my feelings.
I thought we were friends.
I'm sorry. It's just...
Vivian thought it might be weird to invite you because I used to be, you know, all-consumed by my passionate love for you or whatever.
It's okay. I understand.
Hey, thanks for shooting that guy.
Hey, my pleasure.
Ronnie: Your pleasure?
This was a human being you just killed.
Bill ""perp"" had a family.

Hostages are in there.
Intel says there's a couple of heavily-armed perps with them.
You want to wait for backup?
No time. We only have a minute 12 to beat the record.
[Sighs] I'm going in.
Don't worry. I have a plan on how to beat them.
Give up.
What?
Trust me. Or don't. I'm doing it anyway.
NYPD! Don't shoot!
I'm here to surrender.
Let the hostages go and take me instead.

Ah, there he is!

The record is ours.
That's so amazing, Jake.
Check it out. I got us prizes.
Sweet. ""Victim.""
Amy: I can't believe your final kill came with Scully's move.
You went upsy-downsies?
That's what I call it, because you hold the gun upside-down.
Yes, Scully, I went upsy-downsies.
And none of you will ever speak of it again.
But I want to speak of it. You looked really dumb.
[Chuckles] Man, I feel so good.
Almost makes me want to start taking things seriously all the time, but them I'm like, ""boobs, fart, boobs, whatever.""
Alright, let's go. Drinks are on me.

Actually, Teddy asked me to get dinner, so maybe I can meet up with you guys afterwards?
Oh. Neat. Yeah. Of course.
Cool.
Boobs. Fart. Boobs, whatever.
So I just talked to Vivian.
I told her I really want you to come to the wedding, and she said okay.
Thanks. I'm excited to go.

What do you think Amy sees in Teddy?
So you do like her. I'm just curious.
I mean, I guess he's okay-looking.
And he's a good cop.
They're both kind of dorky about police stuff.
Also, he set the course record, but that's nothing. I broke it, like, 20 minutes later.
You want to know why she went out with him and not you?
Yeah.
Because he actually asked her out.
Hey, Vivian.
Rosa.
I'm here to celebrate with the team.
Look, I'm not really good at this stuff, but...
Thank you for inviting me to your wedding.
I'm really happy I could come, and I promise it won't be weird at all.
Yeah, I'm really happy you could come too.
'Cause I didn't think it was gonna happen.
What do you mean?
Well, Chuck told me you were gonna be out of town that weekend, and then, you know, he just told me that your plans changed, so, uh... so yeah, so that's great news.
Why would it be weird?
Um, it'd be weird 'cause I'm weird.
Oh.
Whooo...
I'm leaving.
Amy: Night, everyone.
Hey, Amy. Check it out.
No way, you won coolest kill?
Not even close.
It turns out anyone can just buy themselves a children's karate trophy.
Smart. Yeah.
Hey, before you go, I wanted to ask you something.
Amy: Of course.
I was just wondering...
Are you wearing lipstick?
Yeah, I'm going out with Teddy again.
Does it look weird?
I called my 13-year-old niece for makeup tips, but I don't know if I trust her.
She is so sexual.
You look great.
Thank you.
So what's up?
Oh. It's not important.

Charles told me you insisted that I come to breakfast.
Because of it being such an important one.

Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.
Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?

What? Get off of me! That was a fake excuse.
Of course. Totally.
Look, I can't talk to Vivian for you. This is crazy.

So, Vivian, do you ever go watch hockey?
No, I'm not one for sports.
Of course you're not.
My graduate student told me the craziest story about her family.
[Laughing] That's hilarious!
Hey, can you pass me the maple syrup, please?
Speaking of, where does the best maple syrup come from again?
Vermont.
Oh, and Canada.
Canada? Hey, that reminds me.
Weren't the two of you talking about maybe moving there?
Oh, yeah, we are so excited to start this new chapter of our lives together.
Yeah. Well, although I have to say, as someone who's read many of the older chapters in Charles's life, I wonder if that's the best thing for him.
That's so sweet of you to care, but...
Chuck is excited about moving to Canada, right, baby?
Mm, mouth full. I love you.
But what about his job and all of his friends and his Brooklyn-based pizza blog?
Do they even have pizza in Canada?
Yes, it's puffier, and it's sweet.
It's called Manitoba Sauce Cake.
Okay, there's no way Charles wants that.
Jake, I think you're overstepping here.
Charles and I both want to move to Canada.
Is that true, Charles? Is that what you want?
Uh, yeah.
I want to retire from the force and move to Ottawa with Vivian.
And frankly, I have no idea why you're getting involved.
And no one asked for your stupid opinion.
Vivi...
We're leaving.
What?
Detective Diaz...
I gather that, once again, things did not go well with Officer Deetmore.
All due respect, sir, it's how I was trained.
You mess up, you get made fun of.
It's like scientist zapping a rat when it messes up in a maze.
Oh, I get it.
When I was a young officer, I was that rat and got zapped.
And all I wanted was to be captain and throw some lightning bolts.
Emperor Palpatine. [Buzzes]
I do not know who that is.
But a real leader doesn't zap people when they mess up.
They teach them how to fix the problem.
I think you're a leader.
So act like one.
I'll try. I'm sorry.
Please, Diaz. No need to make a scene.
I can't believe he's moving to Canada.
I know.
And I tried to help him, and he fully threw me under the bus.
So I quit as best man.
Jake.
What?
I did everything right.
I was loyal. I put up with all his dumb ideas, his spicy cake, his champagne made out of olives, reading his vows as a recipe.
""One teaspoon eternal love, a dash of peeing with the door open.""
Okay. That's hard to hear.
Yeah.
I just don't understand why he's being so weird.
I can't believe he would turn on me like this.
He's not being himself.
Maybe because he's facing a terrible decision and he doesn't know what to do.
Yeah, that sounds right.
I think he needs his farm lover.
It's pronounced ""for-lohver.""
I don't have time to teach you Danish.
I gotta go help Charles!
I'll find out where he is and text you.
That would be helpful!
Charles, get in the car.
No!
Go to heck! [Siren wails]
Don't siren me.
You quit on me as best man, I'm not talking to you.
Police. Stop walking.
[Grunts]
Ah, I hate that I'm so by the book.
Listen, Boyle, you're not handing in those retirement papers without telling Vivian how you feel.
I won't let you.
Oh, really? And how are you gonna stop me?
Baton to the knee.
Baton to the knee?
[Thud] Ahh! Oh!
Hey, Deetmore.
I'm sorry for making fun of you in front of everybody...
And also for making fun of you behind your back.
Didn't know you did that, but thank you for the apology.
I'm not done.
Also, I'm sorry for making fun of you during my book club.
Those people don't even know you.
That was uncool.
Also, I'm sorry... it's okay. I get it.
No.
Also, I'm sorry that I didn't take the time to show you how to fix your mistake.
Come on, we can go over it upstairs.
Thanks. That'd be great.
Oh, one more sorry.
You're about to see a drawing I did of you in the elevator.
Just remember I was really pissed at you at the time.
[Elevator bell dings]
I'm unquitting as your best man.
Oh, how kind of you.
Are you also taking me to the knee hospital?
Your knee is fine.
Besides, you had it coming for throwing me under the bus like that.
I'm sorry. I was terrible to you.
It's just I don't know what to do.
I know, it's tough.
But I'm here to support you and not just in your weird, awful wedding decisions.
""Awful""?
Uh-oh. Did I just plan the worst wedding in history?
Second worst. Red Wedding, Game Of Thrones.
And, no, your wedding is gonna be incredible because it's exactly what you want.
What you don't want is to go to Canada.
So I don't care how many buses you throw me under, I'm making you talk to Vivian.
Okay, thanks. You're right.
And you know what? I'm ready.
No, I'm not! I'm running away!
Boyle, no!
I'm not ready! I'm not ready! I'm not ready!
Hey, superstar.
Why the long fart? Oh, I meant ""face.""
Why the long face?
Keep walking, Linetti.
Okay, but this shake is really good.
Listen. Shh, shh.
Listen.
[Slurping]
That's it! I give up.
Why do you care so much about this diet?
Just stop. You're in perfect shape.
Mm! Amen!
I'm not doing it for me.
My wife is on a diet.
She's a little self-conscious about her body since giving birth to twins.
It's crazy!
I think she looks perfect, and I tell her that all the time.
Mm, and I love that you do that, Terry.
She's running around after those girls all day, and I'm not there to help out.
This was one thing I thought I could do with her.
But I'm too weak.
Just hand me that milkshake.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing? What...
Thank you.
We are still a team, and we will keep you from eating so you can support your wife.
Thank you, team.
However, just to be clear, Gina and I are still gonna eat.
I'm eating right now, Terry... corndog.
Come on. There we go.
[Grunts]
You got this, all right?
Ah, hello, Vivian. Charles has something he'd like to say.
In case he tries to flee.
[Sighs]
Vivian...
We need to talk about Ottawa.
Jake.
Oh.
Hey.
How'd it go? Everything okay?
Vivian and I talked for hours.
There's a lot more to discuss, but it's a start.
And you were right. She didn't dump me.
You did good. I know you were scared.
Hey...
Your duties as best man aren't over yet.
What? Whiskey and cigars!
Mm-hmm.
Thanks for being the best best man.
To the fancy brudgom!
[Sighs]
Ah! Ah, spicy! Why is that spicy?
Man: Not a doctor. Shh.

Whoa. What's with the cast? I sprained my wrist.
Oh, no! What happened?
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
Yeah! Geez, Amy.
Back off.
Leave the guy alone.
[Whispering] All right, huddle up, everybody.
Bring it in, bring it in!
So he wouldn't say what happened, which can only mean one thing.
He's in a fight club.
Jake: No.
He did it doing something he's embarrassed by, like smiling.
Only question is, how do you hurt your arm smiling?
Charles: Could be a sports injury.
I sprained my wrist in college playing field hockey.
Men's field hockey? Yeah.
It's much more violent than the women's game.
We're not allowed to wear anything that protects our breasts.
Attention, everyone, I can hear you speculating about the nature and origin of my injury from my office.
I tripped over an uneven sidewalk.
I did not think it was relevant to your jobs, the jobs which you should all be doing right now.
Get to work.
Do you wanna know how I actually hurt my wrist?
Yes.
I was hula-hooping.
Kevin and I attend a class for fitness and for fun.
Oh, my God.
I've mastered all the moves.
The pizza toss...
The tornado...
The scorpion, the oopsie doodle.
Why are you telling me this?
Because no one... Will ever believe you.
Jake: No. No!
You sick son of a bitch.
♪ ♪
Jake: Hey, hey!
What has three thumbs and just made another arrest?
This guy!
It doesn't work if you don't put your thumb up.
Thank you!
23 solves in one month. New precinct record!
Yeah! [Cheers and applause]
Thank you, thanks.
Dance with me, Jakey.
[Salt 'n' Pepa's Whatta Man playing]
Ha! No, and I will never dance to that song.
Wait to go, Jakey! Whoa!
Are those thumbtacks? What the hell, Scully?
I thought they'd make good confetti.
Why?
This took a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights.
Take the weekend off, Peralta.
Jake: Thank you.
You know, I actually might.
I'm severely sleep-deprived and I'm way behind on laundry.
Good work. Oh.
That's nice.
Hey!
What's with the bag?
Are you going on a cruise with your mom... in 1913?
This is a very stylish bag.
Teddy and I are going to the Berkshires for the weekend.
Oh, for like a police conference?
Nope, just a romantic getaway.
Wow!
That's great. I know.
We're kind of taking things to the next level.
What are you doing this weekend?
Oh, opposite of the Berkshires.
Work-shires. Working, whole weekend.
Fighting crime.
I thought you were taking the weekend off to do your laundry.
Does crime take the weekend off to do its laundry, Scully?
No, it doesn't. Sorry.
Can I call you back? Bye.
What's up? Looking for paper towels.
What are you doing in here? Talking to Vivian.
We're still trying to figure out whether we should move to Canada.
It's awful!
Thank God it hasn't affected how much we bathe together.
Almost never?
All the time.
Thing is it's so hard to talk at work because there's no privacy.
The roof is freezing, the holding cell is full of perps, and their romantic advice is not great.
It's always to tell Vivian, ""bitch, get your life right!""
I tried it. She did not like it.
Let me work on it.
Ah.
Hands up, cop.
Hey... no, no. Oh, no, no!
It's Teddy, your boyfriend!
Aww, boyfriend. Yeah.
Can you release my arm?
Oh, yeah! Sorry.
[Laughs] Good one.
[Laughing] Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to see you before we left for the weekend.
Gina: Aw, that's so gross.
What's this weekend?
We rented a cabin in the Berkshires.
We're taking a couples cooking class, and there's this great antiques fair.
Sounds like you two have a wonderful lesbian vacation planned.
Now my question is, will you be back tomorrow afternoon?
Because that is when you promised Holt you'd help with his community outreach meeting.
That's this weekend?
I totally forgot.
How did I let the Captain talk me into that?
Excuse me, everyone.
Would one of you be willing to...
Me! I'll do it!
I volunteer all my time.
Crap. What am I gonna do?
Well, it's okay. We can reschedule.
I mean, we'll lose the deposit, but...
Mm, or you could just lie to Captain Holt.
That's my policy for everything and it always works.
I'm not gonna lie.
I'll just tell the Captain I made a mistake, and he'll understand.
Mm-kay.
But if you do lie, you can't go wrong with dental emergency.
Or death of a triplet.
Now that one you can use twice.
[Chuckles] Smart.
Good news, sergeant.
I figured out what we're gonna work on this weekend.
I'm working on spending time with my family.
We're having a fancy tea party.
I am the King of origami napkins.
Oh, that's nice.
I thought you were taking the weekend off.
No, I decided to spend the weekend taking things to the next level.
Work-wise.
I found a cold case of ours that everyone foolishly said was unsolvable.
Case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ.
Jake, case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is unsolvable.
Or maybe case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is waiting for someone to de-unsolve it.
What's case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ?
Case 52ABX... we gotta find a way to abbreviate this thing.
Anyway, it's an old case that the sarge and I worked about eight years ago.
This guy Nate Dexter was murdered in a boat explosion.
No witnesses, no leads, minimal evidence.
This case almost killed us.
Yeah, but I'm on a hot streak!
Plus we're better detectives now.
We're smarter, computers are faster, no more blockbuster.
Drones?
I'm feeling it.
That was creepy. Huh?
But... convincing.
Oh, he's standing up.
I've always wanted to solve that case.
Then think about how good it would feel to finally do it.
What's the best moment of your life?
My wedding day.
Tied with the day my babies were born.
Compared to this, those memories will be garbage.
You don't know what you're saying.
'Cause I'm not married and I don't have kids. Right?
Okay.
Okay, here's what we know.
Nate Dexter was a small-time crook who pissed someone off.
They blew up his boat, with him still on it, and left no evidence except this one charred finger and Nate's melted torso.
Man, I'm having deja vu right now.
Whoever did it left no evidence, except one charred finger and Nate's melted torso.
So in other words nothing's changed.
Except our attitudes.
So! We start at the last place that Dexter was seen before he went to the marina...
His apartment.
I'm telling you, sarge, I got a good feeling about this.
Aw, no!
Well, it appears his building was torn down.
I know this seems like bad news, but on the plus side the harder the solve the sweeter the solve.
No, it's just bad news.
You're bad news.
What? What?
Just saying you're bad news for bad guys, 'cause you're a number-one cop.
Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!
What? What?
Let's solve the case!
Rosa: Hey!
We need to tell Charles about Babylon.
He needs a private place to talk to Vivian.
What? No! Babylon's our secret place.
It's the best thing in my life, and I have a very full life.
Do you know I know Papa John? The Papa John.
Someone is lying to you.
We can't tell Charles.
He's incapable of keeping a secret.
[Whispering] I shouldn't tell you this, but we're throwing you a surprise party later!
Look, we tell Charles about Babylon, or I shred your nap blanket into a million tiny rags.
No! I love wolfie. Fine! You win!
Tell Charles.
Hold me close, little wolfie.
Hold me.
Jake: All right, convict.
What do you know about the murder of Nate Dexter?
Look, I'll tell you the same thing...
I told you eight years ago.
I don't know anything about Nate Dexter.
And even if I did...
The best French toast I ever ate was with mayor Lindsay's dog.
He's very old, he's lost his mind.
[Cell door buzzes open]
We're making progress!
[Knocks on door] Hello, Captain, my old friend.
I've come to talk with you...
Again.
I've lapsed into song lyrics.
Santiago, can I help you?
I need to speak with you about this weekend.
Ah, yes, I'm so happy you'll be there to oversee the audio-visual presentation.
The last time did not... Go well.
The next chart shows the drop in the crime rate over the last month. [Beep]
I just erased everything.
I'm so sorry, but I think I'm gonna be unable to help out tomorrow.
Why is that?
Dental emergency.
I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.
Wow, you must be in a lotta pain.
Yeah, I've been in pain for days.
I had no idea you were living like this.
No one knows.
I am a rock. I am an island.
I have lapsed into song lyrics again.
Okay.
Alfonso: That's all of 'em.
What? What about to Frank Williams?
He's in the infirmary.
He was beat up pretty good, a lot of internal bleeding.
Awesome!
I mean, not the internal bleeding thing.
That sounds horrifying.
But I bet you we can get him to talk if we offer to move him from his current address on beatdown boulevard.
That's a great idea. Looks like we got lucky.
Jake: Hey, side note...
""Beatdown boulevard,"" good name for my debut hip-hop record.
Strongly disagree. Okay.
Charles: Will you just tell me where we're going?
Guys? Guys!
Oh, my God, you're gonna beat me up.



[Harp music plays]
Welcome to Babylon!
Rosa: It's our secret bathroom.
It's so beautiful.
There used to be a transit police squad down here.
This was a Captain's bathroom. I found it a while back.
She told me about it a year ago when I got stomach flu from that sewer rave.
Fun night though.
Rosa: We put a lotta effort into making this place nice.
Look.
Weird crystals.
[Sniffs]
Also, lavender-scented candles, a zebra-skin rug, and the toilet paper is, mm, triple-ply.
Wow.
It turns anyone's bottom into a VIP.
More importantly...
Rosa: It has great cell service.
We thought you could use this place to call Vivian when you need to.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone about this.
I pinky promise.
Not good enough.
Blood pact! Ahh!
All right, Frank, let's recap, shall we?
You slipped and fell onto a shiv.
Then you got up and fell backwards onto another shiv.
And finally one last shiv fell from the ceiling and into your body.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
I think you got shivved.
What do you guys want?
Terry: We wanna make a deal.
You know anything about the murder of Nate Dexter?
Maybe.
What do I get if I do?
How about a transfer to another cell block?
One with fewer shivs.
Okay.
I can't be sure, but I think Dexter owed money to a guy named Sam Bunsen.
And... that's a new lead!
First lead in eight years.
You were right.
♪ Ohhh, beatdown boulevard ♪
♪ Is the toughest street in town ♪
No, no.
♪ And if you step to a gangsta crew ♪
♪ You're bound to get beat down ♪
♪ Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪
Santiago. How are your teeth feeling?
Gina: Oh.
Dental emergency?
Yes, it just sorta happened.
It still hurts, but I can make it till tomorrow.
Well, if you're in this much pain, I don't think you should wait.
My brother-in-law is one of the top oral surgeons in the quint-state area.
That's two better than the tri-state area.
He's agreed to see you tonight at 6:00 as a personal favor to me and Kevin.
Wow! Tonight!
Thank you.
But that's not gonna work...
Because of the anesthesia and driving myself home.
I'll just go tomorrow. Teddy can take me.
Nonsense.
I'll drive you to and from the dentist's office myself.
That's great, just great.
He's a good dude.
He's a good, good dude.
Jake: Hey, sarge.
No sign of Sam Bunsen in the federal database.
You got anything? Bad news.
I only found his wife and she hasn't heard from him in eight years.
That doesn't sound good. Yeah.
That's why I started by saying ""bad news.""
Terry believes in having a clear topic sentence.
I bet Mrs. Bunsen is lying. She knows where her husband is.
I pushed pretty hard.
She said she's willing to take a lie detector test.
Well, then let's bust out the polygraph.
Lie detector truth or dare!
No. Boyle, last time we did that, you ended up telling everyone you had a crush on the teapot from Beauty and the Beast.
It's the way they drew her.
[Door slams]
All right, pretty boy, where is it?
Where's what?
The secret bathroom.
Secret what? Bathroom where?
Okay, Captain, I'll be right there!
Don't lie to us.
We've been watching you.
11:18 A.M., Rosa told you to follow her, and you guys left together.
Scully: You returned at 11:31 smelling of lavender.
[Mouthing words]
And you've been drinking chamomile tea all day long and haven't been to the men's room once.
Since when are you two so into being good detectives?
Since it came to secret bathrooms.
Tell us where it is!
Now!
Okay! Please state your name one more time.
Are we really doing this again?
It's, like, the fifth time.
That's a lie! It's only the fourth time!
No?
Okay, my bad. Continue.
I'm Sophia Bunsen, I haven't talked to my husband in eight years.
This is Nate Dexter. He was friends with my husband.
I didn't know he was dead.
You think my husband killed him, but I guarantee that's impossible.
Okay. Good.
But not good enough! Let's do it again.
Jake, what's going on with you?
She passed the test like five times.
Or maybe... She's in cahoots.
With him! Hmm?
Are you two cahooting?
Are you cahooting?
Jake! It's over, man.
We had a lead, now it's dead.
It happens! No.
If it's not her, and it's not him...
Which I'm still not convinced of, by the way, then it's gotta be the machine.
Strap me in, sergeant.
I'm taking this thing for a test drive of truth.
Thanks for taking us, Marty.
Please, Ray, we're family.
[Mumbling]
Neither of us can understand you at all.
Ah.
The visual examination doesn't show much inflammation, but these x-rays should be more telling.
Let's see what's beneath the surface.
Oh, stop!
Santiago.
I...
Oh, God.
I forgot I promised to help you, and I made plans to go to the Berkshires with my boyfriend.
Oh.
Wait.
So you lied to me to get out of work?
Yes.
I may be a liar, but I've got great teeth.
And no one can take that from me.
Have you heard of ""over-brushing?""
Oh, no.
Your aggressive technique has stripped away the protective enamel and much of your gum.
You have seven cavities.
I have to say... I feel like you deserve this.
[Whispering] Charles!
What the hell is wrong with you?
You told Hitchcock and Scully?
No! What?
Yep, this... is... happening.
They were scary.
It was like that moment in Planet of Apes when the monkey talked.
Charles: Look, I'm sorry.
You let me into your special place.
Ew. I messed up, and I'll fix it.
It's okay, Charles, you don't have to.
No! It's not okay. Babylon hath fallen.
Charles betrayed us and I will make him pay for it.
Rosa: Gina, enough.
Boyle needed a bathroom, so we told him about it.
Just like I told you when you needed it?
Leave him alone. He saved my life.
Plus... he's pitiful.
And his life is crap right now.
Yeah! It is! Thank you, Rosa.
I'm telling you this machine is broken.
Ask me a question.
Is Jay Z really your favorite artist?
Yes, obviously.
Lie. [Scoffs]
See? It's busted. Is it?
Or is your favorite artist really Taylor Swift?
[Scoffs] No.
Lie. All right, fine.
She is.
[Quietly] She makes me feel things.
She makes me all of us feel things!
Look, that machine is working just fine.
Why are you being so crazy about this case?
I wanted to work the toughest case we had.
Why?
Because it would feel awesome to solve it.
Because a real man doesn't run from a challenge.
I mean, do they run from the bulls in Pamplona?
Yeah. That's the whole point of it.
Seriously? That seems lame.
I don't know why you wanna spend the entire weekend at work, but I'm going home to my family.
See you tomorrow, Jake.
Fine, abandon me!
I don't want you here anyway.
That's a lie.
Come on, man.
[Siren]
I got here an hour early. This better be good.
Hmm? Holy Moses!
What happened to you?
I have not slept in, since I last saw you, many hours.
Plus, I think I'm hallucinating because I'm pretty sure I just heard your biceps mocking me.
No, that's possible.
My biceps mock a lotta people. Mm.
Good to know.
So I rewatched the interrogation, and get this.
Sophia wasn't lying about anything.
She doesn't know who killed Nate Dexter.
But... she does know something way better.
Come with me.
Jake! Hmm?
People normally move after they say that.
Oh, yeah, I feel asleep for a second.
Sorry.
Come with me.
Okay! Ahh!
Y'all ready for this? You know what I'm saying?
Terry Jeffords, allow me to introduce to you...
Our murder victim, the not-dead Nate Dexter.
What the hell is going on?
[Mimics explosion] Right?
Sophia wasn't lying.
I was just not asking the right questions.
She hadn't seen her husband in eight years, but she was positive there's no way that he killed Dexter.
That's when it occurred to me, no one killed him.
Hey, Nate, just talking about how you're alive.
Yeah, I'm alive.
But whose melted torso did we find?
Sophia's husband.
Yes!
Sophia and Dexter were having an affair, husband found out, Nate killed him.
Now I'm telling my friend about how you killed that guy.
It was for love!
Cool motive, still a murder.
Also, you remember that severed finger?
Check this out. Hey, Nate.
Show us your hands, please?
Ho-ho! Right?
Cut it off himself. How screwed up is that?
Anyway, I asked all of my CIs if they had dealings with a nine-fingered man.
Unsolvable case... Solved!
Whoo!
What'd you wanna talk to us about?
Well, I got Hitchcock and Scully to promise never to use our bathroom again.
How'd you do that?
The Donald and I call it ""the art of the deal.""
You want your bathroom back, fine.
I want your chair. Mine smells like my butt.
Ew! Fine.
And we want your coyote blanket.
It's not a coyote, it's a wolf.
Learn your animals, idiot.
[Sighs] Told you she wasn't serious.
Let's go, Scully.
Fine!
I can't believe you gave up wolfie.
It was worth it.
Plus, I'm done with wolves now.
I'm into angry unicorns.
[Giggles]
If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.
Amy: Jake!
Nice job on the case. Great solve!
Thanks. Aren't you supposed to be in the Berkshires?
I had a dental thing.
But you're such a good brusher.
I know! [Laughs]
Turns out that was my undoing.
Classic. Yeah.
Hey, you remember Teddy.
Oh! Yeah. Hey, man. How are you?
Teddy: Great solve.
Can I buy you a Pilsner? They have awesome Pilsners here.
Teddy's really into Pilsners.
Cool!
Attention!
Everyone raise your glasses to the amazing Jake Peralta!
Today, he did the impossible.
He closed case 52abx-dash-32qj.
[All cheer]
Speech, speech, speech!
Look, the real hero here is the murderer.
Because without him there wouldn't be a case.
So... here's to Nate Dexter, the murderer.
[All cheer]
Captain... I wanna apologize for lying.
Thank you.
Next time just talk to me.
Okay.
Now I know this comes on the heels of betraying you, but... can I have next weekend off to go to that cabin in the Berkshires with Teddy?
Okay.
[Sighs]
Thank you, sir.
[Laughs]
I still can't feel my mouth. Did a little bit dribble out?
What's going on with you?
For the past two days, you've been telling me how amazing it was gonna be to solve this case.
This does not look amazing.
I don't know, man.
I thought I'd be more psyched too.
Maybe I just need a cooler case. No.
That is not gonna work.
You set the precinct record, you weren't happy.
You solved an unsolvable case, you weren't happy.
No case is gonna make you happy.
[Sighs]
Something's bothering you.
And whatever it is you gotta deal with it.
Yeah, well, maybe I can't deal with it right now, or...
You know, whatever.
[Chuckles] I know!
Oh.
That's a tough one.
Yeah.
But solving more cases isn't gonna make you feel any better.
Having a drink with a friend might though.
Thank you, but I don't think another drink is gonna help.
I think having a lot more drinks might help.
[Laughing] There he is!
So... Amy, huh?
We're gonna need some shots.

I didn't wash my hands, and I don't care.
Yup.
Cool to be some place right when things get good, right?
Another pitcher of your strongest beer, please, good sir, and a glass thingie to drink it out of.
And one of whatever this guy's having for that guy, and one of what that guy's having for this guy.
And another round for everyone, on me!
[Cheers and applause]
That's right. That's right.
Thanks, buddy.
What's the occasion?
Oh, I'm celebrating.
My name's Jake Peralta, and I just got fired from the NYPD.
♪ ♪
All right, listen up.
What you're about to see is highly disturbing, but please, no comments.
This man is in pain, so above all else, be kind.
Good morning, Boyle.
Let's just get it out there.
Vivian broke up with me last night.
I'm sorry, chucklebunny.
Charles, wait!
Yes?
Your food dehydrator.
Oh, God.
It's official.
The wedding's off, and this is what I'm like now.
Life is a pit.
Gina: Excuse me?
I don't understand. Did you already have a matrix getup at home for some reason?
No, Gina, I bought this with the money I was going to spend on our honeymoon to cape canaveral.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
Don't be, I'm settling into the darkness nicely.
I definitely get you now.
What you got there, Boyle?
Eggs in a bag.
Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even food.
Now, I only eat for sustenance.
[Sighs]
Smart. Save that for later.
[Chuckles] Peralta?
My office, now.
Sir?
Ah. Commissioner Podolski.
It's been a while. Maybe because you haven't put any of my children in handcuffs recently.
Yay, enemies for life. [Chuckles]
Peralta, have you been investigating Lucas Wint?
Uh, yeah, I have.
I think he's laundering money for drug dealers.
Don't be an idiot. Lucas Wint is a civic leader.
He runs a major charity, his community center is the lifeblood of that neighborhood, and he officially claims you have been harassing him.
What? That's insane.
I've been trying to talk to him, and he keeps avoiding me like a guilty person, so I approached him at his weekly basketball game.
Hey there, Wint, I got a couple questions for you.
I told you to back off.
This is completely inappropriate.
No, this is me scoring in your face!
Kobe!
Seemed like an obvious goal-tend, but that's besides the point.
Peralta, do you have any evidence to support your suspicions?
There's a lot of chatter amongst low-level drug dealers.
Chatter? Sorry, I know.
I hate that word too.
Tittle-tattle.
Just stay away from Wint.
That's an order. [Sighs]
Captain, I'm telling you this is reliable tittle-tattle.
You have to trust me.
Trust me.
It's in your best interest to back off.
Fine.
But just for the record, I think you're both wrong.
Self dismissed.
We have to help Charles. He's devastated.
Rosa: I hate seeing him like this.
Breakups are cartoony, thumbs down.
They make people feel face-with-xs-for-the-eyes.
What does that even mean?
The english language cannot fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts, so I'm incorporating emoji into my speech to better express myself.
Winky face. Oh, lord.
Listen, this is simple.
Boyle needs a little rebound nooky.
Eggplant emoji.
Rosa, you wanna get on that?
Don't make me rip your tongue off.
I would talk to him, but I don't think I have any advice.
All of my breakups have been completely mutual.
This is the best possible option for both of us.
Agreed. Take care.
That was the end of an eight-year relationship.
You know, I haven't had that many romantic breakups, but neither of my children will speak to me anymore.
All right. None of you are any help.
Sarge and I will cheer up Charles.
Oh.
He's not even chewing them anymore.
Ugh.
Listen to this text Boyle just sent me.
""I finally know what used napkins at a barbecue restaurant feel like.""
I hate breakups.
I hope I never go through one again.
Really?
You think you'll spend the rest of your life with Teddy?
What? No.
Maybe. I don't know.
Just saying getting dumped is a nightmare.
No arguments here.
I remember my worst breakup.
Eighth grade. Jenny Gildenhorn.
Hey, Jenny.
Jake, I don't wanna go out anymore.
I like Eddie Fung now.
But it's my bar Mitzvah.
We were gonna grind.
That day, I truly became a man.
Wonder where Eddie Fung is now.
867 Clinton street, apartment 2A.
I know exactly where that b*st*rd is.
[Chuckles]
Get down, it's Wint!
Wha... Wint? Holt told you to drop that.
I thought we were working a burglary.
I know, I lied. Apology? Apology accepted.
Look, Podolski is wrong. Wint is guilty.
Yesterday, I saw him get into a car with a known drug dealer.
I didn't have time to take a picture, but today, I came prepared.
Did you tell Holt what you saw?
No, I don't trust him on this.
How can you not trust Holt?
He's the executor of my will.
Wint has crazy ties to city hall.
I just don't think Holt would risk giving up his command.
Anyway.
Oh, crap. Where'd he go?
[Knocks on door] [Sighs nervously]
Hello, Detective Peralta.
Amy.
Tell me who's there.
I'm blind.
You disobeyed my direct orders to drop this case.
I staked out Wint 'cause I got a tip he was meeting up with a drug dealer.
And why didn't you tell me about this?
Because you told me to drop the case.
Look, let's just agree to say ""I'm sorry"" on the count of three.
One, two, three.
See? Now, I'm just disappointed in both of us.
This is unacceptable, and you've crossed the line.
Sir, I am Amy Santiago, and I have something to say.
I think you're wrong.
I think Detective Peralta is onto something, and you should let him pursue it.
I'm Amy Santiago, and I'm done talking.
Good, because this is none of your concern.
Commissioner Podolski is bringing you up on charges and specs.
You're facing a six-month suspension, and you're on administrative leave until the hearing.
Now, get out of my office.
Fine.
Here's my gun and my badge.
I don't need those. You're not suspended yet.
You're on administrative leave.
You never let me do anything cool.
Ah. Good morning, Captain.
I got you your favorite breakfast, a plain bagel and a water.
Don't try to soften me up.
Why'd you ask me to meet you in this alley in Bensonhurst at 9:00 in the morning?
Look, my best chance of not getting suspended is proving that Wint is guilty.
I got a confidential informant I need you to meet.
You continue to work this case against my direct orders?
You astound me.
Thank you, sir.
You astound me as well.
But I didn't find him.
Santiago did.
What is going on with you?
I don't know, sir.
We're both off-roading it here.
My internal GPS has been recalculating for a week.
This is lsaac.
He used to be a pusher for the bay Ridge boys.
Dude, drugs don't need pushing.
They push themselves. People love drugs.
Tell him about the donations.
All right, look, every friday, I put cash into a duffel bag and bring it to Wint community center, room 265, and they mark it down as a charitable donation in their account book.
Ergo, laundering.
So why should we believe you?
I don't care who you believe.
Just know I hate those dudes now.
They carved up my territory so bad, I had to quit selling drugs, and I love selling drugs.
It was my dream job.
Sir, I filled out a warrant request to search the community center for the account book.
I need you to sign it before I can take it to a judge.
I know I'm asking you to stick your neck out, but please trust me.
Fine.
But I'll be with you every step of the way.
You know, you should just put a microchip in his neck like a little doggy.
All right, Isaac, thank you.
Yeah, you're done.
All right, guys.
We have Peralta's hearing at 4:00.
Anybody seen Boyle?
Present.
He seems even worse than before.
I lost Vivian, and now I might lose Jake.
I don't know what else to do.
I've tried being supportive.
I listened to him talk about Vivian's lips for over two hours.
He kept describing them as ""ample.""
So ample.
Rosa.
Have you ever been dumped?
No.
In all my breakups, I'm always the dumper.
I know you're having a hard time, but I think I can fix this.
There's this thing that I do whenever I... Feel.
What?
Burn everything.
[Gasps]
Okay. This feels right.
No, it's terrible! Vivian, I won't let you burn!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ow!
Ah! Ooh!
Ah! Oh, that's so hot!
What is that? It's coffee.
[Sighs] Hot coffee?
Look at us, three rogue cops taking on a case the commissioner told us to drop.
Button up your jacket. Sit up straight.
Judge Mindel has a reputation for being strict and proper.
All right, no worries.
I'll just act like you.
Say something so I can get the cadence of your voice down.
I will not. Perfect.
I will not. I... Will not.
I will... Not.
Have a seat, Detective.
I will not.
Excuse me?
Uh, sorry.
I meant out of respect, I will choose to stand.
Sit, I will not.
[Sighs] This looks like it was filled out by a toddler.
Now, we're going to have to go through this point by point.
Justice cannot be rushed.
But could it be gently nudged into hyper speed?
I take it you're the toddler.
[Gulps] [Phone rings]
Excuse me a moment. Mm-hmm.
This is going terribly. New plan.
I'm gonna charm her.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry. I had to take that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Captain Raymond Holt.



What's up?
You wanted to see me, sarge?
Yeah, come on in, Boyle.
Sorry to hear about your hand.
Thanks.
It makes it really hard to manipulate my egg sack.
Look. Here's the deal.
I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.
And my girlfriend Chiaki? She broke my heart.
[Speaking japanese]
[Speaking japanese]
I stared at the paper walls for weeks until my roommates showed me how to vent my feelings.
Take a plate and smash it.
Oh! [Both laugh]
Feels good. Yeah!
All right. Your turn, Boyle. Okay.
Vent those feelings! Okay.
Here we go, sarge. Yeah.
[Groaning]
Oh, my testicles!
We got a warrant. But now, we need a plan.
We can't just go in there in our uniforms.
They'll destroy the evidence before we even walk through the door.
Good point, Captain Holt, or should I say ""Captain Raymond s*x vibes""?
Who knew you had such game?
Yes, I've found that many women want what they can't have.
I get it. Ew.
Jake: What the hell is going on?
According to the community center calendar, amateur ballroom dancing competition.
Ah, okay.
I know how we're gonna blend in.
Don't say ""thrift store.""
Thrift store!

Jake, the overwhelming time pressure.
Yep.
All right, Isaac said the account book was in room 265. It's gotta be upstairs.
Let's head up.
Hey. Where you goin'?
To the dance contest.
I am nationally-recognized fox-trotter Dave Blathis, and these are my proteges, Rhonda Shawarma and Hank Frankel.
I don't care who you are.
Upstairs is closed to the public.
Fine.
But we didn't have to endure this crap when we danced in Barcelona.
[Sighs] The hearing's starting any second.
There may be another staircase off the dance floor.
I'll sign us up for the contest.
Good idea. Oh, and Amy.
Hm? Your dress makes you look like a mermaid.
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.
I know we're all concerned about Boyle, but again, there is a solution.
Forget your ex with meaningless s*x.
It rhymes because it's true.
All right, everyone.
Peralta needs us to stall.
So just keep your answers long.
Add stuff. Embellish your asses off.
Boyle, you're first.
I don't know if I'm up for this.
I'm so emotional. I can barely think straight.
Great. Use that.
Embrace the void.
Would you say Detective Peralta was overly interested in the Wint case?
I only heard Detective Peralta talk about Lucas Wint once.
We were in my car.
I took Vivian on our first real date in that car.
Vivian is my fiancee.
My ex-fiancee.
My never-wife.
Detective Boyle, if you could, please limit your comments to the matter at hand.
I will.
I'd just like the record to reflect that ""matter at hand"" was one of Vivian's favorite expressions.
We should try to blend in.
Stretch your leg up over your head.
What? You stretch your leg up over your head.
You think I wouldn't if I could?
Ugh.
Ooh, looks like the Captain found a partner.
Jake: Good lord.
Okay, we begin with a free-dance period to the spicy sounds of rumba.
All right. The linoleum awaits, my dear.
Oh, boy.
I know we're undercover, but I'm starting to get real nervous about this contest.
You need to see a therapist.
Yeah. Let's dance this way.
Okay. [Groans] Ho, hoo.
How did you manage to step on both of my feet at the same time?
I'm horrible at this. When can we stop?
I'm horrible at this... I know, I know.
Title of my s*x tape.
Huh, well done.
Title of my s*x tape.
Oh, my God, the Captain.
He could really win this thing.
How did you get so amazing at dancing?
Jake, focus.
I found a back stairway over here.
And spin.
Who is he?
As far as I can recall, Detective Peralta told me that... [Clears throat]
That...
He...
No, I never heard Jake talk about Wint.
And the very fact that you have him on trial is cat-doing- home-alone -face.
Of...
Look, I've known Jake forever.
Our friendship is little-boy- holding-little-girl's-hand.
God, that guard by the door will not move.
Uh-oh, he just made eye contact with me.
Play it cool. Dance.
Dance, dance, dance.
You don't have to say ""dance"" every time you make a step.
Good call. Hey.
Do you want me to actually show you how to do this so you don't hurt yourself and possibly others?
Yes. Okay.
[Clears throat] Ready?
Mm-hmm.
This is kinda fun.
Yeah.
Maybe Teddy and I should take a class.
Yeah. Maybe.
Guys, we're running out of time.
What's the plan? That guard won't move.
We need a distraction.
I'm on it.
Dance, dance, dance, dance.
Oh, God! Oh!
My ankle! Sir, my ankle!
Oh, I heard a pop! I heard a pop!
Is that bad? Do you know if that's bad?
Oh, God! Oh, I live to dance!
[Cries]
[Groans]
[Sighs]
Ah. Voila.
So glad no one heard me say that.
Gotcha.
Aw, this is incredible.
The account books have everything.
Dates, names, dollar amounts.
I can't wait to show this to Podolski.
I should probably slip in a Miley-Cyrus-told-you-so face real quick.
It's hard to do on the move.
Peralta, wait.
Santiago, give us a minute.
Sir?
I need you to do something.
And it's gonna sound crazy, but it's important, and I need you to trust me.
So Detective Peralta...
Do you have any evidence you'd like to present on your behalf?
No.
I have nothing.
Jake. What happened?
Did Holt ask you to get suspended?
No, he told me to get fired.
Why? I don't know.
I'm kind of freaking out.
He said to do it, and the next thing I knew, I was just yelling.
And your mother! All of your mothers.
And your grandmothers.
And your grandmothers' little dogs.
Are you done? No, I'm not done!
Aw, you're done! You can't handle the me!
Oh, my God.
Holt: Peralta!
Hey. What's goin' on?
This is special agent Clarke with the FBI.
FBI? We couldn't let you expose Lucas Wint.
It would've compromised a much larger ongoing federal investigation.
We believe that Wint has ties to the lanucci crime family.
That's one of the best crime families.
We needed you to get fired for real because the lanuccis have moles inside the NYPD, and we need them to trust you.
Detective, we'd like you to go undercover and help us with the investigation.
Okay, the answer is ""yes.""
The details are: My name is Duncan buck.
I was raised on a oil rig by 90 men and I prostitute.
We'd like you to be yourself.
Even better. This could be very dangerous.
So please, take some time, and...
No need. I'm in.
Eyes closed, head first, can't lose.
I don't think that's the expression.
Can you just let me have this?
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Detective Peralta will be going in an undercover assignment with the FBI.
His cover story is that he was fired.
Oh, my God. My heart just threw up.
Look, they're saying this assignment will last about six months, so while I'm gone, Boyle, I want you to have my desk.
I'll sit at it always.
Rosa, you can have my locker.
Sweet.
Amy, you can have all of my open cases.
Holt: Okay, that's enough.
Peralta doesn't have the authority to do any of this.
You will all sit at your own desk and work the cases I assign you.
But you will be missed.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you for trusting me.
Okay, now call us all names and storm out of here for the benefit of the bullpen.
[Sighs] This is the best day ever.
[Clears throat]
I'll miss you guys.
And your mother!
And your mother.
You're all a bunch of pigs!
I smell bacon!
And guess what else, ""Captain""?
You can take this tie and shove it straight into your hellhole!
This whole place reeks of bacon.
And guess what?
I'm going kosher 'cause Jake-y don't dig on swine!
Whoo!
All right, everyone. I wanna make a toast.
To you guys.
You will never be Jake or Vivian, but at least you're here.
Ugh, I'm gonna go over by the bar where I can hear you worse.
Oh, I get it. I'd abandon me too.
That's it. Boyle, no more eggs.
You are drinking your troubles away.
Start with this.
I'm gonna get some bottles from the bar.
Make way! Large man helping his little friend.
Comin' through!
You're so lucky you've never been through a painful breakup.
The only reason they haven't been painful is 'cause the guys were all losers.
I've never dated anyone good.
Hmm.
Like you.
Amy?
Hey, thought I missed you.
Hey, Jake. Amazing assignment.
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.
Really? Mm-hmm.
Well, if you want, I could help you get fired.
I'm really good at it. [Laughs]
Yeah.
This is real. This is happening.
Look... [Chuckles]
I don't wanna be a jerk.
I know you're dating Teddy, and it's going really well.
It's just... What's going on?
[Sighs]
I don't know what's gonna happen on this assignment.
And if something bad goes down, I think I'd be pissed at myself if I didn't say this.
[Sighs]
I kinda wish something could happen between us, romantic-styles.
And I know it can't 'cause you're with Teddy, and I'm going undercover, and that's just how it is.
But... [Police radio chatter]
Anyway, we're not supposed to have any contact, so I should go.
America needs me. [Chuckles]
Bye.
And another round for everyone on me!
Thanks, buddy.
What's the occasion?
Oh, I'm celebrating.
My name's Jake Peralta, and I just got fired from the NYPD.
I'm Leo... Ianucci.

Great recap.
Holt: Welcome back, Peralta.
Captain.
Everyone has a lot of work.
So you have exactly two minutes to share personal anecdotes.
And those two minutes began when you entered.
You now have...
12 seconds left.
Challenge accepted. Undercover highlights.
Fixed a boxing match, smoked a whole cigar without vomiting, was once in a room with ten guys named Sal, and missed you all so very much.
Everyone back to work.
All right, Jake.
Hey.
So...
Didn't get a chance to say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Can we talk in private for a sec?
Okay.
So now that we are alone, I have to ask.
Did you arrest a perp named Joe Uterus?
[Sighs]
Oh, my God, yes.
I should have told you immediately.
Perp name hall of fame, right?
Oh, yeah. First ballot.
I mean, it's right up there with Sylvester stools and Janet Storkmuncher.
[Both chuckle]
But also, I just...
I know we left things kind of weird.
You know, me saying that I liked you.
I'm still with Teddy.
Romantic styles.
Oh. Good, good.
'Cause I was gonna say, I know we left things weird, because I said that I liked you, but that was a mistake.
You know, I was nervous about going undercover, and I think I just kinda freaked out, and you were nearby, so...
I didn't mean it.
But that's great.
Good.
Hey, so, Joe uterus, what did he do?
Killed a bunch of stray dogs.
Eh.
Name's funnier than the story.
There's a confused old woman here who wants to talk to a Detective.
Oh, come on!
Another drill?
Hello, my name is Adelaide.
I'd like to report a crime.
So we're just doing one of these every day?
Oh, you got it. I know you got it.
I want my money.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
Why are we doing this?
It's Captain's orders.
My name is Adelaide Van Hoyt.
I'm 89 years old, and I'm here to report a crime.
Not a problem. We can help you.
Adelaide Van Hoyt.
89 years old.
Goatee, 6'3"".
290 pounds.
Hey! This is a tight 240.
Show Adelaide some damn respect.
[Sighs]
Hey, Charles.
You pretty excited about Jake being back?
Yeah, it's like when I was a kid and my grandma came home from the hospital, only better because Jake's not unresponsive.
Huh, every time you talk, I heard that sound that plays when pac-man dies.
Charles, I'm concerned that you're gonna tell Jake about the incident.
[Both scream]
Nobody can ever know that we had s*x, all right?
I have spent years cultivating a reputation as someone who sleeps with bike messengers or better.
Look, I don't want people finding out about it either.
I don't wanna be known as the office slut.
Yeah, well, Jake's back, and you tell him everything.
No, I don't.
I got aroused last night watching a nature documentary on bees.
I was fine until they went inside the hive.
Oh, you're right.
I'm gonna tell him.
It might not be today, it might not be tomorrow...
It definitely won't be later than tomorrow.
So pretty much today or tomorrow then.
Peralta, special agent Marx is here to make your transfer back to the NYPD official.
And on behalf of the bureau I wanted to personally thank you for your service.
Bureau.
It's FBI lingo for... ""FBI.""
Yes, I've been a cop for 30 years.
And I've seen movies.
Roger that.
You'll be happy to know that the operation turned out to be one of the biggest Rico busts of all time.
""Rico"" stands for ""racketeering investigative cop... awesome.""
I have to ask, do you think ""awesome"" begins with an ""O""?
Yes.
15 of 16 targets are in custody.
Wait, who got away?
Freddy Maliardi.
The tac team screwed up, hit his apartment up a couple of minutes late, and he disappeared.
But Freddy's, like, the worst of all those guys.
Extortion, terrible breath, murder.
I put ""terrible breath"" too high on that list.
I should go back undercover, see if any of my contacts can tell me where he is.
No, they're looking for a rat.
And as a former cop, there's no way they're gonna trust you.
I guarantee you they do.
Me and those guys went through some pretty intense stuff.
All: ♪ sing us a song, you're the piano man ♪
In the mafia, once you Joel together, you're bonded for life.
Look, you know those guys, but I just think this is too big of a risk.
There's nothing you can do.
Sometimes things are just out of your control.
Not good enough.
[Rock music]
Boyle, we're going undercover.
You look amazing.
But you smell really bad.
That's my cologne.
Welcome to the mafia.
Okay, if Freddy's still in town, Benny de Conti will know about it.
He owns the restaurant they all eat at.
He knows everything about everything.
Good. Hey, when you were undercover, did you, like, have a mafia best friend?
I'm not jealous. I'm just wondering.
Uh, I don't know, I guess I did a bunch of jobs with a guy named Derek.
Great.
Great.
Derek. Sounds like a great guy.
Charles, don't do this to yourself, all right?
Okay, fine.
All right, so we're going to the restaurant.
What's my cover? Am I in the mob?
Ooh, I've got the perfect thing.
A sun hat?
Mafia!
No, just be yourself, a cop.
Benny might think I'm a rat, so I'll go in and talk to him.
Then you come in a minute later with your badge out, pick a fight with me, and punch me in the face.
No, I could never hurt you, Jake.
Well, you gotta hit me somewhere.
Fine, it'll be the balls then.
No! Just hit me in the face.
Look, if it's so hard, imagine I'm somebody you hate.
Derek.
I barely know him!
Fine.
Come on.
Captain.
We are done with the drill.
The old lady confessed to a 40-year-old unsolved murder in Rhode lsland.
We filled out the interstate file request and remanded her to the custody of her daughter.
Adelaide has successfully transformed back into a giant man, sir.
Well done. Thank you.
See?
Instead of resisting, it's better to just put your head down, get the job done, and then you can get on with your day.
Hi, my name is Timmy, and I'm lost.
Son of a bitch!
Captain!
I hate to be harsh, but I think that these drills are slightly unnecessary, possibly.
Although you are the boss, and your judgment is impeccable.
And I guess what I am trying to say is thank you.
I agree, with the stuff about the drills, not the spineless ass-kissing.
Sir, I think it would help if we knew why we were doing these drills.
Because I ordered you to.
Resume the drill, Timmy.
And do not do or say anything that a seven-year-old boy would not do or say.
Feel free to consult the script I've prepared.
Okay, but, uh, it's a little stilted.
""I am feeling trepidation at the prospect of a parentless existence.""
No kid talks like that.
Those lines were lifted verbatim from my boyhood diary.
Resume the drill!
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Not for nothing, I heard you were arrested.
I made bail.
Ahh.
Look, I'm looking for Freddy. You seen him?
It's funny. Lot of people are looking for that guy.
Lot of cops especially.
Didn't you used to be a cop, Jake?
[Laughs] I'm just kidding, man.
I know you, we sang piano man together.
This guy. I got you.
You got me. You got me. Yes, you. I got.
Yeah. Look, I can't tell you where Freddy is.
But I can tell you his girl, Bianca, just called in.
You know, Freddy's regular order delivered to her address.
Thank you so much.
See ya.



Well, if it isn't Jake Peralta.
Mafia crapbag.
Get out of here, Boyle.
I know that we used to be friends, and during that time we would do all kinds of things together like make plans, but that has changed, all right?
Ahh! Ow!
Now the balls.
What? Ohh!
What's going on? You never eat with us.
Or talk to us.
I accidentally smiled at you last week and you shined a laser pointer into my eye and screamed ""perv.""
Yeah, well, something's about to be revealed that's gonna change my social standing forever.
I'm one of you now.
Prettier and different and better, but I'm one of you.
This is great.
With three people we can have a real massage train now.
[Laughs] Ugh.
I am so sorry.
What the hell, Boyle?
What the hell happened?
I-I-I was stressed about hitting you, and my mind disassociate from my body.
I don't even know what I did.
Oh, well, let me remind you.
You punched me, kicked me, spat on me, and then you said: There's more where that came from.
I got a real wet mouth.
You gotta admit, it's a pretty tough line.
No, it's not.
It's weird and sexual, and not in the good way.
The only good news is Benny couldn't possibly think we planned that. My cover's safe.
All right, Bianca lives here.
I'm gonna go in alone.
If I need backup, I will hit the clicky button on my keys.
Copy that.
Time to get back into character.
Cologne me, bro.
Okay, here we go.
Aww! It stings. The cuts.
It stings. Stings!
I can't stop hurting you. What is wrong with me?
[Sharp breaths]
Okay, keep going. Okay.
[Groaning] Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I miss my mommy. This is boring.
Captain's not here, sarge. You can drop the act.
You can drop your butt.
You can drop your butt!
It's okay, I got this.
How about we finish building this tower?
The structure's done, but we've barely started on the landscaping.
I wanna build a spaceship. [Gasps]
[Screams]
I worked so hard on that.
There were stables.
These toys suck.
Okay.
Then I'll get you some better toys...
Timmy.
[Knocks on door]
Hello.
Hey, you're Bianca, right?
Mm-hmm. I'm Jake.
I'm a friend of Freddy's from work.
I'm looking for him.
Well, which Jake are you?
Are you Jakey lady hands or are you Jakey the Jew?
Well, it feels weird saying this but I hope Jakey the Jew?
Mm. Jake Peralta.
Freddy actually said I should come by here if I was ever in trouble.
Oh, okay.
Well, Freddy was here, but he left.
But come in. Come on in.
I got the address somewhere. Hold on.
So did he say where he was headin' or...
I heard about you, Peralta.
I know you were the rat.
Get 'em up, get your hands up.
[Laughs] Yeah. Lady hands.
All right, just stay calm, Bianca.
Empty your pockets. Okay, reaching in.
Pulling stuff out.
I don't have a gun.
Just a wallet and some keys.
Nothing strange about it, okay?
This is just the clicker for my car.
[Car beeps] Jake!
[Car beeping]
[Groans] Come on.
It's not a weapon.
Nothing bad's gonna happen if I just click this.
I know what a car key is.
Yeah, these are them.
I know!
[Car continues beeping]
Oh, crap, my gun.
[Car beeps]
Oh, come on!
Just get it down! All right, don't shoot!
That's how people get shot.
Just shut up! Shut up!
[Bang on door] NYPD, drop your weapon.
[Shrieks]
All right, Bianca.
What do you know about a guy named Derek?
Charles, no.
[Distant thudding]
[All laughing and cheering]
Jump, Timmy, jump. Woo!
Now you're having fun.
Sergeant!
Captain, we were just, uh... Timmy was cranky.
We're just letting him ti himself out.
Okay, everybody out! [Machine powers down]
Terry: Okay, it's just kinda difficult.
Because of the deflating.
Out. Now!
Turn on the pump!
I'm very claustrophobic!
Just tell us where Freddy is.
I'm not gonna sell out Freddy.
We're in love. He introduced me to his children as his favorite assistant.
Come on, he has a dozen mistresses and six girlfriends.
Freddy loved me. He implied that many times.
There's nobody else, okay.
Yeah, there is.
I just wish I could remember who.
So many people were sleeping with each other.
It's kinda hard to keep track.
Well, I actually thought of a song that helps me remember.
Let's see, it goes... [in tune of Dem Bones]
♪ Mario is doing it with Teresa ♪
♪ Teresa is doing it with Paulie ♪
I knew that.
♪ Paulie is doing it with Lisa ♪
♪ And Lisa's doing it with Anthony ♪
I really like this song. Did you come up with the melody?
I'm pretty sure I did.
♪ Freddy is cheating with Bianca G. ♪
♪ But also with her younger sister Valerie ♪
No. Oh, yeah.
I saw them together, that's why it's in the song.
I knew it!
Ooh, that son of a bitch!
All right, fine.
He's going to the Teterboro airport.
Because Freddy is going to Barbados.
Oh, well, well, well.
Good thing someone came prepared.
We're not going to Barbados, Charles.
We're gonna stop the plane. Come on.
Right. Let's go.
Oh, my God. What is on your sweater?
As everyone knows, my spirit animal is nature's greatest predator, the wolf.
But I committed a horrible sexual blunder and I'm no longer wolf-worthy.
My spirit animal is now this: The naked mole rat, God's disgusting mistake.
Yeah, it's pretty ugly.
Hey! Only I get to talk about my spirit animal that way.
You don't get to say that.
Come on, Amy.
You're not gonna apologize, sergeant?
No, I was trying to lighten the mood.
The squad's been stressed since these drills started.
Plus you ordered me to act like a seven-year-old.
Seven-year-olds like to have fun.
That's true.
When I was seven I used to sneak into my Father's office to see his collection of antique globes.
Sir, it's hard to motivate the squad when we don't even know why we're doing these drills.
This hasn't been announced yet, but...
There's gonna be a new commissioner of the NYPD.
We're all gonna be under a microscope.
And I want us to be prepared for anything.
You should have just told us that.
I was trying to shield you.
Do you know how much stress I've been under lately?
My husband says he hasn't seen me smile in weeks.
How much did you smile before that?
Constantly.
I don't know what's going on down at police headquarters.
And no one will tell me anything.
So you're saying that not knowing what your bosses are up to is driving you a little crazy.
You've used my logic against me.
Well played, Timmy.
Well played. Thank you, sir.
Look at that.
You helped me find my smile.
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh, no! Dammit!
What do you think you're doing?
Jake Peralta, NYPD.
I need you to shoot down that plane.
I can't do that. Look.
This man was on board. I have to follow him, so I need to commandeer one of these planes.
What's the easiest one for a complete beginner to fly?
He wasn't on that plane.
That guy's plane left like an hour ago. Great.
That's fantastic.
Charles, may I borrow your hat please? Sure.
[Yells]
It's all right. High tech rayon, it's fine.
Hey, buddy. Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just cleaning out my desk.
Trying not to think about how Freddy got away.
Oh, I didn't let anyone touch anything while you were gone. And that was a mistake.
I left food everywhere.
This drawer is completely full of maggots now.
Eww! Wanna get a drink?
Nope, I think I'm just gonna stay here and stare into the maggot drawer.
Hey, that's a good name for a death metal song.
[Metal singer voice] ♪ stare into the maggot drawer ♪
You wanna talk about it?
My death metal album? Sure.
I meant do you wanna talk about what's wrong?
There's nothing to talk about. The operation was a failure.
Jake, you put away 15 high-ranking mafia guys.
Yeah, and one of them got away.
It's a disgrace.
You did everything you could.
I mean sometimes there's stuff you just can't control.
Why does everyone keep saying that to me?
You should be proud.
You didn't hold anything back.
Huh, I think I like this new forthright and confident version of Charles.
Let's go get that drink.
Because there's a surprise party and it's my job to get you to the bar. What?
I mean it's my job to get someone to the bar for your surprise party. Dammit!
There it is.
Aha, surprise! What?
[All cheering] No way.
I am floored by this. Charles, you tricked me.
Boyle told you, didn't he?
Without any prompting. [Chuckles]
Welcome to your party.
All right. Whoo!
Does anyone have a few words they'd like to say?
Bup-bup. No one say anything.
I want him to say stuff.
Speech for Jake.
Speech for Jake. Go. Very well.
Your six-month absence was noted. Yes.
Drinks are on me.
There's a two-drink maximum per person. Ah, here he goes.
It is non-transferable. Uh-huh.
Your guests will pay their own tab. Oh, yeah.
Valet parking is not included. Solid protocol.
Tomorrow's briefing will be 15 minutes earlier than usual.
Wonderful. He's so bad at it. And...
I'm very proud of you, Peralta.
We missed you.
Aww, you ruined it.
To Jake. [All cheer]
Hey, got you a drink.
Thanks. What is this?
It's champagne mixed with 30-year-old scotch and top-shelf Tequila.
Captain said a two-drink Max.
But he did not set a price limit.
Smort. Hmm.
Oh, God. It's horrible.
Yeah, I shouldn't have added the olive juice.
Eww.
Hey, so listen, the thing I said to you before I went undercover, about how I wished something had happened between us romantically, that wasn't nothing. That was real.
What are you saying?
I know that you're with Teddy.
I'm not trying to change that.
And I get there's stuff I can't control.
But this morning I told you that I didn't mean any of it, and that was a lie.
I just don't want to hold anything back.
Well, thank you for saying that.
Just as long as we're clear that I'm with someone and nothing is gonna happen.
""I'm with someone, nothing's gonna happen""...
Name of your s*x tape. He's back.
[Chuckles]
Neat sweater. Ugh.
Did you tell Jake yet? Nope. Really?
You told him about his own surprise party.
Mm-hmm, first chance I got.
But I had tons of chances to tell him about what happened six months ago, and I didn't. Why not?
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Eww. Pump the brakes, Charles.
Because I'm terrified of you and what you'll do to me.
Oh, that's sweet.
Well, then.
Sound like our nightmare is finally over.
[Both scream]
What? [Both groan]
Not a doctor. Shh.

Terry: Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks, doctor.
Have a good one.
Hey there, sarge.
Not to pry but I couldn't help but overhear...
You're going to the doctor? Everything okay?
I'm getting a vasectomy.
My ears are burning. Did someone say ""vasectomy?""
I got snipped. No big deal.
Just numbs you out from trunk to skunk for a year.
It's not supposed to.
""Trunk to skunk""?
Hold it up.
You're gonna let some quack doctor just knife around down there?
You are blessed with a great power.
And you should never snip its wings.
You should let it soar.
Thanks guys, that's enough. I don't need anymore input.
Neither does your wife, I guess.
Look, you guys, if the sergeant wants to chop off his pen1s, that is his choice.
That's not what a vasectomy is.
If you guys don't get back to work, I'm gonna start firing detectives.
And blanks!
Sorry. I just never think of jokes.
Anybody else? This is your last chance.
Oh, God. No need to be so testes.
Guess you won't be manning the ""tip line.""
Sergeant, is this gonna go on your ""sperm-anent record""?
Now playing: ""Scrotal recall""!
♪ ♪
Hey sarge, great news.
I just got assigned such a dope stabbing.
Sorry, the stabbing part is bad.
But here's the dope part: The guy survived and he owns a chocolate milk restaurant.
Seriously? I know, right?
Finally, a dumb Brooklyn hipster trend my mouth and I can get behind.
Wanna hop on the case with me?
We're a killer team.
Jeffords and Peralta.
Jake and Terry.
Chocolate and milk.
I mean, I'm the chocolate and you're the milk 'cause you're so full of protein!
Don't be mad! Just do the case!
Okay, but I have my vasectomy today.
So I need to be back in a few hours to catch my ride to the doctor's.
My neighbor's driving me because my wife's out of town with the girls.
Why don't I drive you?
I don't know.
I guess I didn't really think of you as that kind of friend.
Sarge, I'm every kind of friend.
I'm Phoebe, I'm Chandler, I'm Rachel, I'm...
Who's the dinosaur guy?
Ross, bro! Ross!
Sorry, I forgot you were such a ross-head.
So look, we'll work this thing together and afterwards, I will be your friend chariot to the penis-removal of the century.
The new NYPD commissioner is planning a complete reorganization of the force.
But first, he'll be sending a deputy chief to every precinct to conduct a top to bottom evaluation.
What? When? Are we gonna be graded?
Or is this just some pass/fail garbage?
Scale of one-to-five.
That's how many letter grades there are.
Feels like they're just being weird using numbers instead of letters.
Yeah, they're being weird right now.
Boyle. Diaz.
I want the evidence room organized beyond reproach.
Santiago, when I greet the deputy chief, I want you there by my side to make a good impression.
No offense, but you are something of a teacher's pet.
None taken! People love their pets.
Good news is our evaluation will be done by deputy chief Brandt.
We have a good rapport. He was once my captain.
So he's kind of like our grand-captain.
That is amazingly funny.
Well, I was closing up around 11:00.
I heard the door open.
I just figured it was some ""milkers.""
That's what we call our regulars.
Do ya?
Anyway, next thing I know, the guy stabs me in the back like... like right here!
Like some kind of psycho wuss!
Can you think of anyone who might wanna harm you?
[Blows raspberries] Yeah.
I mean, you don't get into this line of business to make friends.
Really? I would think making chocolate milk is a great way to make friends.
I don't have proof, but the guy who did this to me is my business partner, Gregory Phillips.
He's still pissed at me because I banned him from my 'straunt.
He was supposed to be my silent partner, but he wasn't silent.
He was trying to control everything.
Here, try this.
All right, here we go. Finally!
Terry: All right.
Oh! Ugh! It's so bitter!
What's wrong with this chocolate milk?
Dark milk isn't chocolate milk.
[Gasps]
This is teat-to-mouth raw cow's milk.
The bitterness of the chocolate brings out the sourness in the milk.
That's the worst part of both of those things!
Uh, time for my appointment, Jake.
Yup, got it.
All right, we'll look into this and get back to you.
Okay, sarge.
Hate to be ""that kind of a friend,"" but let's go chop off that pen1s.
Where were you? This is chaos.
Gina's been filing evidence by ""perp hotness.""
I'm so sorry, I just got some bad news.
My sister was gonna go with me to an engagement party but she had to cancel.
So go alone. Maybe you'll meet some new bag.
It's my ex-wife Eleanor's engagement party.
I can't go alone.
I'm worried it might seem a little pathetic.
Yeah, if only you could've gone with your sister.
Dude, why are you going to your ex-wife's engagement party at all?
She and her fiance, Hercules, are also my landlords.
I mean, it's not like I can avoid them.
I live in their basement.
Hey!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? No.
You could go with me. Can't.
I have a date tomorrow night. Okay.
I will figure something out.
I know!
Maybe if I pay my neighbor, Joann, she'll ditch her wife for the night!
Captain, I don't know if this is too much but I got deputy chief Brandt this little basket of pears.
They look ripe and crispy.
Madeline Wuntch: Hello, Raymond.
Captain Wuntch. Good to see you.
But if you're here, who's guarding Hades?
It's deputy chief Wuntch now.
Unsurprisingly, I've been promoted above you.
And now I'm here to evaluate you.
Holt: What happened to Brandt?
He retired and moved to Charleston to be closer to his grandchildren.
So much for dying at your desk with a little dignity.
Interesting.
I will attempt to cooperate with you.
Under these new circumstances.
Don't sweet-talk me, Holt.
I gave it my best shot. Let's begin.
Hey, hey!
How'd it go?
Is his voice all high-pitched now?
What? No, of course not.
Of course not.
Jake!
The doctors made me into a superhero!
I am so strong!
[Gasps] And they made me black!
He's on a lot of medication.
We weren't able to do the procedure.
Your friend is so large...
That you needed a bigger saw to get through his dingus?
No, his body is so physically massive that we didn't have enough anesthesia on hand.
He needs a much larger dose.
Psst... psst... Jake.
Sometimes I can't tell my twin baby girls apart, so I call them both ""boo-boo.""
[Both laughing]
Wow. So he has no filter whatsoever?
None.
I'm gonna take ya home now, sarge.
Hey, what do you think of captain Holt?
He needs to smoke some weed.
Yes!
Thank you, Dr. Penis-off!
Okay, in ya go. You're okay.
Whoo! Cool!
Dude, your head is so small!
Like a...
No, no, it's so small!
All right.
Where do you keep your brains?
[Terry roaring]
Good.
All right, got your PJS on, read you a story, checked under the bed for monsters.
Check again!
And now it's sleepy-time, so here we go...
Wait, wait, wait...
You gotta promise me you won't let them give me the operation.
I wanna have more kids. I don't want the vasectomy.
Promise me, tiny head! Promise me!
All right, I promise! I promise.
Good!
Because I'm not done with my testicles yet.
Okay.
I'm gonna let them sing!
[Vocalizing operatically]
Uh-oh, walk of shame!
Same clothes as yesterday.
I slept at the sarge's.
It was horrible.
Come... here... Phone!
All right, let's get going and interview that suspect.
I have my make-up vasectomy this afternoon so...
I'm sorry, your what-what vasectomy?
Last night, you told me you didn't want that.
Then you fell on top of me and changed the shape of my skeleton forever.
No, I definitely want one.
That was the drugs talking. I was high as a kite.
Did I do this and call you ""tiny head?"" Yes.
Some things are coming back to me now.
Oh, that's great.
[Terry laughs] Tiny head.
Jake, I am so scared that man is about to make a huge mistake, re: His vas deferens.
I know, he made me promise to not let him get that surgery.
And it wasn't just the drugs. He doesn't want this.
As his friend, it's my job to stop him.
[Back cracks, groans in pain]
Sorry, Terry turned my spine into a loose stack of pebbles.
And since my arrival, violent crime has gone down by 17.3%, as you can see here.
Two-toned graphs?
You think you can distract me from the precinct's problems with a flashy presentation?
Same old Ray Holt.
All sizzle, no steak.
I'm off to do some spot-checks.
Oh, my God. She's totally gonna flunk us.
I haven't gotten an ""F"" since I failed recess in second grade.
""Teachers need a break too, Amy.""



We were doomed the minute she slithered into the precinct.
It's funny. When we first met, we had some good times.
Looks like we both want that stapler.
Seems that way based on what happened.
[Both laughing]
So when did it all go south?
1989. I was up for a big promotion, which would've fast-tracked my career.
Wuntch offered to write a letter on my behalf but instead, she torpedoed me because of something that happened the night before she was to turn it in.
Madeline.
Would you care for a drink?
I'd love one.
I'm sure you can tell I'm quite drunk.
I've had a couple to build up the nerve.
I think we both know what I'm about to say.
Raymond...
I don't think we need to say anything.
I'm gay.
That's what I was going to tell you.
Well, then.
She sabotaged my career because I refused to bed her.
He thinks I stabbed him? That's crazy.
He said you were furious at him because he banned you from the restaurant and called your business plans ""terrible.""
The text reads: ""Your ideas are dumb-dumb batter in a stupid pancake, you steaming pile of human fences.""
I assume that was auto-corrected from ""feces.""
Look, partners fight. He's difficult to work with, but I would never try and kill him.
Where were you on monday around 10:00 pm?
Me and my business school buddies get together every monday and have a couple beers.
Also, there's a... uh... Pilates studio with a huge window across the street so it's a pretty sweet view.
I guess that's not as bad as stabbing someone?
I left around 10:00, I took the subway home, got off at York street, around my house, puked on a statue, went to bed.
Classy. All right, well, we've taken up enough of your time enjoy the rest of your day and go back to your life as ""a pile of human fences.""
Okay, let's see if any of DRK MLK's neighbors saw the pilates perv or anyone else fleeing the scene of the crime.
Copy that.
We'll do some cop stuff, have a heart-to-heart about your vasectomy, cancel your vasectomy, grab some drinks, laugh about the time you almost got a vasectomy.
Stop worrying about my vasectomy, man.
Maybe you should focus on your own body.
When's the last time you had a carrot?
Well, it's my least favorite type of cake, so rarely.
If I absolutely have to, I'll just eat the frosting.
Hey! Cut it out, cake boy.
You're making health insurance more expensive for everyone else!
Yeah? Well, you know what else drives up premiums?
Unwanted genital removal!
[Door opens]
[Sighs in relief] Thank you for coming.
I wasn't sure if you'd get my message.
Charles, it was kind of hard to miss.
Oh, God!
Hey, I didn't know what to do.
You said we weren't allowed to talk at work now that we're knocking boots.
Ew, gross.
Listen, my ex-wife's throwing an engagement party this weekend and I was wondering if you wanted to go...
As friends.
No, Charles, just because we have secret, shameful s*x does not mean we are friends.
Forget friends. Let's go as ""bone bros.""
Ugh!
I didn't strike you when you said ""knocking boots,"" but ""bone bros""? I cannot abide.
Have you seen this man around DRK MLK.
Oh, I don't go there.
They don't allow babies in there.
What is wrong with them?
All I drank when I was a baby was chocolate milk.
Well, thank you for your time.
And thank you, adorable little baby, who's probably giving my partner some mixed feelings right about now.
""Don't get the operation, sarge!
Instead, make a tiny muscular friend for me to play with!""
That's enough.
I'm with you. That's enough, baby.
Mind your own business.
I haven't heard of DRK MLK and I've never seen this man before.
This is your lead? Why are we here?
Well, according to the lnternet, Dr. Mindel is the best couples counselor in the Park slope area, who accepts same day walk-ins.
Couples counseling?
Sorry for wasting your time.
Wait, please don't leave.
This cost me so much money. [Door closes]
I am so sorry.
He's walking out.
Just like your father did.
Wait a minute, I didn't tell you about that.
Didn't have to.
You are good!
Sarge, wait up! Come on, don't be mad!
Look, I'm only trying to protect you from your very stupid self.
That is enough, Jake!
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
And the things you said when you were whacked-out were real.
You made me promise. And as your friend...
I told you, Jake.
We're not that kind of friends.
Not what kind of friends?
""Friend"" friends.
You and I are work friends.
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm going to the doctor's office.
Not good enough.
Prepare to be physically overpowered by a ""friend"" friend.
Argh!
Cancel the appointment! I've got you!
You can't move.
Concede defeat, sir.
You have been conquered.
Madeline: Spot-checks are done.
Needless to say, I thoroughly underwhelmed.
Huh. From your expression, I would've guessed constipated or chilly.
Excuse me, captain, I don't want to say that I saved the day, but I will because I did.
So...
The letter of recommendation she wrote for you 25 years ago.
Where'd you get this?
I just went down to one police plaza and applied some of my signature Amy charm.
And then when you wouldn't stop, they just gave it to you?
More or less.
The point is, the letter's very positive.
You thought she wrote mean stuff about you because of the... Night before.
But she didn't. It was all a misunderstanding.
Madeline: Wait a minute...
You thought I cost you that promotion because you're gay?
That's what you've been mad about all these years?
It's... one reason.
I don't care that you rejected my advances.
Your sexual identity is the one thing I actually respect about you.
Then what are you mad about?
I'm mad because you tried to get me thrown off the force.
Yeah, because you shot me.
I shot you because you were in the wrong position.
You weren't following orders.
What about the time you destroyed my personnel file while I was undercover?
What if there had been a mole?
You were trying to make me disappear.
You embarrassed me in front of Derek Jeter!
You embarrassed yourself in front of Derek Jeter.
Charles: Hey, Rosa!
Better file me under ""E"" for ""edgy.""
What?
Cornrows!
Why?
My ex-wife and her fiance go to Jamaica all the time.
The theme of their party is: ""Jamaican me marry you.""
So good!
So...
I still don't have a date.
Unless this sweet maize-head has changed your mind.
I think we both know it hasn't.
We do. [Clears throat]
Fair enough.
[Exhales deeply]
Why do you look so terrible?
I tried to stop sarge from getting his tubes tied.
But he somehow managed to sneak off to the hospital.
Zip that lip! He's doing it?
He wouldn't listen to me. He said I was a ""work friend.""
Ah, that chills me. And it reminds me of a story.
I had this sweater, and it was a work sweater because it only seemed work apropes, but then one time, I wore it out to dinner and I was like, ""oh, dang!
This sweater is cute everywhere.""
I get it. I'm the sweater.
No.
And I have to show the sarge I can be a good friend to him outside of work too.
No!
Thank you, Gina.
I'm gonna stop him.
Jake, I have no idea what you're talking about, but good luck!
Well, good-bye, Raymond.
Anything you'd like to say to me before I complete my evaluation?
Something in the form of groveling?
Never. Fail me if you must.
You're just gonna let her fail us?
I'm sorry about your precious grade, Santiago, but this isn't about you.
Don't ""this isn't about you"" me!
I'm ""this isn't about you""-ing you!
That grade is the only thing standing between me and a future where you're not my captain anymore.
Wuntch failed the nine-oh and their captain was fired.
I attempted to cajole her but she rebuffed me.
I'm not a man of unlimited cajoling.
Well, you better become one because I need you in command.
This precinct needs you in command.
Cajole up, captain.
Sarge, hey!
What the hell are you doing here, tiny head?
You better not be trying to talk me out of my surgery again.
Look, I'm not trying to talk you out of anything.
I'm just here to give you a ride home and to prove to you once and for all that I'm more than just a work friend.
Thank you, microscope head.
Hey, a little bit of good news!
I figured out the case!
Remember Gregory said he got off at the York street station the night of the stabbing?
Well, I took the subway here and it's closed for construction.
Hmm...
So what you're saying is...
I stabbed him.
I did it.
You know what? We'll talk about it tomorrow.
See you on the other side.
Jake, you were right!
I don't want the surgery, Tiny Head!
NYPD!
Put down the scalpel and step away from my work friend's weiner-tubes!
Looking good, Boyle!
Ugh, that's not a good sign.
Hey, mon.
Rosa... You changed your mind!
I blew off my date, and instead, I'm going to spend a hellish evening in a Jamaican torture chamber with you.
Really? Yeah.
Here's what's about to happen.
We're gonna go to this terrible party, I'm gonna laugh at all your jokes, gonna talk about your medal of valor, and I'm gonna make you look like a Jamaican God of rhythm.
Sebastian from The Little Mermaid.
Also, tomorrow, I'm gonna help you find a new apartment.
You can't live in your ex-wife's basement anymore.
Wow! Respect, mon.
I'm gonna read you my toast in the car.
You're giving a toast?
More like we're giving a toast.
[Groans]
Jake: There we go.
Jake, I have to tell you something.
Oh, boy.
I am a little conflicted about having a vasectomy.
Really?
Is that why you threw an EKG machine at the doctor?
I'm sorry I thought of you as a work friend.
You're here, man. You're a friend friend.
You made Terry get real with himself and his genitals.
Your tiny head has a big heart inside it.
I know that's scientifically wrong, but thanks, sarge.
I'm gonna talk to my wife when she comes home.
You're a huggy good friend.
No! Not again.
Santiago, we received our grade.
Oh, my God. Is this good-bye?
There's still so much I have to say to you.
2.7. Mediocre.
But enough for you to stick around.
How did you get her to change her mind?
I had to compromise everything I stand for.
You are now, and always have been, the superior police officer.
And?
The Derek Jeter thing was my fault.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
No, you were right.
This is the best job I've ever had and it would be foolish to give it up over a petty feud.
Here, this is for you.
It's a grade for your performance these past few days.
A letter grade, so as to not be ""weird"" about it.
Oh, my God. You really shouldn't have.
An ""a.""
Thank you.
Just curious, does your system have pluses in it, or is, like, ""a"" the highest?
How'd the interrogation go?
Gregory confessed to the stabbing.
Nice work.
I just talked to my wife.
We're waiting on the operation, everything's cool.
Did you tell her we slept together twice?
Thanks for taking care of me. I got you a present.
Do you know what a present is, Terry?
I care about my friends.
Now eat your carrots, or I'll rip your tiny head off.
No! No! No!
Come here.
[Gags]
I hate being friends with you!

Ugh, motorcade duty.
So boring.
I honestly would rather sit around and listen to you talk about the right way to make paella.
There's more than one right way to make paella, Jake.
There are ten right ways.
You got classic Valencian, modern...
No, wait, stop. I changed my mind.
I've made a horrible mistake.
Hey, Rosa, just who I was looking for.
Quick question, can I have your friend Katie's phone number?
I want to ask her out.
No, I don't mix personal and professional.
You're never getting her number.
Never like, ""we're never gonna have a black President"" never?
'Cause that happened.
A real never.
Like if you ever ask me about this again, you're never gonna be able to eat without a straw.
Yeah, okay, well... you are on the wrong side of history, my friend.
Katie, huh?
Wow, I can't believe you're not still pining for Amy.
I mean, I pine for years.
I still think about Mia, the nurse that helped my nana pass.
Yes, I know.
You've told me, like, a hundred times about the time your nana collapsed and accidentally pulled Mia's pants down.
Best day of my life.
I don't have feelings for Amy anymore.
So time for me to get out there and spread my w...
Legs.
Get out there and spread my legs?
Well, e-either way.
No, not either way. Only wings.
♪ ♪
Holt: Listen up.
There's been an issue with the motorcade.
The Serbian President is delayed in Washington, and we can't start locking down intersections until he takes off.
Apparently he's on an important call with the Albanian President.
Is that Bujar Nishani or is it still Bamir Topi?
Oh, Ames, let me check.
Hmm, it just says no one likes you.
There's a three-hour delay, minimum.
Captain Holt and I will have to leave for a meeting at I Police Plaza.
You should all stay prepped and ready.
Holt: Dismissed.
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Three-hour delay with no Holt or Terry?
Do you have any idea what this means?
Makeovers. No, Charles.
The Jimmy Jab games!
All: Yeah!
The first Jimmy Jabs were held in 2008, when the King of lraq...
President, Iran. Armen Jimmy Jab.
Ahmadinejad. Came to New York, and were on call for nine glorious hours in case there were protests.
On that day, a young genius named Jake Peralta used the last piece of his bagel to create the first Jimmy Jab event.
The monster mouth bagel toss.
[Whispered] Oh.
And the rest was history.
As soon as Holt and Terry leave, we will commence with Jimmy Jab seven, circus of fools.
Jimmy Jabs...
All: Jimmy Jabs.
Jimmy Jabs. Jimmy Jabs.
Jimmy Jabs! Jimmy Jabs!
Jimmy Jabs!
Seems like we're ready for our meeting with deputy chief Wuntch.
Is that how you plan on sitting?
Leaning back like a matinee-goer?
Madeline will eat you alive.
That's no better.
Hands folded on your lap like a pervert.
Sir, what are you so nervous about?
There's a new drug in the precinct, and we need updated narcotics field kits.
All we're asking for is $1,200.
How could she say no to that?
Sergeant, as long as I'm asking for it, Madeline Wuntch can say no to anything.
[Sneezes]
Ugh, may I?
Those are my tissues, Raymond.
If you were planning on sneezing, you should have brought your own.
Sir, she's a deputy chief.
I'm sure she wants what's best for the community.
She doesn't care about the community.
She only cares about defeating me.
This is war, sergeant.
The war on Wuntch.
Oh, good. You've named it.
So Jimmy Jabs, huh?
What do you say we make it interesting this year?
Aha! We could play for Katie's number.
No.
Is this why you wanted to do Jimmy Jabs?
No. Yes. Why? What gave it away?
You said, ""aha"" and snapped your fingers.
Ah.
Oh, you wanna go out with Rosa's friend Katie?
That's great. She's cool.
I know, but Rosa has this dumb rule about not mixing work with personal stuff.
That's actually not a bad policy.
I once gave my aunt a jaywalking ticket, and things really deteriorated between us.
Hmm.
But Jake and Katie would be awesome together.
I know, right?
She's single. I'm single.
She's pretty. I'm pretty.
So it's settled.
If I win the Jimmy Jabs, you give me her number.
And if I lose, you don't have to give it to me.
I already don't have to give it to you.
All right, I'll give you $200, and I'll never ask you for another phone number again.
Done.
Hello, Gina.
It's daylight, Boyle. Why are we talking?
This is an emergency.
I've been filming my fitness routine with the precinct camera to help improve my form.
That's where I got these tree trunks.
But I realized that I left the tape in the camera, and now it's gone.
[Sing-song] Who cares?
Who cares? Who cares?
You probably will.
[Groaning]
Oh, Boyle, I love that you're trying to step up your s*x game.
But strength is not your issue.
Stop humming.
And it does not turn me on when you bend over and back up into me.
Did someone check out the camera this morning?
Yes, Hitchcock.
And if he sees it, he will tell everyone.
You need to get that damn tape.
Okay.
We're off.
You'll get word when the Serbian President is wheels-up.
You got it, sarge.
We'll just be here till you get back.
Calmly and respectfully prepping.
All right, they're gone!
Ceremonial bagel.
Flask.
Flame.

Let the games begin.
[All cheering]
[Imitates trumpet call]
Welcome to the Jimmy Jabs.
We play for pride.
We play for the phone numbers of Rosa's friends.
But most importantly, we play to watch Amy lose.
Nope. This is my year.
It's my year too.
Please don't align yourself with me.
Why not?
Neither of you have ever come close to winning.
You're exactly the same, just a couple of Santiagos.
[Laughter]
But the real prize is the Winchester 3000, the only chair in the precinct with minimal staining, good lumbar support, and no broken rolly-wheels.
Over to you, Gina.
Thank you, Jake.
Okay, guys, as usual, the loser of each event is eliminated from the games.
The winner gets a bonus in the final round.
Our first event is...
""The mouthathon.""
In front of you is month-old Chinese food from the fridge.
Go ahead and eat as much as you can stomach.
On your mark, get set, Wahlberg!
[Groans]
Ugh!
I can't do this to my mouth.
She's the love of my life.
Charles is eliminated.
Ugh, I think this ball of soup is off.
I'm out!
I can do this.
I wanna win so bad.
Oh, great. Here, quick. Let me take a picture.
Oh, that's so cute.
You've got a little bit of mold on the tip of your nose.
[Spits]
I tried. I tried, but he's unbeatable.
You guys know this is free, right?
Hello, Deputy Chief Wuntch.
You've aged.
Stay seated. We can do this out here, since you've already made yourselves comfortable.
Sergeant Jeffords, why don't you just lie down?
I can't sit any straighter than this.
We're here about a new and very potent form of ecstasy, which has surfaced in our precinct.
Street name, giggle pig.
Hmm, an embarrassing blight growing right under your nose.
Not unlike that moustache you had when we first met.
That moustache was era-appropriate.
The precinct just needs updated field kits to help us combat the problem.
This paperwork is a mess.
A semicolon that should clearly be a full colon?
Was this prepared by a recent immigrant?
It's just one typo.
It's gibberish.
Request denied.
Wow. You were right.
All it took was one mistake.
You think that semicolon was a mistake?
No, it was a juicy piece of bait, and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.
So you wanted her to say no to us?
Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason, that's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.
I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, chief Fisker.
You wanna hear the funniest thing ever?
I also split and infinitive, and she didn't notice.
[Laughs]
Charles: Hey, buddy.
Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?
Yeah, I was gonna take it home and videotape the top of my head.
I think I might be thinning up there.
Cool, cool.
So I accidentally left a tape in there, and I want it back.
Why? What's on it?
Nothing.
I just really need it for no reason.
Well, if you want that tape back, I gotta get something in return.
Are you blackmailing me?
I don't have any money, Hitchcock.
I'm still paying my uncle's funeral bills.
I rear-ended the hearse. It was a mess.
There's one thing I want, and it's not that big.
I just want you to make me cool in everyone's eyes.
Not that big?
The Jimmy Jabs has claimed its first victims.
Boyle, you made no impact.
Also, Detective Scully has withdrawn due to food poisoning, which I think we all saw coming.
All right, the second event is ""bulky bulky run run,"" the bomb suit foot race.
Sure hope I don't sprain my arm during the face, 'cause I'm gonna be opening up a lot of doors for Katie on our date.
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a gentleman.
What are you doing, Jake?
Trash talking you, while simultaneously proving that I will be respectful of your friend.
It's a tough line to walk.
[Inhales] Gotta loosen up my flower-buying fingers.
I'm gonna go nuts on the daisies.
On your mark...
Get set...
Ruffalo!



[Rock music]
Go!
Hitchcock: I'm doing it, Charles!
I look cool!
Whaaow!
[Thud]
The next event will be ""keep your cover.""
Contestants must craft an undercover persona and talk to as many police officers as you can before being recognized.
Pregnant. Nice.
Means ya had s*x.
Damn right, I did. And I forgot my birth control.
Yeah!
Yah!
I think the belly will draw attention away from my face.
Smart. Like one big boob.
Mm-hmm.
Jake will go first, then Amy, then Rosa.
On your mark, get set,
Paul Gosselaar!
Please let me have the tape.
No dice.
I don't know how to make you cool.
I'm not even that cool myself.
I mean, sure, I have a pizza stone.
You have cool friends.
Like Jake.
I just wanna be part of a conversation where Jake uses my name and nobody insults me.
Damn it! You ask too much.
Ahh.
I blew it.
I only got through two people.
He's kicking so much. You wanna feel?
No! That's a bad idea!
Oh, my baby! It's on the side!
Oof. I got to six.
Dumb baby!
People are right... They ruin everything!
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! I wanna try.
Let me be pregnant.
Whoop!
Adorable.
Right?
I can't believe I lost again!
I was so psyched up for this. What happened?
Well... maybe being so psyched up is what happened.
Like every time we're doing police work, you're always super-smart and you stay calm and take your time, but every time we do dumb games like this, you get all frantic and act like a crazy idiot.
My advice... next time don't act like a crazy idiot.
Thanks. That's surprisingly insightful.
Yeah, well, motherhood...
Really opens a man's eyes.
I finally feel as if I'm part of something bigger than myself.
All right.
Too much?
Yeah.
Peralta. What the hell?
Where were you? I got eliminated.
[Dainty voice] 'Scuse me, officer.
Yes, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?
Seriously, Hank? Is that how you talk to women who come in here?
Jimmy Jabs.
I didn't even make it past one person.
You're out? I'm in the finals?
And all I have to do to get Katie's number is beat Amy? Oh, that's nothing.
Hey! Don't you dare touch Amy Junior.
[Gasps] That's right.
It's your baby!
Are you sayin' I knocked you up?
You sure did! [Sobbing]
Jake.
Hmm?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure thing. Hold that.
Sure.
Rosa: All right, Jake...
You wanna call off the bet?
Seriously? You're gonna back out now just 'cause you're losing?
What is this, a riverboat casino on the river of no rules?
No. I'm giving you a chance to call off the bet because it's clear you don't actually want Katie's number because you're still into Amy.
What? That's crazy. I just spent the whole day fighting for another girl's number.
Tsk. You spent the whole day flirting with Amy.
Yeah, we're joking around because we're friends now that I've moved on.
Then prove it.
Beat Amy and don't flirt with her at all.
Fine. Easy. But you better tell Katie to clear her schedule out Thursday for a date, 'cause I am working nights until then, and the following weekend, I am out of town.
Let's do this!
Hey, Jake. Question for ya.
When I beat you, which victory dance should I do?
This one?
Or this one?
Oh, wow, okay.
Both are examples of victory dances.
No comeback?
After I burned you with those moves?
You must be pretty nervous.
Yep.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Charles.
Who's this with me?
Hitchcock?
Well, we should go now.
[Hitchcock laughing] Wow!
What a high!
Do you guys feel this way all the time?
I did what you wanted. Give me the tape.
Oh, no, we're not done yet.
Next, I want you to tell everyone you think I'm handsome.
Make it seem natural.
You are a monster!
So they're calling the drug ""giggle pig""?
Chief Fisker.
Sergeant Jeffords. Raymond.
Deputy Chief Wuntch.
I didn't realize you'd be attending.
I can tell.
You have more of a fly-catching gape than usual.
I've examined his proposal.
There's no proof that giggle pig is a serious problem.
So we're just supposed to wait until it turns into an epidemic?
You're like The League of Nations in '36...
Just hoping the Abyssinian crisis resolves itself.
That's the lesson you draw from the fall of Addis Ababa?
Raymond, you sound so naive.
And you sound just like Victor Emmanuel III.
I have no idea who's winning.
I am.
Captain Holt, how serious a threat do you really think giggle pig poses?
Very serious.
Or it could be nothing.
Or it could be the new crack.
The new crack?
And you only need $1,200 to fight it?
Well, in an ideal situation, we would attack the problem with a lot more fire power, perhaps even a task force.
That makes sense. Let's make it happen.
Terry: That was amazing!
We got a task force!
More importantly, Wuntch got served.
Oh, my God.
Wuntch sounds like lunch.
Now, this opens up so many new avenues...
You got your task force.
I'm surprised.
That's funny, after 20 years, I'd think you'd be used to me slam-dunking in your face.
I'm surprised you didn't see what was going on in there.
I got you riled up, you oversold giggle pig, and now you're running an expensive task force in a time of budget cuts.
You better make some big arrests... and quick, or you'll be the poster boy for departmental waste.
Slam dunk... returned.
Not if we make those arrests.
3-point dunk.
You guys really don't know enough about basketball to be doing this.
Join hands, one and all, for we have reached the final event of the Jimmy Jabs... the obstacle course.
Good luck. You're gonna need it.
[Laughs]
[Woodenly] Yes. We all need luck.
Thank you for offering me some.
On your mark, get Seth...
Rogen!
Woman: Go, Amy!
Gina: Contestants must make it past the barricade hurdles then use a bean bag gun to get a snack.
Ah!
You will eat the snack in its entirety.
Ah!
Mmm!
[Overlapping yelling]
Come on... Close, close, close, close!
Ah!
Ugh!
Next, head down to the first floor where you will locate a pamphlet about bullying.
Then print out a picture of me using a laptop from 1982 whoever grabs their printout first is the winner!
Aah!
Surprise twist!
Aah!
What are you doing, Santiago?
Go!
Jake: Aah! You're burning my skin!
No broken rolly wheels!
I did it! I took my time, I wasn't a crazy idiot, and I won!
I finally ♪ wo-on ♪
♪ Oh, yeah ♪
Yes! Ye...
What's going on here?
Someone answer him now!
Santiago!
Peralta!
Boyle?
Hitchcock is very handsome.
Why, thank you, Boyle.
No one has anything to say?
Captain, what you just saw was the Jimmy Jab games.
It's a bunch of dumb contests we play to kill the time.
Nobody even cares who wins.
I won!
It's stupid, but we like it.
Clean this up. Now.
Boyle, I'm ready to take this to the next stage.
You're gonna pierce my ear... wait.
What are you doing in my locker?
I can't do this. I can't make you look cool.
Because you're afraid that Jake and I are gonna cut you out.
Well, you're not wrong.
I'm gonna find that tape.
You think I'd just leave something that valuable lying around?
I got it on me.
Oh!
Gimme that tape!
Ah! Gimme that tape!
Jake! Help me!
Ugh! Ah!
Uhh! Ugh!
The Serbian President's plane is wheels up.
Report to your motorcade positions immediately.
Let's go!
Hey, you gave it a good try.
Sorry you lost.
No. It's for the best.
I let Amy win.
Close, close, close, close!
Ah!
Oh!
You're right. I'm not over her.
Boyle, get out. I need to talk to Jake.
Okay. Bye!
I warmed up the seat.
Ugh, he did warm up the seat.
It's like a fire pit.
Look, if you're here for your $200, can I interest you in a check that will definitely bounce?
No. You will pay me in cash.
Ok.
[Gulps]
Look, I thought I was over Amy, but clearly I'm not, you know?
I'm as frustrated as you are.
I'm not frustrated.
But I am not enjoying this.
It is not like you to get hung up on a girl.
I don't know what to do.
You call Katie. That's what you do.
Only way to move on is to move on whether you think you're ready to or not.
Gotta get out there, man.
All right.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Are you okay, sir?
I don't want to sound dramatic, but today has been sub-optimal.
That doesn't leave this office.
Muntch beat me.
The squad was a disaster.
And in the end, you know who I'm angriest with?
Yourself?
No. Muntch.
I need this task force to succeed, and there's not a Detective here who's adult enough to lead it.
Peralta and Santiago were cowards, Diaz was disrespectful, and I just saw Hitchcock and Boyle fighting like children.
Get off... Get off me!
Hitchcock... Gimme that tape!
You're squeezing my boobs!
Sir, I know you think Rosa disrespected you, but I found her inspiring.
She did what I should have done...
Stand up and tell you the truth.
And what truth is that?
First, everyone else made this Wuntch-lunch connection instantly.
Second, Wuntch didn't beat you.
She saddled me with this task force.
You think she's consumed with pettiness?
You're no better.
Yes, the task force is risky, but it gives us a chance to do a lot of good in the community.
Sir, if you ask me, you're acting like a real Victor Emmanuel III.
You used that insult completely incorrectly.
But...
I suppose I have let Madeline... distract me from our purpose.
Which is why I think Rosa should lead the task force.
There's no B.S. with her.
Agreed.
Thank you, sergeant.

That was mine.

No. It was boring.
Mmm. Well, thanks for getting the tape back.

Attention, boys and ghouls.
Nope.
Every Halloween, I dress up in an amazing costume, and you never get what I am.
No, we get what you are...
An adult man who enjoys dress-up.
Very funny, Rosa.
This year, that won't be a problem because you're gonna pick my costume.
[All grumble]
Uh, Ms. Pac-man's nipple.
No, that's brown.
Why would you know that?
To be or not to be!
Not to be.

Oh, hey there, Captain.
Just curious, do you happen to know what today is?
Well, based on the fact that yesterday was the birthday of legendary Dutch flautist Frans Bruggen, and a week ago it was october 24th, it's say today is...
It's Halloween. Just say it's Halloween.
It's Halloween.
All right, and what happened last Halloween?
Oh, I listened to the CD I bought the night before, the Frans Bruggen birthday concert.
Please stop saying Bruggen.
Last year, you bet me that you could steal my medal of valor.
And you did.
Consequently, I was forced to do your paperwork for a week and to say words I thought I'd never have to say.
Jake Peralta is an amazing detective/genius.
But now it's time for round two of our Halloween bet.
This year, I believe I'll make things more difficult for myself.
Let's say, what, I'll steal the watch right off your wrist.
Or we could just not do it at all this year.
What?
Sir, with all due respect, come on, homey! No?
It's not worth all the trouble, just so you might call me an amazing captain/genius and give me one week of overtime for free.
All right, fine, I'll double the overtime.
I'll triple it!
I'll quadruple it!
I will five-druple it.
I'll five-druple the overtime.
Got his attention.
He's coming back to me.
Just to clarify.
If you steal my watch by midnight, I will do your paperwork for a week, but if you fail, you will give me five weeks of overtime for free.
Correct.
I'm doing a cost-benefit analysis in my head.
The benefits outweigh the costs.
We have reached an accord.
Accords!
Handing out these safety pumpkins to neighborhood kids is a cornerstone in community relations.
And putting them together is a boring-stone in testing my patience.
We can use an assembly line so it'll go quicker.
Ooh, that's a great idea, Terrence.
However, is there any way I can skip doing that and instead, not do that?
I have an urgent matter to attend to.
Okay, no problem.
Just come back and help us when you're done.
Thank you.
I'll leave you guys with this.
One-duhl plus one-duhl equals... Tootles.
[Chuckles]
Seriously, sarge? You're just gonna let her go?
Look, a year ago, I would've been thinking the same thing, but I've learned to give her the benefit of the doubt.
What kind of urgent matter could Gina possibly have to attend to?
She's already checked herself out in every reflective surface around the precinct.
Amy: Including my lip gloss.
She said she looked better when I frowned.
I was behind the door!
Greetings, comrades, and welcome to the most important briefing of your lives.
As you all know, the Holt-Peralta Halloween bet has been made, and the clock doth tick.
What's with the tux?
I decided to class up this year's event.
I bought it off a disgraced magician, and it is chock-full of scarves.
What? How?
A real magician never tells, young man.
Now, let's get started.
I've been planning this for three months.
You've all been given a specific role and a code name.
Rosa, you're the dagger.
Sarge, the hammer.
Amy, the hall monitor.
Yeah, suck it!
Scully and Hitchcock, I'm just gonna call you your real names so you don't get confused.
Smart.
What?
And, Boyle, as requested, you will be the deuce.
Although I still think you should reconsider that code name.
Nope, deuce.
It's like ace, but twice as cool.
It is not. It's a turd.
Now, because of last year, the captain will suspect that you are all helping me, so we will never get anywhere near his watch, but the actual theft will be pulled off by Dan McCreary, aka ""fingers.""
How you doing?
Call me ""fingers.""
Hey, I remember this guy.
That's probably because you've arrested him twice for pickpocketing.
You have a criminal helping you?
That's crazy!
Grow up, Amy.
Now, we will all work together as a team to move the captain into position.
Once there, fingers... Loving that code name...
Will remove the captain's watch and replace it with this replica watch.
Oh, that is a very dead dove.
Ooh!
All right...
This replica watch.
Jake, if he's been arrested before, how do you know he's any good?
Perhaps this will answer your question.
Fingers!
Whoa.
That's our stuff.
My croissant.
But where's the smoked Turkey?
Check your breast pocket?
Come on!
[Gasps]
Jake: Let's win this bet!
[Clears throat]
Salutations, Captain.
I was wondering perchance if you would like to attend the opera with me this Eve.
I'll pass, choosing instead to stay in my locked office with my watch still safely on my wrist.
I had a feeling you might say that.
Thusfore, I have decided to bring the opera to you.
Hitchcock, Scully!

Holt: Sir, sir.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted somebody to check my son's candy.
Please, let me help you up.
On behalf of the nine-nine, I apologize.
Jake: Fingers has grabbed the package.
I didn't mean for that to sound so dirty.
I'll have someone check your son's bag of candy immediately.
Clark.
Thank you, sir.
If you need anything, please, contact me.
I'll do that. Thank you.
Jake: The replica is on the wrist.
Game over.
I know all this was done in the spirit of a friendly bet, but this all went too far.
Am I understood?
Peralta!
Yes, sir.
Completely understood, sir. I'm sorry.
But not as sorry as you're going to be at midnight, when you realize you've lost everything.
Hello there, Hank.
I believe a tall, nimble-fingered man named McCreary left a package for me.
Yeah, it's here. Give me a sec.
Thanks.
Ooh, I'm gonna make a movie of you receiving the watch.
Here.
Let me pinch your lips and make fulsome.
Don't touch my face.
Fine, but if you have dull lips, that's on you.
This is Charles Boyle for Jake Action News.
Thank you.
Okay, open the box.
Here we go!
That's weird, it's just a note.
""Thanks for the watch""?
Oh, no!
McCreary stole the captain's watch!
Breaking news, there's been a terrible development.
Not now, Charles.
Good call. Media blackout.
We're okay. It's not over yet.
I still have two hours to find fingers and get Holt's watch back.
But how? He could be anywhere.
He could be in Canada by now.
There are so many forests up there.
That country is one giant hiding place.
Boyle, I kinda need you to be positive right now, okay?
Yes, sorry. Damn my mouth.
All right, let's look up McCreary's arrest records, past addresses, known associates.
Peralta.
[Whispered] Run, deuce, run.
If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to...
Make urines in de toilet.
Yeah, that's how people say words.
I'd like to ask a favor.
Can we please press pause on this bet for ten minutes?
Sure, or we could press fast-forward, and I could watch you talk like a chipmunk.
[Imitating chipmunk] Peralta, I'm very disappointed in you.
Yes, that would be very funny.
How do you ruin everything?
Kevin is bringing dinner for me, and I don't think he'd appreciate this bet we made.
This watch was given to me by his father just before he died.
Oh! A death watch, cool.
Please, never call it that.
Copy that. [Cell phone vibrates]
Oh, you know what?
You can have the ten minutes, no problem.
Love you, bye.
Boyle, fingers just texted.
He said he wants to meet up.
Yes. Let's get outta here.
Be cool. Holt's watching.
Pretend I just said something really funny.
[Both laugh]
Get outta here.
We gotta go.
Enjoy the vest and the light.
[Spooky voice] You'll be so safe, it's scary.
Lame.
That kid gets it.
Thanks for finally joining us, Gina.
We had to stuff 400 of these things without you.
Great seeing you guys.
Unfortunately, I cannot stay long.
I just came to grab a healthy snack.
Got it.
I'm still tending to that urgent matter I was talking about earlier.
Which is what exactly?
Hmm, funny you should ask, you inquisitive litter ferret.
I've been practicing my dance moves.
♪ If you wanna be with me ♪
♪ Baby there's a price ♪
My dance troupe, Floorgasm, is performing tonight in the boooo-ty shake grand prix.
Gina, what the hell?
I defended you, and your urgent matter was just practicing for some stupid dance show?
Look, I can't help it if my life is literally a Step Up movie.
Oh, is it?
Then I suggest you think of this moment as the montage where you buckle down and take your job seriously so your boss doesn't kill you.
Fine, then I suggest you figure out how to turn on all these sprinklers 'cause I'm about to tell a story.
Okay, fingers wants us to meet him in that alley over there.
What's the playbook, Jakey?
Well, he left me that note in the bar to try and scare me.
But it only made me angry.



We go in hard and tough and take what's rightfully ours.
I want $300.
Absolutely, no problem.
Whatever you need.
I happen to not have any money on me though.
Charles, do you have any cash?
Um, I have $120, and my lucky $2 bill that I found on my first day of kindergarten.
Okay, so that's $122.
And I want your shoes.
What? Fine.
Here. Take my shoes.
Can I please have the watch now?
You already have it. You had it all along.
What? What are you talking about?
I put it in the glove compartment of your car.
Think I'm gonna walk around with a stolen police captain's watch?
I'm not an idiot.
Great. Well, I would say thank you, but even for a criminal your customer service has been abysmal.
My pleasure. Have a good night.
Let's get back to the precinct and win this bet.
Jake! Jake, your car!
No! Ow, glass.
No!
Ugh, syringe.
Jake, you parked in front of a hydrant.
Stupid fire department.
We gotta think of a way to catch up with that truck.
Oh! How 'bout this?
Yes.
Hop in.
[Groans]
Go!
We're doing it, Boyle.
We're Tokyo drifting.
Jake: Gah, I can't see the tow truck anymore.
Charles, how come you're so much slower than a car?
I'm just trying not to jostle you too much.
You're the champagne of friends.
Look, there's a bar up ahead.
Maybe we can get a cab up there.
There's still time to get that watch.
All right. [Groans]
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Shoeless cop coming through.

That's a bad attitude.
I love that.
Look, I didn't want you to know because it's so off-brand for me, but I'm missing rehearsals because I've been going to college at night.
I'm trying to finish my bachelor's degree or whatever.
Really? That's great, Gina.
I'm so proud of you.
And while I generally nail everything, I'm just having trouble balancing my studies and my passion for dance.
Plus, you're working full-time.
Yeah, that actually doesn't factor into it whatsoever.
Anyway, it doesn't matter, because I'm never gonna dance again.
The world just lost an angel.

I'm not gonna let those losers punish you for doing something good.

You guys towed my car, and I really need it back.
Mm-hmm.
Got a badge?
Yeah, I sure do.
What?
D'oh, my badge!
Those demons on the party bus must have stolen it.
If you got a license and credit card, just pay to get it out.
Oh, great. Thank you.
Finally, something goes right.

I don't have my I.D. or my credit cards, but I really need that car.
Please, I'm begging you.

I can still win.
No!
No!
Noooo!
Freeze! Don't move!
Oh, my God.
There is a tiny chance I may not win this bet.
Talk now!
You seem upset.
Well, here's how the story goes.
Remember that little Halloween bet that we made?
You probably don't even remember, it was so early this morning.
Anywhoozle, it turns out the criminal I hired to lift your watch was not trustworthy, and I ended up contracting tuberculosis of the foot and subsequently losing your death watch.
But in the end, I like to think this whole thing is gonna bring us closer together.
And isn't that what it's really all about?
Merry Christmas!
What are you saying?
My watch is right here.
No, I made a switch. That's a fake.
No.
This one's a fake.
What?
No.
What?
No.
What?
No.
You were behind all this?
You played me.
Like Frans Bruggen plays the flute.
But how?
I've been planning this this theft for three months.
I know, but I've been planning it for a year.
Last Halloween, after you won the bet, I went back to my office to do everyone's paperwork, but I did no paperwork.
I started to plot my revenge.
I began by creating a word cloud.
But how could you possibly have known I was gonna try and steal your watch?
I knew you would try to take something important to me.
During the year, I drew your attention to my watch.
You're eight minutes late.
You're 14 minutes late.
You're three minutes early... In Chicago.
You annoyed me into stealing it.
Exactly.
Now you had a target, but you needed a plan.
Fortunately, it walked through the door, handcuffed to Diaz.
This scumbag pickpocket is Dan McCreary.
He can take anything off of anyone.
Anything?
Anyone?
Holt: The look on your face, priceless.
I put McCreary into my employ immediately.
Fast-forward to this morning.
You commenced your plan.
McCreary stole my watch, and then replaced it with the replica.
And while you celebrated, McCreary put my watch back in my pocket.
The watch never left my person.
Dun-dun-duh!
I can see that you're enjoying this.
Not nearly as much as I enjoyed phase two.
Phase two.
While you met with McCreary, Santiago placed a fire hydrant in front of your car, which she then towed away.
Next, I had to take Charles out of the equation.
He had a badge and a gun, and he would do anything to help you.
Enter a parade of drunks that separated the two of you long enough for Terry to kidnap Charles.
Then two bears spilled their drinks on you and stole your wallet.
Those bears? Scully and Hitchcock.
I can't pull my head off!
If Terry kidnapped Charles, how did Charles tell me to get on the party bus?
Eight months ago at a morning briefing, I told the squad that a group of thieves was targeting party busses, so I could record Charles saying...
Jake, party bus! Toot toot!
Get on board!
I knew Boyle would never knowingly betray me.
With your jacket and shoes gone, you didn't look like a cop, but you still had your badge.
That is, until you entered the party bus.
Holt: Rosa's feline dancing distracted you as a mysterious partier stole your badge on...
Halloween!
It was you in the mask!
Jake: You sly son of a bitch!
Well done.
But I do have to ask, those guys at the impound, did they really smash my car?
No, in fact, I had them wash it.
[Chuckles] Good one, Captain.
You can't ""wash a car.""
So how'd you convince the whole squad to betray me?
What'd you offer them?
I asked them if they wanted to embarrass you, and they instantly said yes.
I'm not gonna lie, that turns me on a little bit.
Hmm.
So in addition to the five weeks of free overtime, I believe I'm owed one more thing.
Yes. Here we go.
One second.
[Cheering]
Very well.
Captain Raymond Holt...
Mm-hmm.
You are an amazing police captain/genius.

But be warned, I started planning next year's heist just this minute.

Oh, you guys are probably curious about this.

My car's in the shop, so I rode in on Rosa's motorcycle.
I guess you could say I'm a gear head now.
He held on to me so tight, it was like a two-mile Heimlich.

Apparently, someone has been leaking classified information to a criminal syndicate.

Wow, you are really worried about this investigation.
Okay, fine.
I promise I will be stone-cold serious in my interview.

No.

The good news is I can be brief about it.
We have nothing.
Sorry. I had to talk my twins into getting their hair done.
There are some promises involving lollipops I do not intend to keep.
The task force has made some busts.
But we still haven't found any high-level dealers or major drug stashes.
But we will soon.
Is that a promise?
Or just another lollipop that no one's ever gonna lick?
Wuntch is waiting for this task force to fail.

It's my spy voice.
[Hoarsely] Car, initiate ghost mode.
That's a seat warmer.
Oh, that's even better than rockets.
My butt gets very cold.
It's Gina's phone.
Leave me a voice-mail.
I won't check it 'cause it's not 1993.
We should go there anyways.
Her phone's probably off 'cause of dance rehearsal.
God, this I.A.B. guy is ruining my life.
But I do have some good news in three, two...
Pocket donut!
No!
It's everywhere.
Backup.
Gina, open up.
[Muffled pop music playing]
Well, luckily, I still have a key from when I lived here.
Mm.
Ah!
Here we go.
[Both gasping]
Both: Oh, my God!
[All screaming]
Oh, God!
What is going on?
Gina and I are casual lovers.
[Both groan]
Ew.
How long has this been going on?
Gina: We hooked up once, last summer and then the nightmare started again about a month ago.
Ever since then, it's been orgasm-city.
[Both groan]
Ew!
Yuck, gross. Right, guys?
Wait a minute.
You lied to me?
There was no ""pizza for one"" cooking class tonight.
You've been lying to me for weeks!
Oh, I can't tonight.
I'm teaching inner city kids to make candles.
Oh, sorry.
I'm going to a prenatal yoga class.
No can do, going to my adult tumbling class.
Yes, Jake, those were lies.
But the way you looked at me when you thought I was a gymnast made me wish it were true.
You came into work with chalk on your hands, Boyle.
I don't even know you anymore.
I'm leaving.
I just gotta get some old case files first.
Don't be mad, Jake. You still know me.
I'm still Charles.
I just have four extra s*x moves.
Five... forgot about ""boy on top.""
Ugh.

Rosa: Terry!
Terry.
I can't believe they call this a ""silent disco.""
This is not a disco.
And I should know. I was raised on disco.
[Rose Royce's car wash playing]
Little Terry loved the hustle.
Excuse me, can I get a bottle of water?
Good move.
Giggle dehydrates the hell out of you.
Yeah, I don't do that stuff.
I don't even drink.
Hey, your shirt.
My daughters go to the learning grove.
Did you get that from a vintage store or something?
No, I went there.
I was in the dolphins class.
And you don't do drugs or drink.
Have a water on the house.
Well, she was useless.
Not entirely.
I learned that my babies are on the right track because their pre-school turns out nice kids.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Holt that at the task force meeting.
Now let's go look for some bad kids who went to sub-par pre-schools.
That was insane.
I mean, who else is hooking up that we don't know about?
Rosa and Terry? Holt and Scully?
You and Hitchcock?
You need to forget about Charles, okay?
You need to get inside and put those files back.
Wait, wait, wait. Why'd I get Hitchcock?
Because you're the girl version of him.
Thanks again for all your help.
Okay, bye.
Wha...
Hey, captain.
Mind if we sit?
Is everything okay?
Nothing's okay.
Wuntch... Circling me like a shark frenzied by chum. The task force, turning into a career-threatening quagmire.
An lnternal Affairs investigation casting doubt upon my integrity.
And you ask, ""is everything okay?""
I am buffeted by the winds of my foes' enmity and cast about by the towering waves of cruel fate.
Yet I, a captain, am no longer able to command my vessel, my precinct, from my customary helm, my office.
And you ask, ""is everything okay?""
I've worked the better part of my years on earth overcoming every prejudice and fighting for the position I hold.
And now I feel it being ripped from my grasp.
And with it... The very essence of what defines me as a man.
And you ask, ""is everything okay?""
Yeah, I hear you.
My dog has taken over my favorite chair.
It's like, how did it all slip away?



Gentlemen.
Damn it, Charles. This is a crisis.
Step one: Termination.
You and I will never touch again.
Damn! If I'd known it was our last time, I would've moaned more.
Step two: Containment.
We need to make sure that no one else finds out.
Yeah, Jake won't tell anyone if I ask him not to.
I'll handle him. You take care of Amy.
But how to make it look like an accident?
I'm not saying murder.
Just talk to her like a normal person.
Right, even better, get her to tell me all her little secrets then if she tries anything... Uhh... we can destroy her.
Hello, Peralta.
Oh, my God! Hi.
What's going on here?
Funny story. I took these files home a while ago, even though I shouldn't have.
And now, I'm bringing them back.
Isn't that funny?
Are you laughing behind the mask?
No.
Kev!
Jake, it's after midnight.
This had better be about a murder.
No, I wish.
Look, I'm really sorry, but I have to talk to captain Holt.
Raymond, your work life is here.
Please, come in. Take off your shoes.
Neither of us want that.
What is going on, Peralta?
This has been a long day.
Well, I.A.B. caught me returning some classified files, and I am now the prime suspect in the mole investigation, and Miller said I would be suspended in the morning.
But more importantly, what does the ""J"" stand for?
James? John?
Jo-Jo?
My middle name is more important to you than being suspended?
If it's Jo-Jo? Yes.
Look, I came here because we have to figure this thing out.
Miller is sure there's a mole in the precinct, and the only way to prove it's not me is to figure out who it is.
You said there was no mole.
You said you knew everything about these people.
Well, it turns out I don't.
I've learned some truly horrible things tonight.
You were right, and I was wrong.
Goodness.
Boyle is sleeping with Gina?
What? How could you possibly know that?
""You were right and I was wrong.""
You must have been shaken to your core to say that to me.
Boyle is your most trusted friend, so he has to be involved.
Your use of the word ""horrible"" leads me to believe that the matter was sexual in nature, given your obvious immaturity.
Pfft. I've had s*x.
And, of course, you would be most upset if Boyle were to have slept with someone you knew from your childhood.
Thus, the solve: Gina and Charles.
That was amazing.
Come into my study.
Let's figure out who that mole is.
I took all the giggle I had.
There might be some left in my mouth if you wanna make out.
That sounds amazing.
I'd love to make out with you once I'm super high.
Where can I get some?
That girl over there sold it to me.
Terry: What happened, Ava?
I thought you said you didn't drink or do drugs.
I don't. Do you know how much math is involved in dealing drugs?
You gotta keep a clear head.
Look, this doesn't have to be a big deal.
Just give us the name of your supplier.
How'd you get involved in dealing giggle?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. We gotta back this up.
After pre-school, did you go to private or public elementary?
Private.
When were you potty-trained?
That's so random.
Sarge, the giggle pig.
All right, let's go through the squad one by one.
Rosa's very secretive.
I don't know anything about her personal life.
Charles has expensive tastes.
Gina has said many times that she would sell us all out for five minutes with Blake Griffin.
Let's see, Terry wants to send his twins to private school.
But on his salary, that's difficult.
Mm...
Plus with twins, one of them's always evil, so...
It's Cagney.
Gina, is everything okay?
You never text me.
Look, the last message I got from you was august 3rd, 2009.
You wrote, ""sup, Rosa?""
Followed by, ""never mind.""
It's over between me and Charles.
I'm so upset.
Amy, when will I ever find a relationship as perfect as the one you have with Freddy?
It's Teddy, and it's not perfect.
Believe me.
All his underwear are lined with mesh like a bathing suit. Is it medical?
How do you even ask that?
I don't know, but keep talking.
Jake: What else, what else, what else?
[Snaps] Wait a minute.
One time, I saw Rosa eating watermelon.
But then, when I asked her about it, she said she'd never eaten that or any other kind of melon.
Now that I say it out loud, it doesn't seem like much.
No. Put it on the board!
Oh!
Hey, check it out.
Dog bra.
[Dog growling]
Dog bra.
Oh, I'm so tired. I can't keep my eyes open.
Here... I need you to slap me.
I'm not gonna do that, Peralta.
Oh!
I thought perhaps the element of surprise would help.
It did!
I can't believe we can't figure out who the mole is.
Well, there is someone we haven't talked about yet.
Detective Jake Peralta.
What?
Someone's got a case of the sleepover jokies.
Why would I be the mole?
You were just caught sneaking classified material into the precinct.
You spent six months undercover in the mafia and have many criminal contacts.
You've been known to flaunt departmental rules and regulations, and you are deeply in debt.
Well, if you hadn't tricked me into getting car insurance, I wouldn't be in debt.
You wanna do me? I'll do you right back.
Tit for toot.
I've been on the force for 30 years, and I've never been accused of impropriety.
Oh, is that a fact?
Because I heard you call deputy chief Wuntch by her first name and after that, you told her you hoped she got carried off by crows.
That is gross insubordination.
Madeline is irrelevant.
Our battles extend beyond the confines of NYPD rules.
You're being ridiculous.
Am I? If you're such a great cop, how come you didn't know there was a mole in your precinct?
That's right... Because you did.
Because you are the mole, you mole!
I've heard enough!
Please return your guest pajamas, guest toothbrush, and guest slippers, and get out of here.
It's time for you to be suspended.
Peralta, shouldn't you be suspended by now?
Yes, and I know that you're mad that I'm here, but you're about to get over it, because I know who the mole is.
Lieutenant Miller.
I don't think he's with I.A.B. at all.
I think he's spying for Wuntch.
Wuntch?
You said it yourself.
Your battles extend beyond the confines of NYPD rules.
She wants information about your task force, but she can't get access, so she sent in a spy.
That's why Miller was skulking around the file room when I was supposed to be the only skulker.
That's interesting. I did notice something odd when he and Wuntch first met. She just nodded at him.
She didn't even try to shake his hand.
She already knew he was a germaphobe because they'd met before.
Yes.
Unfortunately, we don't have any hard proof that they're working together.
Well, lucky for you, proof is my middle name.
And yours is Jared.
Juice box.
Jellyfish.
[Gasps] Jamiroquai!
Lieutenant Miller.
What do you want, Peralta?
I wanna play ball.
Clear my name, and I'll give you information about captain Holt.
Well, I'm interested. What kind of information?
It's all on this.
Pretty dope drive, right?
It's a USB shaped like a gun.
Boink!
All right, I'll give it to my superiors and I'll be in contact.
Hey, I know you only wanted to hang out last night so you could find out dirt on me.
What? Uh-uh.
Look, you don't have to be worried.
I'll never tell anyone about you and Charles.
But honestly, it's not as embarrassing as you think.
It was shocking, but then I got over it, and it seemed normal.
Except for seeing how hairless Charles' legs are.
I mean, does he shave them?
No, he wears really cheap pants and as far as I can tell, he's been chafed smooth.
Yikes.
Imagine that wrapped around you.
Okay.
Okay. I could get in a lot of trouble for this.
But the big secret about captain Holt is...
That I have a flair for the dramatic.
Look behind you, Madeline.
[Holt clearing throat]
Jake: We're actually in front of you.
That's my fault... I thought the layout was gonna be different.
I didn't know how you guys were gonna be sitting.
I took a chance.
Miller may be in lnternal Affairs, but he wasn't here on official business.
You sent him to spy on us.
That's a flagrant ethics violation, Madeline.
And it could sink you.
Fine, you're right. But you can't prove that.
It's just your word against mine.
Ooh, actually, it's your word against you.
Pardon me.
I put a recording device in this dope drive, so I got your whole conversation.
Holt: You're going to leave my precinct and my task force alone.
Or else...
You're...
Wuntch meat.
You sure you wanna go with that one?
Absolutely. It's hilarious.
All right.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night.
I let my personal stuff affect the job.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
This morning, I did some real police work.
I called the learning grove.
They never had an ""Ava Watson,"" so I faxed them a picture.
They identified her as Rebecca Lubbock.
I pulled her phone records and...
I think we have some good leads on a possible supplier.
Wow, nice work.
And hey, you should never worry about your kids.
You're the best dad I know.
Cagney and Lacey are gonna grow up great.
You think so?
100%.
You're right.
They're gonna be twin presidents.
They'll either run as one person and trick everyone, or they'll as two and serve for 16 consecutive years.
It's a damned Dynasty.
Excuse me, I have an announcement to make.
Can I have everyone's attention, please.
Charles Boyle and I had s*x.
What the hell?
Gina, what are you doing?
Amy was right.
People will be shocked, and then they'll get over it and we can move on.
At least this way, I get to control how it gets out.
I'm about to Olivia pope this sitch.
First off, I would like to remind you all about several notable men from my past.
The rock-climbing backpacker, the underwear model, the guy who looked like Tywin Lannister.
I bring these men to mind so you can appreciate this dalliance for what it was... An outlier.
I will now take questions.
How was the s*x?
Gross.
The s*x was gross, or I'm gross?
You're gross. The s*x was adequate.
How many times did you do it?
16 and 1/3.
Don't ask, can't explain.
I have a question.
Do you have any regrets?
No. It was pretty fun.
[Mouths word]
Thank you so much for coming out today.
Hey, I should've said this last night, but your first casual relationship... nice work!
I know!
I didn't even propose to her once.
Jake, I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I mean, I wanted to tell you so badly.
But I promised Gina I wouldn't tell anyone.
You kept a promise to a friend.
That sounds like the Charles I know.
Just like I know everyone here.
Yes, you do. Although, there is something you didn't know about me.
My middle name...
Is Jacob.
What?

Wait for it... Wait for it...
9:01!
Amy Santiago is officially late for the first time ever.
All right, let's do this. Who's got theories?
Uh... Alarm didn't go off.
All three alarms? All with battery back-up?
Come on, who wants to take this seriously?
Ooh! She was taken in her sleep!
That's what I'm talking about!
Super dark, Boyle, but way more plausible than the sarge's idiotic alarm clock theory.
I bet she tucked herself into bed too tight and got stuck.
Mm, maybe she Fell into another dimension where she's interesting.
It's 9:00 A.M. why is no one working?
Amy Santiago is a few minutes late, and we're all trying to guess why.
I'd like to play.
I'd say she's in line at the bank.
This is fun.
Jake: It is fun, but you're all wrong.
She clearly slipped through a subway grate and is having terrible s*x with a mole man.
[Elevator dings]
Jake: There she is. Amy.
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick. Do you care to explain yourself?
I'm just 70 seconds late. It's not a big deal.
Don't worry about it.
Santiago, you will tell us, and you will tell us now.
There was a problem at the bank.

So you nervous about the trial tomorrow?
The jewelry store break-in?
Diamond heist.
It's like you're going out of your way to make it sound less cool.
I think the conviction's a slam dunk.
Good. Not to over state it, but I'm definitely gonna die alone, and work is all I have.
I take it dating's not going well.
What?
No! It's awesome.
What happened with Rosa's friend, Katie?
Yeah, she turned out to be even more closed off than Rosa.
So how long have you known Rosa?
None of your business.
All right.
But it's not just her.
All the dates I've been on lately have been lame.
Maybe it's you.
What are your moves?
What do you talk about?
Uh, my moves are fine, mom.
I dazzle them with a bad-ass cop story.
Have you ever thought about going with your non-work interests?
On my first date with my wife, all we did was talk about our mutual love of meat loaf.
The singer not the food.
Oh, so the weirder of the two choices.
All right, fine. I get what you're saying.
Your wife's awesome and I should do everything in my power to be with her physically.
I mean, no, not that.
Don't talk about being a cop.
Just talk about my own interests.
Exactly!
Hey, she's cute.
Jake: And alone.
I'll try and find our meatloaf.
Terry: Go get her, little man.
Hello there.
Hi!
Rosa: Captain...
We need to talk about the union rep elections.
Scully is running again, unopposed.
He is incompetent.
If there's one thing to take away from the new contract, it's that holiday pay is ""now capped.""
Or ""not capped.""
In conclusion, the word ""capped"" was said.
Whoo! Nailed it.
The only reason Scully does the job is because the annual union meeting has a party sub.
He's been a rep for 12 years, and he still pronounces ""union"" as ""onion.""
As management, I'm not allowed to talk about union matters.
Scully doesn't know anything about our pensions and he has no idea about the new disciplinary guidelines.
What do you think, captain?
What I think is, I will continue to not talk about this issue.
Hey, you should run.
Going to meetings, writing stuff down.
You love that nerd stuff.
""Writing things down"" is nerdy?
What do you do?
I just forget stuff like a cool person.
Come on, admit it, you care about this crap.
Maybe.
But I want to be captain one day, and union reps are always fighting with the brass.
It's career suicide, right, sir?
Stop trying to get me involved, Santiago.
No! I'm already fighting with the brass.
Look at what you've done!
Oh man, these look spicy!
We may die tonight.
You know, I actually heard about a guy who died while eating hot wings.
Really?
Yeah, he was terminally ill beforehand though.
Unrelated.
I always thought I'd die at the hands of my own clone.
Well, that's why you have to brand the number two into your clone's cheek.
You shouldn't have a clone if you don't know that.
Yes.
All right, you ready?
I'm ready.
Here we go.
That's nothing.
Amateur night.
I can't believe this had three peppers next to it on the menu...
Oh, my God!
Ah!
Hot!
Oh, so spicy!
Drink the ranch! Drink the ranch!
Ah! Ah!
Here's the stuff you left at my place.
Your sounds of lbiza sleep cd, seven phone chargers, and an empty jar labeled ""fire spirit.""
No, it's not empty.
Well, here's your stuff.
So I guess it's officially over.
It was slightly less gross than I expected.
Mm.
Way to be.
Uh, there is one last thing.
The luxury s*x romp we had planned this weekend.
The hotel says the ""bubbles and bathrobes"" package is non-refundable.
See, that's why I didn't want to pre-pay, Charles.
Yeah, but that's why we got such a good deal.
One hour of free Wi-Fi!
Don't worry, you can have your half of the money back, and I'll take the room.
Pause.
Okay, if one of us is getting pampered all night, it's gonna be me.
I want that room, Gina.
You can't push me around.
We're not poke pals anymore!
Ew!
Amy Santiago, surprised to see you walking around.
Shouldn't you be on your belly, you snake?
Yeah, you snake! [Hisses]
What is happening?
You're running against me.
What? Rosa must've done this.
I'll get her to stop.
You know what really burns my pants?
I considered you my best friend.
What?
What?
Hi.
Hey now.
You are looking very happy.
I am.
Guess what happened last night.
Spoiler alert: Sexy-times.
Okay, now guess.
Sexy-times!
Yes! The whole night was amazing.
We totally hit it off.
I found our meat loaf. Wings.
The band or the show?
The food!
We went back to her place, watched die hards one through with a vengeance, did some adult stuff, and spent the rest of the night debating who's the better ping-pong player.
She was adorably wrong.
How do you know if you didn't play?
Oh, we played, which was difficult since she didn't have a table or paddles.
We had to use an avocado pit as the ball.
It was very messy.
Carl: Hey guys.
Ah, hello, district attorney kurm.
I got lucky last night.
That's great.
Yeah.
So we have a little delay.
Gary, the defense attorney, isn't gonna be here.
Oh, is he sore from high-fiving criminals he's gotten out of jail?
Did he get a murderer off who then murdered him to celebrate?
Yup.
Anyway, Gary broke his leg, so he's being replaced.
Replaced? He should be put down.
Like a horse.
So who's the new sub-human piece of human garbage?
Sophia Perez.
Oh, God.
Jake, this is bad!
You slept with a defense attorney.
You literally slept with the enemy.
I know.
Ah, it's like if John McClane slept with Hans Gruber.
Or even worse, Jeremy irons from the third one.
We didn't talk about our jobs.
How was I supposed to know?
Wait, are you sure you want to do this?
Let's go over the events of tonight.
We got drunk together, I invited you up to my apartment, and I kissed you first.
No further questions.
Okay.
Uh-oh. She's waving at you.
Hey. All right, I'm gonna go talk to her.
Be strong.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, so this is weird, huh?
Yeah. You never told me you were a cop.
Yeah, and you never told me you were a lawyer.
Well, I didn't wanna intimidate you.
Intimidate? Wow.
Okay, well, not to burst your bubble, but I'm only intimidated by professions that have a moral compass, like police officer.
So you're intimidated by your own job?
""Oh, look at me. I'm a lawyer.
I'm so good at word-using-itude.""
And yes, I know that that wasn't a word, right.
Okay, you know what?
I can't even believe I have to deal with you all week.
Not a problem.
This is clearly a conflict of interest.
So I'm just gonna talk to the judge and have you kicked off the case.
Ha ha! No, there's no conflict of interest.
Because I'm not interested in you.
Ah.
God, I can't believe I slept with a cop.
It's like a had s*x with Hans Gruber.
What... I'm not the Gruber!
You're the Gruber!
Die Hard.
Captain, Rosa's trying to make me run for union rep.
You have to stop her.
I cannot do that.
As I told you, I'm not allowed to get involved.
It's too late anyway.
You already have a campaign slogan.
""Pick Amy, dummies."" I wrote that.
Tell her how good it is, captain.
Again, I cannot.
Look, I love campaigning and making signs.
Lord knows I have enough poster board at home.
But captain, please tell her I shouldn't run for union rep.
I'm just gonna turn around in my chair.
So, Amy, you're saying I should just return this...
Button maker?
You think you can tempt me with a t150 button maker?
Sir, you've gotta see this.
It doesn't even make mirror-backs.
This is a joke.
Still not participating.
I'm enjoying a magazine.
Joke's on you, Amy. You and Scully are giving campaign speeches in the briefing room tomorrow.
What?
Sir, permission to arrest Diaz for being a jerk.
Permission to shoot Santiago for being a coward.
Stop it, both of you.
Now you've done it.
You've made me turn my chair.
I will not get involved, and I will not have this office transformed into a house of snipes and jabs.
Dismissed.
Full disclosure, your honor.
Last night, miss Perez and I got inebriated, and we had colitis.
Colitis?
Coitus.
Yeah, that.
A cop and a defense attorney sleeping together.
That's highly unusual.
At the time, I did not know she was a defense attorney.
I should have been able to guess, however, based on her ability to lie all over me.
Ha ha... a cop's attempt to be clever.
It's like watching a horse try to eat with a fork.
Majestic and hilarious?
Take a cold shower, horn-dog, we're at work.
But in all seriousness, your honor, I do think she should recuse herself from the trial.
Why? You think I might tell everybody in the courtroom that you like to be the little spoon?
Everyone likes to be the little spoon.
It makes you feel safe!
Carl, back me up on this.
Yes, little spoon all the way.
See?
Look, I'm not recusing myself.
I talked to my client, and he is fine with me staying on.
If the defendant is okay with it, and you two can be mature in the courtroom, then I see no reason why we can't proceed.
Great. I can be mature.
Says the guy who uses a sunglasses case as a wallet.
Stuff can be two things.
Open up your refrigerator, boom!
Air conditioner. Life hacked.
Carl, back me up.
I mean, it's not very green.



Oh, Carl.
Guys!
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
My pizza reviews caught the eye of a Mr. Matt Pittle of Pittle's vittles, my favorite food blog!
Wow, a local food blog.
It's all happening.
Pittle wants to have a five- hour dinner with me tonight.
Attention, skeezy nobodies!
Tina Knowles, Beyonce's mom-ager, has contacted me and wants to audition me tonight.
I've transcended you now.
Sounds like both of you have pretty great plans tonight.
No! You wrote the email from Pittle so I'd drop my claim to the room.
That blog is sacred.
You defiled the most sacred and most high miss... Tina kno-w-les!
How dare you, Charles?
How'd you get your voice so high?
[Shrilly] I can take it higher.
I wish you wouldn't.
The room is mine, you scab.
No, it's mine, Gina.
I'm not backing down this time.
I'm backing up.
Beep, beep, beep.
[Coughs]
You nervous?
Nope.
I have an unimpeachable eyewitness who saw everything.
Plus, I've got a little something planned for our lawyer friend.
Every time she looks over, I'm gonna hit her with one of these.
It'll remind her that we kissed, and that's how I get in her head.
I like it.
You want me to flex and make all the buttons pop off of my shirt?
Yes! You can do that?
The challenge is keeping the buttons on.
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
And you're sure this is the man you saw leaving the store at the time of the diamond heist?
Nice. ""Diamond heist,"" catching on.
Uh, yeah. That's the guy.
Now, Mr. Wells, it says here you have a 2006 conviction for perjury, is that correct?
Uh... yeah.
It's okay. I knew about that.
And is Sidney Wells actually your name, or is it Brian Davidson?
Uh-oh. Did not know about that one.
As in the Brian Davidson who is facing fraud charges in New Jersey?
Yeah.
Or that. Oh, God... okay, time to bust out the big guns.
Jake: This is bad.
Only the judge saw me.
Sophia: No further questions, your honor.
Ugh, winking? Real mature.
Carl: Judge gave us a recess, but if we don't get new evidence by tomorrow, we have no chance.
Great pep talk, Carl.
Don't worry, we'll get some evidence.
Excuse me one second.
Hey, that wasn't cool.
No. What wasn't cool was you trying to air make-out with the judge.
Those kisses were meant for you!
Not in a romantic way, they were psych-out kisses.
Look, you know your client did it.
It doesn't matter if my client did it or not.
That's what I've been saying. [Whispers] It doesn't matter.
All right, Scott, beat it.
Scott.
Look, my job is to make you prove he did it.
It's the basis of our entire justice system.
What, you think John Adams was just some idiot?
No, I think John Adams was a mini-series I didn't watch because it looked like a book.
Look, without a credible witness, your case is a mess.
Kinda like your ping-pong serve.
Oh, my God. She smells so good.
That avocado pit was not regulation.
Wish that had sounded cooler.
Come on, Terry, let's go save the day.
Carl, you wanna come?
No, thank you.
All right.
All right, listen up.
We need more evidences on this guy and we need it quick, so no time for chit-chat.
What's going on? You love chit-chat.
Yeah, also, your posture seems off, like, it's good.
Because I'm being serious because I don't want this perp to walk.
This isn't about the perp.
It's about this woman.
Jake slept with her.
Oh, she's so pretty.
She looks like the woman on an olive oil bottle.
Way to go, Jake.
She's a defense attorney.
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Boo!
Hey, guys, let's take it easy on him.
Thank you, Terry.
But seriously, I think you need to get checked for rabies.
Hey, I have a good rabies guy, if you need one.
Uh-huh. All right, listen.
Can we focus up?
Our witness is useless, so we either need to recover the stolen gems or find the break-in tool.
What year was the perp's house built in?
Some of those old brownstones had dumbwaiters.
A perfect hiding spot.
Good thinking, Amy.
All right, I'm gonna win this case and then we can put my horrible sexual experience behind us forever.
Charles: I don't know Jake.
I'm afraid I'm gonna think about it every time I look at your crotch.
Then stop looking at my crotch!
What are you doing?
Just pointing people to the one Detective who actually wants to run for union rep.
Welcome to my nightmares, Amy-Scully minotaur.
Pretty clever signing me up for the speech this afternoon.
But guess what?
Mine is epically bad and way too long.
There's a section where I just pick people out of the crowd and insult them.
It gets really personal.
Did you know that Hitchcock is technically ""a b*st*rd""?
Santiago, can I talk to you in my office?
Mm-hmm.
Blinds closed?
Are we having a pow-wow?
As you know, I shouldn't be talking about this election with any of my detectives, but I will with you.
Of course.
Because you trust me.
Because you're royally screwing up.
Oh, no, this isn't a pow-wow.
It's a haranguing.
You bet it is.
Stop trying to tank this election.
You know damned well you'd make a great union rep.
But, sir, I want to be captain one day, and clashing with the brass is career suicide.
Not for me.
By my very nature, I was constantly in conflict with my superiors.
Listen, you're black and gay, so I think you should just take all the black, gay cases.
You know, the weird stuff.
I strongly disagree.
But I still managed to rise through the ranks.
Run for union rep, Amy.
Okay. I'll do it.
But never tell anyone about this...
Pow-wow.
You called it a pow-wow!
So, Detective Peralta, you found some ""new"" evidence last night.
Correction: I found some damning new evidence last night.
It was hidden in an old dumbwaiter in the defendant's house.
All his burglary tools, including a glass cutter he used to break into the store.
Sophia: Yes, but isn't it possible my client could've used the glass cutter for something other than a robbery?
I mean, after all, stuff can do two things, right?
Hey! I say that!
That's my saying!
Your honor, she stole my saying.
People don't own sayings.
Please answer the question, Detective.
Fine. In the same bag as the burglary tools, we also found shards of glass.
And you expect us to believe that you found this new evidence yesterday just as your case was collapsing around you?
Jake: I certainly hope so, because it's the truth.
In fact, I believe it was the great John Adams who once said, ""to believe all men honest is folly.
To believe none... Is something worse.""
Let the record show miss Perez looks stunned and defeated. No further questions.
You're not allowed to say that.
Yup.
Hey, captain, I have a juicy little Boyle nugget I'd like to drop on you.
Okay, please drop a nugget.
I think that the squad could really increase its efficiency if Gina spent the night re-logging all our files with keywords.
The lady doth have the skills.
Funny, she was just telling me how you should work all night.
Say what?
Gina.
Yes?
You've both made compelling points about the amount of work that needs to be done around here, so you'll both be pulling overnight shifts.
Before you complain, I am once again turning in my chair.
Oh, sweet chair turn. That's a real power move.
So good.
We, the jury, find the defendant...
Not guilty.
Oh, come on!
Ow!
Oh, I'm in too much pain to care how cool and strong that made me look.
It was already splintering.
Don't take this away from me.
Wow, well done. Another criminal walks free.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Maybe stop calling my client a criminal, since he was found not guilty.
Well, I find myself not guilty of never seeing you again.
So you will see me again?
No!
Why, what did I say? You know what?
You're the worst!
Terry: Jake, what are you doing, man?
Walking angrily away towards a door that I now see says ""emergency exit only"" on it, so I'm turning around, but I'm still ticked!
Look, man. Don't screw this up.
I hate defense attorneys as much as any rational adult, but you obviously have feelings for Sophia.
Yeah, anger.
I don't know.
It just seems to me like you met your match.
You said yourself how boring your dates have been.
But you have to admit, Sophia wouldn't be boring.
I will admit she's not boring.
And we do have fun together.
I guess you could say she's passably attractive.
All right, fine. She's super hot.
God, I can't believe I'm about to ask out a defense attorney.
And we all know that Amy Santiago wants to be captain one day, which means she will never stand up to management.
I don't want to be captain. I just want my sub.
Please just give me back my sub.
Vote Scully.
[Applause]
Amy: I'm gonna make this quick.
Scully said that I want to be captain, and I do.
But that won't stop me from standing up for you.
He also said if you voted for him, you'd get a golden boat.
That's not real.
If I get elected, I'll go to all the union meetings, actually pay attention, and most importantly, I'll bring back party sub leftovers.
Thank you, Scully.
""Pick Amy, dummies.""
[Applause]
Hello.
Hey. How'd you find me?
I'm a Detective, remember?
I also went into a bunch of wrong offices first.
Stole hella peppermints.
So what's up? You here to yell at me again for doing my job?
No, I'm here to ask you out.
Oh.
Yeah.
There's a bar in the west village that has a bunch of ping-pong tables, so I thought we could head over there and have a drink, talk, and then, with any luck, things will get uncomfortably competitive.
That sounds fun.
Look, if we're going to do this, we're gonna have to have a couple of rules.
Rule number one, starting right now: No work talk.
Perfect, we can just skip straight to making out on your desk.
Yeah, that's not my desk. This is.
Copy that.
Blame it on the janitor and make a break for it?
Absolutely.
After you.
Charles, I'm sorry that neither of us have the room.
Yes. I, too, am disappointed by this unfortunate stalemate.
Why are you talking all victorian?
You're lying about something. That's what that means.
Nonsense, m'lady.
Okay, fine... I might not be in that hotel room right now, but my Gene pool is.
Ew.
What'd you do in there?
I gave the hotel room to my father and told him to check in under my name.
What? No! I gave my key to my mom!
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong room.
That's okay.
Hey, wait a second, do we know each other?
Is your daughter Gina?
Yes! And you're that little man's father, Boyle.
Yeah.
We met at the family food drive.
I'm Darlene Linetti.
Lynn Boyle, pleased to re-meet you.
So what do you think's going on here?
Mix up or something?
I don't know.
Regina's been encouraging me to have some... Romantic adventures.
Holy cow.

Morning.
Who are those for?
Captain Holt's uncle passed away.
They weren't close, but I wanted to do something.
Interesting.
Flowers are a bold choice, Santiago, but I can still beat you.
Beat me at expressing condolences?
Yup, it's on.
Flowers are a gift, and Captain Holt hates gifts.
I think a thoughtful email is the way to go here.
""Dear Captain, we were all so sorry for your loss.""
Group sentiment, very meaningful.
""Please let us know if there's anything we can do.""
Selfless act.
Very respectful.
Correct, I am the King of respectfulness, bitches!
Hey, did you send that from your personal or work account?
Personal... It's a personal matter involving a personal friend and his personal uncle.
So you remembered to turn off your signature, right?
Oh, no.
[Knocking]
Hey, Captain, I just sent you an email, uh...
""Dear Captain, we were all so sorry for your loss.
""Please let us know if there's anything we can do.
Sent from my stinky butt.""
I was hacked?
Thank you for the email. It means a lot to me.
[Sighs] You're very welcome.
I was addressing your stinky butt.
♪ ♪
Okay, guys, Captain and I are going to a charity event in Brighton beach.
Have a great Thanksgiving.
Ahem.
Sorry, Boyle. Turkey day.
Once sergeant Jeffords and I are gone, Peralta will be the officer in command.
Jake in charge. No-look five.
Whoo!
That's not your hand.
[Gasps] Wait.
Is that a healed-over earring hole?
Do you have a scandalous past?
I was stabbed in the line of duty.
The scar extends through the lobe into the neck.
No one likes it when you do that.
Anyway, thank you for taking command of the precinct over the holiday.
Not a problem.
As you all know, I hate Thanksgiving.
The pilgrims were murderers, and turkey tastes like napkins.
I just hope that no Amys feel bad that I was chosen over Amy.
Actually, Captain asked me first, but I had plans.
Teddy brewed a Thanksgiving pilsner, and it's bottling day.
Bottling day?
Why'd you come in at all?
And frankly, sir, I'm a little hurt that I wasn't your top choice to be in charge.
I'd like to remind you of what happened when I asked you to run the blood drive.
So I forgot to put up the posters, and no one came, but don't worry, because I donated 5 pints all by me-self.
It's one 12-hour shift.
What are you afraid is gonna happen?
Injury, death, general calamity.
Just don't burn the place down.
You can count on me, sir. Happy Thanksgiving.
Turkey day. Sorry, Boyle.
I know you're all leaving in an hour, but until that time, you're under my command.
And as leader, it is my job to make my employees' lives better, so what can I do for you? Gina?
I would like to answer the phone always just like, ""eh-heh?""
Done. Charles?
Lift the precinct-wide ban on me saying the word ""succulent.""
Done.
I want to work in the break room, so I don't have to hear Charles say ""succulent.""
Done, done, Done-zel Washington.
Hitchcock: If she's working in the break room, can I move my nap couch out into the bullpen?
Brooks and done.
Oh, so your plan is to not take this seriously at all?
Oh, I am as serious as a heart attack.
No offense, Scully.
Eh, mine are never that serious.
I call 'em ""oopsies.""
You can't just grant wishes, Jake.
You're a boss, not a genie.
I am both. I am a boss-genie.
And this office is my lamp. Who likes me being in charge?
Succulent.
Thanks for coming to this event, sergeant.
Always happy to spend time with you, sir.
Thank you.
Plus, the longer I stay out of my house today, the better.
My brother-in-law Zeke is in town.
Oh, I remember Zeke. Large gentleman.
Calls you tiny Terry.
Also teensy Terry, teeny-weeny Terry-Berry, and Li'l Dum-Dum.
You know, it's the lack of effort on that last one that really gets me.
You're a grown man, sergeant, strong like an oak.
That's a pretty good tree.
It's a mighty tree.
So why not stand up to this Zeke?
I get so intimidated around him.
Thanks for the sandwich, Li'l Dum-Dum.
If you wanted to get out of the house, why didn't you just volunteer to run the precinct instead of Peralta?
I'd much rather have you in charge.
Don't worry about Jake. He's gonna do great.
He can be very responsible.
Okay, the elevator door is the goal.
Try and score on me.
Ah!
Yes!
All right, it's noon. We're going home.
See you later, boss-genie.
Succulent bossing, Jakey.
I'm gonna go home and stuff my goose.
Wait, Boyle, powder. What is that powder?
I don't know. I don't know, what do we do?
Jake: Okay, everyone, we are in lockdown, which means no one can come in or out of the precinct.
Now, apparently, three other precincts received similar packages this month, and they were all baking powder.
Nevertheless, Hazmat has to run a quick test, but I anticipate we'll all be out of here momentarily.
In the meantime, I suggest we turn this lockdown into a pop-and-lockdown.
Right? Am I right?
Huh?
Okay, so I'll keep everyone updated, and keep working on your dance moves.
Jake, what are you doing? This is a crisis.
I'm trying to keep morale up, because Hazmat said it's almost definitely a hoax.
Almost? What if it's Anthrax?
We are all 100% gonna die!
Guys! You're freaking people out.
Can you please calm it down? We're doing fine here.
Not Hitchcock.
He got trapped out on the balcony.
I don't like him alone out there, not with his history.
I mean, what if he gets up on a ledge?
What, you think he's gonna jump?
No, he's just always falling off things.
He's got a worm living in his ear that affects his balance.
Oh, well, then he's not truly alone out there, right?
Okay, I'm gonna call Holt. You want to come?
Yeah. Too bad, you're not invited.
I'm in charge. Bye!
Holt: Okay, keep me posted.
Peralta seems to have it under control.
He said things were ""dope.""
I want to monitor the situation.
I need to get somewhere with an lnternet connection and a landline.
You live out here. Do you have a home office?
Well, yeah, but Zeke is in that room, and...
Perfect. Let's go there.
Or my neighbors are out of town.
We could break into their place.
Fine, we'll go to my house.
Or as Zeke calls it, tiny Terry's hobbit hole.
All right, sorry for the delay, but I have some news.
I gotta say, your Hazmat suit is super scary.
You should talk in a silly voice, so you seem less terrifying.
Well, we ran our test.
See, even that would be much less ominous if you just did a grover voice.
[Imitating grover] Well, we ran our tests.
And it's not baking powder.
There's a chance it's toxic.
[Grover voice] What?
We know it's not baking powder. What is it?
We don't know yet, sir, but we are...
Sir, you shouldn't have to be below eye level, so I'm gonna hold you up.
Okay, you do look good in Amy's purple shirt.
Anyways, it's Thanksgiving, so the emergency services lab is closed.
They're gonna reopen them, but it'll be at least five hours till they can run detailed tests.
Boyle, status report?
We're locked down with 42 civilians, divided into four factions.
First, we have 12 perps locked up in holding.
Okay, we will call them the dirty dozen.
Oh, I love it.
Second faction is the innocent people who just had the bad luck of being here, some witnesses, some mugging victims, couple food delivery guys.
Great, we'll refer to them as the normies.
Charles: Third faction is trouble: Your snitches, your suspects, couple of gang members here to pick up their friends.
Permission to give them a nickname, sir?
Permission granted.
The naughty boys.
Permission denied.
We will refer to them exclusively as the doinkmeisters.
Way better.
The last faction is the worst, six lawyers.
Ugh, you know what, I'm just gonna call them the vegetable medley, because that's the grossest thing I can think of.
So what's the plan?
Sir, I think we should separate the factions, so we don't become outnumbered.
We should start rationing the food now, and we should tell people that we're in for a long night, because the substance is not baking powder.
Whoa, whoa, that's just gonna freak everyone out.
We want people to be happy and calm.
[Gasps] We should play them sade.
Holt: Keeping the peace is important.
I'm not there to read the situation, but... and I can't believe I'm actually saying this...
I did leave Peralta in charge, so call me if you need anything.
Oh, sir, one other thing, Hitchcock got trapped out on the balcony.
Good, sounds like we dodged a bullet there.
Yeah.
Well, that's settled.
Diaz, Santiago, I want you out there with me, keeping people's morale up.
Boyle, you go through security footage and see if you can see who brought in that box.
Okay, but, I mean, I thought since you were in charge, maybe I could be your right-hand man, your tinker bell.
Tinker bell?
Let me tell you something about tinker bell.
Tinker bell is a loyal lieutenant and a real Thorn in the side of Captain Hook.
Fine, done, you're my number two.
Yes! I made number two.
I hear it. Why would I ever say that?
Thank you.
I got ahold of E.S.U.
The lab tech is en route from his home in New Jersey.
Sergeant, is there any way you can replace this large ball with a chair that is actually a chair?
I'm sorry, sir, that's all I've got.
But it's good for your core.
Yes. My core, it's engaged.
[Chuckles] I wouldn't take fitness tips from this shrimp.
Sir, you remember my brother-in-law, Zeke?
Yes, hello.
Zeke: Hey.
What happened to the game I was dvr-ing?
I was recording it for later.
Well, the Captain wanted to have the news on, so I stopped the recording.
Well, the game was a blowout anyway.
I mean everyone died. Sports are canceled.
You better hope that's true.
[Door closes]
Good, he's gone.
Now, let's get serious and focus up.
Just trying to get to the printer.
Hey, hey, hey, people.
How about everyone come on, bring it in here, gather around?
So how we all holding up?
Not good. We're trapped on Thanksgiving.
What's going on, man?
Okay, great, first off, happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Shout-out to turkey.
Whoo-whoo!
Thank you. All right, so here's the deal.
We are still awaiting the initial test results, but hopefully, we'll hear soon that it's all harmless and we can all go home soon.
[Whispering] You're doing a great...
What are you doing?
I'm whispering in your ear. It's what a number two does.
It was way too close.
Can you say it quietly to me, please?
[Whispering] This is going really well.
Okay.
At any rate, I figured we could pass the time and do something fun, maybe a movie night.
Our options are a bootleg copy of the Diane Keaton classic, something's gotta give.
Movie's hilarious.
Okay, surprising opinion.
We'll talk about that later.
And our second option is surveillance footage of Detective Amy Santiago soliciting drugs using perfect grammar.
It's not that weird to say, ""may I have some cocaine?""
It is. Those options suck.
Fair enough, why don't we have a talent show then?
Who has a special talent?
Oh, I just learned the single ladies dance.



Hey! Yes!
[People cheering]
Jake: People love it.
Look at that, two painted ladies just joined in.
You got to admit, Boyle really knows how to move his pelvis.
I can't believe this is one of the last things I'm ever gonna see.
Actually, with Anthrax, the last things you'll see will be doctor, blood, doctor, pus, scab, nothing.
Why are you saying that?
'Cause you're being melodramatic, so I'm making fun of you. Fine.
I'm writing you out of my will.
Say good-bye to my sculpture of two ""jag-u-ars"" making love.
Whoo! This is why I became a cop.
Really? People love the talent show.
Lawyer guy's doing stand-up.
He's got really good material. Oh.
There are two jobs where you have total control over the people that pay you: President of a country and cleaning lady.
[Laughter]
I can't believe you gave the mob a megaphone.
Okay, first of all, we didn't have a mic, and second, it's not a mob.
It's a happy group of unlikely friends.
Charles: Maybe not so happy.
People are starting to get hungry.
Oh. Okay, not a problem.
Let's get them some food.
Voila, a Thanksgiving feast from the two delivery guys who are trapped in here with us, and paid for by me with Boyle's money.
Put it on the tab.
What about me?
Uh, I guess I could have a friend throw some pretzels up to you from the street?
And soda too?
Fine, I'll have someone blindly throw ice-cold metal cans of soda at you.
Jake, I know you think this is going well, but you can't keep putting out fires as they come up.
You need to set down some rules.
It's fine. Everyone is happy.
Now we just coast to the all-clear.
We're freezing in here! We want heat!
We want heat!
Both: We want heat!
All: We want heat! We want heat!
What?
I'm glad I gave them the megaphone.
It helps me hear their concerns.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a couple bags... of heat.
Charles and I arrest the guy a couple of years ago that was selling knock-off designer coats.
We just gotta find the box they're in, and everyone will be warm and happy.
You can't let them gang up on you.
You need to man up.
Man up? Sexist.
I'm sorry, but I don't see gender, sir.
Tell them the truth about the powder, tell them that they're gonna be here awhile, and tell them that they might have to be a little uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable because of how amazing I look in this?
Zeke, I'm sorry, but Captain thinks we're gonna have to use your room for a little longer.
No problem.
Really? Yeah, I feel you.
I got a boss that's a jerk like that too.
Right.
The Captain's the worst.
Sometimes, I call him Holt the dolt.
[Laughs] That's cold.
Stay tough, brother.
Brother?
Brother. I will, brother.
All right.
Talk to you later, brother.
See you, brother.
Bye, brother.
Okay, I have finished my last will and testament.
To Rosa, I leave you nothing.
Pass.
You can't pass on me leaving you nothing.
Just did.
Not today, Rosa.
To Charles, I leave you the memories of my supple form.
I'm reminding everyone of my embarrassing sexual past 'cause I'm hoping it's the act of charity that gets me into heaven.
Why is she talking about heaven?
Is there something wrong here we don't know about?
No, no, no! She's just being a funny weirdo.
Everything's fine.
More importantly, I was not able to find any ""heat"" because it's more of a concept, but we did find these beauties.
They're all faux fur and all the best brands.
We've got ChanelB, Grucci, Stella McCarKeys.
I want the one with the muff.
Great choice, sir, but there's actually only five coats, so we're gonna have to figure out a way to share them.
I was thinking maybe a trivia contest.
Screw the coats. I want more food.
Interesting fact there... It turns out the one-time-only feast was all the food that we had.
What? You didn't ration the food?
I'm not gonna sit here and starve.
It's Thanksgiving. You said it was a hoax.
We're only here because of some dumb protocol.
I'm leaving. I'm walking out that door.
Jake, you have to arrest him.
No, it'll only make things worse.
Look, we're doing this my way. I'm the Captain now!
That totally sounded like a movie ref, but I was actually being serious.
Excuse me, sir? Hi.
Can I talk to you in my office for a sec?
It's nothing serious, just a fun chat.
[Whispering] Look, if you don't come with me, she's going to arrest you.
[Whispering] Hey, are you guys whispering?
I'm Charles Boyle.
I'm sort of the number two guy around here.
Okay, so first of all, I'm just gonna set the mood for this meeting, perhaps a smooth jam.
[R&b music playing] Ahh.
Yeah, it's good.
♪ ♪
All right, here's the deal.
The Hazmat guys did run some preliminary tests, and the substance is not baking powder.
Oh. Was it Anthrax?
They don't know yet, but I promise you, as soon they tell me, you'll be the first to know.
Well, second after me, so third overall.
Still pretty good.
I just don't want people to panic, so I'm asking for your help to keep this thing quiet, so we can have the chillest biohazard lockdown in Brooklyn, yeah?
Of course, I understand.
Great, thank you.
See, if you talk to people like humans, they'll be reasonable. I mean, it's just good...
Oh, why is he standing on that chair?
Hey, everyone! They lied to us!
It's friggin' Anthrax!
[Overlapping shouting]
Oh, what you making, a snack?
Oh, the Captain wants four sandwiches.
A spoonful of Mayo, spread evenly, middle-loaf pieces of bread only.
What an ass.
[Scoffs] Tell me about it...
Brother.
Uh, I almost forgot. He wants a whole pie too.
[Scoffs] This dude is the worst.
I don't always understand Peralta's texts.
He says they're still waiting on the lab, and ""it's allz good."" ""Alls"" with a ""z.""
Then a box with a question mark inside, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, and yet another box with a question mark.
Then a box with a question mark.
What does that mean?
It means you don't have emojis on your phone.
[Overlapping shouting]
All right, everyone calm down! Just calm down!
Let us out, or I'm gonna start breaking things!
This is a human rights violation!
You can't keep us here!
I'm 23, I'm a celebrity, and today, I'm gonna die!
Not one word of that is true.
Ow!
Ooh, Hitchcock's bleeding!
He got hit in the head with a soda can!
He never saw it coming!
Jake, we have to start putting people in detention.
We have to quash this.
No, we need them to calm down.
We need to put on something's gotta give.
Great idea. Great movie.
Also, we should probably put out that fire.
[Alarm beeping]
So, Captain, I have some news.
What happened?
Well, remember when you told me not to burn down the precinct?
You burned down the precinct?
No, I had the fire put out almost immediately.
This is a success story.
Tell me exactly what happened.
[Sighs] Well, it started with Boyle wanting to say the word ""succulent.""
Oh, no. And it ended with a small riot, in which a dirtbag set Hitchcock's nap couch on fire.
Enough!
Jeffords and I will come right away.
I'm very disappointed in you.
[Whispering] What's he saying?
He said he's very disappointed in you.
Oh, man!
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
I know you're too proud to say ""I told you so,"" so I'm just gonna...
Told you so. Not too proud.
That seems right.
Look, I screwed up, and I think you should take over command of the precinct.
Been waiting to hear you say that all day.
I know.
Which is why you shouldn't say it. What?
You're still trying to make people happy.
Don't apologize to me.
Be a leader and tell me what you need me to do.
Tell everyone what you need them to do.
You're the Captain, Jake.
I'm the Captain now.
Captain Phillips. Captain Phillips!
That's what it was.
""Look at me, look at me.""
Right? Yeah.
All right, guys, listen up. All right, listen up, people.
Boyle, you're no longer my number two.
[Sighs] What did you say to him, Amy?
You've been after my job this whole time.
It's not Amy. I don't need a tinker bell.
I need you to find out where that powder came from.
Scully, I need you to help Boyle.
Don't worry about Hitchcock. He'll be fine.
I once saw him fall down three flights of stairs, get up, and keep eating his hot dog, like nothing happened.
You're right. He's the strongest man we know.
No. Gina, I know you're scared, but you got to stop freaking out the civilians.
Yes, I am very influential.
And, Diaz, you need to stop making fun of Gina and help her.
Fine. All right, everyone, listen up!
I know this is tough to hear, but we still don't know what the powder is, and we may be here for a while yet.
Also, the copy room is now a detention center for anyone who gets out of line.
This is a police station in a lockdown, not a summer camp.
[Whispering] Ooh, should we play capture the flag?
Jake! Right.
Stay tuned for more details. That'll be all for now.
I'm just gonna go downstairs and thank your family for accommodating us.
You will do nothing of the sort.
Zeke is being nice to me for the first time ever because he thinks you're a jerk just like his boss.
When we go downstairs, I want you to scream at me.
I want you to really degrade me in front of my family.
And this will make you happy?
It's the best Thanksgiving gift you could give me.
What an idiotic thing to say. What's a Thanksgiving gift?
I'm just getting in the zone.
I love it!
Also, I said you ate all that pie.
Can you put some around your mouth?
Fine. Crumb me up.
I have news, everyone.
The powder was not harmful.
[Cheers and applause]
Scully! [Laughs]
Aw, I gotta say, that's pretty sweet.
Oh, the door closed behind him. Now they're both locked outside.
What happened? What's going on?
Jake: Lockdown's officially over.
Squad's heading home for Thanksgiving.
I don't understand.
Last I heard, the precinct was on fire, and we wouldn't get lab results for another three hours.
Boyle sped things up.
I noticed an I.T. guy we fired two years ago in surveillance footage.
Turns out he was also fired from the other precincts.
E.S.U. raided his home and found bacillus streptomoo-cocomo... I can't pronounce it.
Regardless, he confessed, and it wasn't poisonous.
All right, it seems like you turned it around.
Yeah, actually, we're trying to clean up here, Captain, so unless you have something meaningful to contribute, you can get the hell out.
Oh, right, sorry, you weren't here when I switched up my management style.
That must be so confusing for you.
Anyways, everyone head on home! Happy Thanksgiving, guys!
Jake. Happy turkey day, guys.
I'll be in my office.

Have a nice weekend, Peralta?
Yeah, nothing special. You know, I got a couple...
You missed Scully's birthday.
It was kind of a big one.
Nobody showed at the party.
Guys, guys, guys, we missed Scully's birthday, and it was a big one.
Amy: I know.
I panicked and said I had to go to the vet because my puppy-cat got sick.
I said I had to take my mom to get birth control pills.
Terry: That's better than my excuse.
I said I had to go to my girls' bat mitzvahs.
Squad, we missed Scully's birthday, and it was a big one.
I told them I was in Ecuador. I think they bought it.
We gotta make it up to him.
Let's give him cash.
Everyone, put in $20 each.
Uh...
Yes, I'll cover you.
Hey, Scully...
Huh?
We're sorry that we missed your party.
Oh, don't worry about it. You all had stuff to do.
Yes, the capital of Ecuador is Quito.
Oh.
Anyway, Happy Birthday from all of us.
Thanks, guys. You're the best.
All: Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday, Scully.
Thanks.
I can't believe it. The fake birthday worked!
You're a genius!
We're both geniuses!

I'm running this task force, so everything goes through me.
Got it? Good.
Jackson, some ecstasy was found on the F train.
Take it to the lab. Find out if it's giggle pig.
Scully, Hitchcock, work your C.I.S.
Miller, get a new k-9. That dog is an idiot.
[Dog whimpers] All right, move out.
Hey. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late.
I had to go back to the deli and return my everything bagel.
In what world does ""everything"" not include beef jerky?
All of them. Okay.
Here's what's up. Yeah.
Task force brought in a giggle pig dealer this morning.
Nice.
Second guy we've brought in that's had one of these keys.
Huh.
My best guess, this opens a creepy, old wardrobe/portal to an enchanted land full of talking toads and fairy folk.
Interesting.
It has something to do with the post office.
It's got ""USPS"" engraved on it.
Take it to the postal inspection service.
See what you can find out.
Copy that.
Hey, work this thing hard.
We're under a lot of pressure with the task force, so we could really use a win.
You got it.
You're my friend, and I won't let you down.
I'm gonna push you up, just like a bra.
What?
I meant like a brassiere, which is totally different.
Come on, man.
Not better. Here we go. Here we go!
Santiago, I may need you to come in for a bit on saturday.
Again? Are you kidding me, man?
[Gasps]
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.
Hi!
Oh, my God.
What just happened?
Her mind finally snapped, like a stale breadstick.
Captain, please forgive me.
I'm just a little on edge because I'm trying to quit smoking.
I can't take the stress of hiding it from Teddy anymore.
[Knocking on door]
Be right out, Teddy!
[Gags]
I'm going cold turkey, and it makes me irritable.
Terrifying.
I know I should be able to do this by myself, but it would be great if you guys could maybe keep an eye on me.
Of course, we'll do everything we can to help.
Or, plan B, I could arrange for you to go to a safe place where you can just relax and watch pretty boats go by.
Look, this one's on an island.
Okay, we're looking for room 247, agent Jack danger.
Agent Jack danger?
Wow, that name is buh-dass.
Code for ""badass."" Yeah.
So buh-dass.
Ah, here we are.
Wait.
Cool guy, probably expecting a cool knock.
That was incredible.
Danger: Enter.
Are you danger?
Jack danger?
It's actually pronounced ""dong-er.""
It's derived from a Dutch word meaning ""prudence in financial matters.""
Oh, Jack donger.
Also cool.
Have a seat.
I understand you need a little help from the big boys here at USPIS.
USPIS?
Yeah, U.S. postal inspection service, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1772, undoubtedly the great man's greatest accomplishment.
Are you aware that he helped popularize parmesan cheese in America?
I am.
USPIS is the crown jewel of the law enforcement system.
1,200 inspectors tackling everything from mail fraud to the shipment of contraband fruit.
And, of course, occasionally assisting our little brothers in the police department.
Little brothers?
Well, I am a federal agent. You're just a local cop.
Nothing wrong with that.
Charles: Uh, we're here because we found this key.
Whoa. Yes.
This sexy beast was used to open a type of mailbox we actually haven't used in years.
However, there are a few around town that were never removed.
Real beauts.
I can find out where they are and send you the locations.
That would be great. Here, my email is...
Uh, no email. [Chuckles]
I'll send it to you with r-mail, which is to say, real mail, because email has put hundreds of my coworkers out of work.
How would you like it if they laid off all of your fellow detectives and partnered you with a robocop?
I've literally drawn sketches of that.
The robot has a backpack that can carry me.
Hey, how's cold turkey going?
[Talking with mouth full]
I heard chewing gum helps.
You know, I never smoked, but I did once have an addiction.
Food... it got bad.
You're not closed!
It's 6:00!
I need my mushu pork!
I need my mushu!
You know how I finally stopped eating?
You got too big to fit through the kitchen door?
I learned how to beat my cravings.
Every time I wanted food, I rebooted my system.
Are you ready to reboot?
When I'd feel a food craving, I would dunk my head into ice water and reset my brain.
Watch me. Aah!
[Muffled scream]
Whoo!
I'm all good!
[Laughs] Yeah, you try!
Okay. Now!
[Muffled scream]
[Gasps]
Do it again!
[Muffled scream]
It's so cold! It's really cold!
Last time.
[Muffled screams]
We think the drug dealers have been using these out-of-service mailboxes as drops for giggle pig and money.
Good job. I'm glad danger was useful.
Actually, it's ""dong-er.""
Although it should be ""dong-est.""
Can't imagine anyone being more dong than this guy.
Sounds like he was a good resource.
He showed you where the mailboxes were, right?
Yeah, but he also told us how he brought down a snail-smuggling ring.
For an hour.
Yeah, he showed us all these pictures of the snails, and he called them ""the littlest victims.""
Well, hopefully donger will be less annoying from now on.
Yeah, hopefully.
Wait, ""from now on""?
Yeah. Yup. No. No, no, no, no.
Please tell me I don't have to keep working with that...
Danger: Detective Peralta.
Hi.
Love your precinct.
Very primitive.
At USPIS, everyone gets his own office, but that's because we're this proud nation's first defense in the war on terror.
Every envelope is a potential target for Al-Qaeda.
Oh.
Detective Rosa Diaz, meet my new partner, Jack donger.
Please, I go by Jackie.
Jackie donger.
Of course you do.
[Singing along to marching band music]
Take it away, Peralta.
Will do.
Shouldn't have done that.
B-side's got some banging sousa deep cuts.
Thank God we're here. Look, there's a box up there.
Oh, yeah, that is some sweet green curves right there.
We should talk to the falafel guy, see if he's seen anything suspicious.
Uh, you should probably let me take lead on this.
A lot of people don't like cops, but everybody loves postal workers.
They do?
That's why the phrase most associated with bringing goodness into people's lives is ""going postal.""
[Chuckles] You're kidding, right?
""Going postal"" means that...
I know what it means!
I just said what it means. That's what it means.
[Laughs]
Okay.
Well, howzabout we avoid human contact altogether and check out the box?
What's the point of that thing?
Tradition and security.
Plus, I'd be lying if I said it didn't look insanely cool.
I wouldn't.
Jackpot. It's giggle pig.
Yes!
You have served your country proud, little lady.
Stop!
Whoa!
Ow, ow, ow, help me up!
Peralta, help! Help me up.
Don't ditch me!
[Groans] He's gone.
You okay?
No, I'm rattled.
Hey. Hmm?
Where you going, Amy?
Oh, I was just going outside to...
See this pigeon I've been training.
It does the can-can.
That I gotta see!
Damn it. I made my lie too enticing.
Fine, I was going out to smoke.
Your lame system-reboot thing didn't work.
You know, I don't like to talk about this, but many years ago, I myself overcame an addiction.
I could not get enough of the ponies.
Go, razzmataz.
Go, razzmataz. Go, razzmataz.
Sports announcer: It's bugle boy, winning by a head.
I lost everything.
What worked for me was replacing my bad addiction with a good addiction...
Exercise.
Grab your sneakers, Santiago.
You're going me on a lunchtime jog.
Great! We can talk a little, chat about the job, do some mentor-mentee bonding.
We will exercise in silence.
No headphones either.
Music is a crutch.
[Siren wails in distance]



I'm sorry, let me get this straight.
You had a giggle pig supplier 20 yards from you, and he got away?
What happened?
Your man here failed to follow proper law-enforcement procedure is what happened.
What?
Always check for ground-level obstructions before initiating a foot pursuit.
Jake: The ground-level obstruction was your hand clutching my leg.
I have claw marks all over my calf.
I'm sorry, Rosa, can I talk to you in private for a second?
Yeah. We'll be right back.
Boyle, why don't you show donger what a fax machine is?
Okay.
Okay, imagine a letter had unprotected s*x with a phone.
Look, it's not just that donger's annoying.
He ruined the whole operation.
The perp got away because he's the world's biggest tool.
No, tools can be useful. He's the world's smallest tool.
I'm the world's biggest tool.
God! Do you see what he's doing to me?
Look, these dealers didn't just randomly start using mailbox keys.
There's clearly a postal connection.
Sorry, dude, you gotta keep working with him.
Okay, wait, wait.
Let's just put this in perspective for a second.
Is this whole war on drugs really worth the human cost of me spending another minute with this behonkus?
I don't know what ""behonkus"" means, but yes.
""Behonkus"" means butt, and I think you could have guessed that from context.
Seriously, Jake, I'm asking you to see this through.
All right, fine.
I will do it for you as a favor because you're my friend.
But if he tells me one more time about how USPIS ""mailed down"" the Berlin wall, I'm gonna give him your home address, and you will receive holiday cards from him forever.
My own relatives don't have that address.
Oh, I know. I know.
[Watch beeps]
And completion.
[Sighs]
So how do you feel?
Really good. No nicotine cravings at all.
The magic of endorphins.
I'm in a state of total euphoria.
Clearly.
Listen, I gotta jump in there, so...
[Phone rings]
Hello, Kevin.
No, I haven't seen it.
I very much doubt that.
Why would the housekeeper steal your belt?
What husband? She's a widow.
I... uh-oh, I have to go.
Santiago, are you smoking in there?
No.
Why do I see smoke?
That's steam. I'm in the shower.
So what are a bunch of drug dealers doing with old postal keys?
Maybe you guys forgot to collect them all.
Mm, barking up the wrong tree, McGruff.
Postal service doesn't make mistakes.
You lose millions of letters every year. Really?
Then explain to me why none of these missing letters have ever been found.
Okay, if it wasn't a mistake, maybe it was an inside job.
Who collected the keys?
There are five people responsible for key collection in the city.
Boom! That's our list of suspects.
We shall call them ""the fellowship of the key.""
I honestly think you are the greatest man who ever lived.
Oh.
That's a no-go.
Tracking these people down is a waste of time.
I say we keep surveilling the mailboxes.
Look, I have worked a ton of these drug cases, all right?
Once they know we're onto them, they burn the whole system.
Trust me, they're done with the boxes.
Trust me. I'm a federal agent.
You're not FBI. You're not ATF.
You work for the post office.
Your motto is ""surprisingly, we exist.""
Incorrect.
Our motto is ""nos custodimus quod lingus.""
""We guard what you lick.""
That's worse!
No, forget it.
I'm not giving you the list of names.
We're gonna keep surveilling those mailboxes, and if nothing turns up after a couple of days, then we'll go on your wild goose chase.
Hey, if you're hungry, Maury went postal and brought in muffins for everyone.
Sweet.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go grab a muff with some bluebs, and when I get back, we will discuss strategy for the stakeouts.
All right, guard the door.
I'm gonna print out this list of suspects, and then we are ditching donger.
It's kind of risky, Jake.
If this ends up being a dead end, Rosa's gonna be mad.
You know, robo-partner would not question this for a moment.
Fine, I'll be lookout.
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake! What? Is he coming?
No, but there's more than muffins.
[Sniffs] There's banana bread too!
What?
This printer is so slow!
Come on.
Ugh, this place is the worst!
All right, two down, three to go.
Next on the list, Kent Delroy.
Worked at the post office for 12 years.
Quit two years ago.
That's the guy from this morning.
NYPD, open up!
All right, I'm gonna break down the door.
No, let me do it.
Charles, that's never gone well.
Yes, but I've been practicing.
All right, fine. You get one try.
Thank you.
Police! Hands in the air!
I did it! Yes!
Boyle, that's the bad guy.
Yup, yup. Turn around.
This way, Santiago.
Amy: What's going on?
Is this a dream?
No, I'm not holding a label maker.
Silence before the shaman.
Amy, I'm taking charge of your journey away from addiction.
Gina is leading you on a guided mediation.
Terry and I agreed to participate as a show of support.
Okay.
And, Amy, you don't know this 'cause I don't necessarily enjoy talking to you, but in my early 20s, I too battled an addiction.
I was a compulsive shopper.
Anyway, meditation helped me past that addiction.
And it's gonna do the same for you.
Close your eyes and repeat: I am in a vast hallway.
All: I am in a vast hallway.
I walk into the light of self-actualization.
All: I walk into the light of self-actualization.
For I am a powerful woman.
For I am a powerful woman.
I'm not hearing everyone.
Terry and Holt: For I am a powerful woman.
You feel the cool breeze of enlightenment gently caressing your face.
I feel it!
I feel the breeze.
Amy!
What? I'm not the one with my eyes open.
Cheater!
Captain Holt is cheating.
Santiago, we're trying to help you.
I can't do it.
I quit quitting.
Hey, hey, people.
Task force, officially on the scoreboard with our first major giggle pig dealer busted.
[Cheering]
Treat him well.
This guy is sort of the Mitch Globmun of getting put in jail for this.
Globmun was the first kid in my grade to get a pube.
Rosa, great news, my friend!
What the hell?
Donger just called and said you abandoned him, took information from a classified computer, and licked a roll of antique stamps.
The stamps were on me.
I was curious about how old glue tasted.
Answer: Like a horse lollipop.
Mm.
Look, it's not a big deal.
Donger wanted us to waste a week staring at mailboxes.
If I'd listened to him, I never would have caught Delroy.
Or found his books, which tell us there's a huge giggle pig shipment coming in tonight.
I told you to work with USPIS.
Okay, I know I didn't do it exactly the way you asked me to...
The way I ordered you to as leader of the task force.
Do you think just because we're friends you can do whatever you want?
Donger's furious. He's on his way over here now because they're taking over the case.
What! He can't do that.
Yeah, he can.
They're a federal agency.
From now on, any bust that comes from this, including Delroy, goes to USPIS.
My task force gets nothing. So thanks, friend.
This table tastes like Scully's elbow blisters.
It's horrible and I deserve it.
I hate seeing you like this.
Rosa has every right to be pissed at me.
I didn't follow her orders and I messed up the task force.
The only way to make things right is to do the worst, most awful thing imaginable.
Dip your pen1s in vinegar.
What? No!
Why would you say that?
In sunday school, they told us the babylonians did that to their enemies.
I've been terrified ever since.
Okay, well, what I have to do is far, far worse.
I'm sorry I was a jerk.
I'm sorry I said the postman was a flop.
I'm sorry I said ""forever"" stamps are a lie because the earth will eventually be swallowed by the sun.
I know what you're trying to do and I'm not buying it for a second.
I don't think you're sorry and I don't think you respect USPIS.
Maybe at first, but that was before I read, ""stamping out crime: A history of the USPIS.""
Oh, great read!
Yeah.
But it actually just scratches the surface.
The real story begins in the 16th century with la poste francaise.
Do you wanna hear about it?
Absolutely. Please tell us that story.
And spare no detail.
The vinegar dip.
But this is when USPIS history gets really good.
They actually moved the headquarters back to Boston from Washington D.C.
Let's jump ahead to 1820...
Wait, you're just gonna jump a whole decade?
I mean, I'm dying to know how the chief postal inspector's sickly wife adjusted to the cold new England winters.
Okay, Peralta, I accept your apology.
You can have the case back.
Oh, thank you.
Truth is, I need some help.
Delroy won't tell us where the shipment's going tonight and his notebooks are all in code.
Have a look.
Have you checked out this phone number?
It doesn't exist.
Ten digits, what else could it be?
Two zip codes back-to-back.
But they're nowhere near here.
27889, that's Washington, north Carolina.
80751, that's sterling, Colorado.
Sterling place and Washington Avenue.
Wait a minute, Mr. postman!
That's where the giggle pig delivery's gonna be?
Yup. We gotta go, right now.
Could you please knock it off?
It's like working inside a beaver dam.
Oh no, a next-to-desk-sit-down.
Santiago, you're putting yourself under too much pressure.
And that stress is making it even harder for you to quit.
Some things might come easier to you if you stop being such a perfectionist.
A concept you should become familiar with.
""Familiar with?""
Mm.
A dangling preposition?
I'm setting an example.
I made an error and I'm not going to correct it.
I'm just gonna let it dangle...
Dangle...
Dangle.
Thank you, Captain.
Okay, get ready, it's going down.
Wait, before we go in there...
Apology accepted.
No, I actually want to do it.
Ugh, so I have to suffer?
I'll make it quick.
I didn't follow your orders, I took advantage of our friendship, I'm a jerk, I'm sorry.
So that's what eternity feels like.
I could not have made that any shorter.
All right, what's the plan? This dong is ready to ding.
What?
Tac team one will take the north entrance.
Tac team two will take the east door.
Jake, you stay out here and man the radio.
Oh, sure, whatever you need. On it.
No, I'm just kidding, you're coming in with us.
Jerk.
Rosa: Ready? On my count.
Three, two, one.
Rosa: Freeze, police!
Danger: Also USPIS. And USPIS.
Down, down, down!
Go out the back door!
Rosa: Down, down, get down!
Unh!
Hands on your head!
Unh. What happened?
You hit your head on the doorway coming in.
Got knocked out cold.
Do I have a bruise?
A little one.
Yes! I'm going on the wall of heroes.
Did we catch all the bad guys?
Yup, we got 'em.
All right, another win for USPIS.
You're lying in rat turds.
It's all part of the job, little brother.
It's all part of the job.

Morning, detectives.
Let's go over the prisoner transfer upstate.
Perp's name is Jesse Hermick.
We arrested him for nine counts of armed robbery, but he skipped bail.
He was just picked up in Neustadter, New York, trying to pay for a hoagie with a gun.
The sheriff is making us pick him up tomorrow morning at 6:30 A.M., so we're going up today and spending the night.
Here are the transfer forms. Please don't...
Get any Jake on them?

It's almost like it's haunted by fancy ghosts.
I don't mind at all.
It's actually really cute of you.
Teddy's never done anything that spontaneous or romantic.

NYPD! Hands up!
[Screams]
This is great.
I had no idea Captain Holt was interested in food.
I have zero interest in food.
If it were feasible, my diet would consist entirely of flavorless beige smoothies containing all the nutrients required by the human animal.
So our bank got some new ATMs, huh?
I wouldn't know. I've switched banks.
Oh, no. Anyway...
Tomorrow's my anniversary with Kevin.
I'd like to cook him an impressive breakfast.
Could you help orient me with that process?
I'd be honored.
Preparing food for one's lover is the most intimate gift of all.
Aside from washing their hair.
Okay. [Coughs]
I have a perp in the interrogation room.
I need all the files...
Terry: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Diaz?
Are you sick? Do you have cholera?
Is it typhoid? [Gasps]
Are you a vampire?
My horoscope said to wear a cowl-neck today, and I laughed.
I'm fine.
Diazes don't get sick.
[Sneezes]
[Sniffles]
This is allergies.
No, that's what killed the dinosaurs.
You need to go home.
Can't. My drug task force needs a win.
That perp in there has the name of a giggle pig supplier.
I leave when I get a name.
[Coughs]
At least let me buy you some matzo ball soup.
It's very soothing.
You know what?
I'm gonna go to the deli anyway.
Terry loves kreplach.
Amy: Hi, Sophia.
Sophia: Hey.
There you are.
Hey, hey.
Mwah.
So I already checked us in, and I hope you don't mind, but I got us ""the room of a thousand dolls.""
Oh, sounds creepy.
Super creepy.
[Chuckles]
So I'm gonna go unpack, and then I'm gonna take a bath, and then we have dinner, and then...
Doin' it.
I was gonna say ""dessert.""
Oh. Synonym. Cool. Better.
Hey, Amy. I'll see you later.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, hey, before I forget, try to be in the lobby in about a half an hour.
I got you a little surprise.
No.
Your surprises are always terrible.
What's going on? You have to tell me.
You're gonna love this.
Remember how you said that Teddy would never be so romantic as to turn a work trip upstate into a lover's retreat to the country?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
I called him before we left.
He's on his way here now.
Uh, you're welcome.
Jake, I don't want to see Teddy right now.
I'm about to break up with him.
Oh, nooo...
Jake, why did you invite Teddy up here?
You poured blue soda all over my life.
I know. I'm sorry, all right?
I was just trying to help.
Two maple-tinis.
Look at that.
Is that real syrup?
Right. Sorry.
Disaster at hand.
Look, what happened with you guys?
I thought you were solid.
Didn't you just get a joint library card?
Don't remind me.
I'm gonna be untangling that web for a month. Okay.
There's just no spark between us anymore.
We have different interests.
All he wants to do with his free time is make and bottle pilsners.
Yeah, that guy is obsessed with yeast.
It's all we talk about.
Jake, this is gonna be a disaster.
This is fine, all right? I'll figure it out.
I'm just gonna call Teddy, tell him to turn around and go home.
No. He's a really good Detective.
He'll figure out something's wrong.
I had an airtight breakup plan in place.
I made a reservation next thursday at a well-lit Korean restaurant in midtown.
It's the least romantic place I could think of.
Scully's bathroom. But go on.
Teddy's a really good guy.
I don't want to say the wrong thing and hurt him more than I have to.
That's why I started writing out a breakup speech, but now he's on his way, and I'm only halfway through the outline.
All right, look, this is totally my fault, so I promise, I'll do everything I can to help.
Tonight, I will focus solely on you and Teddy.
[Cell phone jingles]
And my very naked girlfriend.
Wow.
Sophia does not care about the cloud at all.
I'm gonna just head up there for a sec.
Hey.
What did you do to that perp?
I heard he's claiming police brutality.
He's an idiot. I didn't touch him.
I just coughed on him a little.
Just let me help you.
I'll get your perp to talk.
I can be very persuasive.
I just negotiated my baby girls down from a pony to a hamster.
[Chuckling] Little fools.
I don't need your help, because I am not sick.
Gina, where is the cold medicine?
I hate to point out the obvi-o-so, but why do you need the meds if you're not sick, hmm?
To fight off the cold symptoms that my healthy body is exhibiting.
I'm going back in there once this crap dries my head up.
Demon.
Okay, if Diaz won't accept our help, we got to go behind her back.
We definitely should go behind her back.
That's the opposite side of where the germs are coming from.
Knock-knock. Man, I...
Oh, dolls! Dolls!
Too many dolls!
I know.
I thought it would be funny, but it's just really scary.
One of them watched me bathe.
Yeah, we should definitely turn them around.
Yeah.
Oh, no, they have their names written on the back.
[Creepily] I'm Meredith.
Will you be my mother?
[Growls]
[Laughing] Oh, God.
Oh, okay, look.
The dolls are gross, but I think once we bury them, this place could be kind of romantic.
Yeah, totally. Yeah.
But you know what would be even more romantic is hanging out, fully clothed, with two other people who have fallen out of love.
What did you do?
[Sighs] All right, don't be mad.
I invited Teddy up to surprise Amy, but it turns out she wants to break up with him.
And now I promised her that I would run interference, and I feel like I let you and all of our demon children down.
Oh, it's okay.
You were just trying to do something really nice for a friend, and it blew up in your face rather spectacularly.
Everything I do is spectacular. It's a curse.
Thank you for being understanding.
Yeah, well, for the record: Very cool girlfriend. The coolest.
Hey, and Teddy doesn't get here for another 30 minutes.
Till then...
Let's make out? Great plan.
[Chuckles]
Ah.
[Sighs]
Eh.
In the closet where they can't watch us?
Yep. Smart.
[Yells] Puppets!
Oh, there's so many puppets in there.
Now, the first step in learning how to cook is learning how to taste.
So close your eyes and open your mouth.
This isn't burning man, Boyle.
Tell me what I'm eating.
Fine. It's a sharp Vermont Cabot.
Now describe what you taste.
Cheese.
And...
Cheese.
Okay. That's good.
But try being more descriptive.
I know you love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Why?
Their components have a long shelf life, they're cost-effective, and they're so simple, a child could make them.
Okay, I was looking for more of an emotional connection.
For example, my favorite meal is a simple roast chicken and potatoes.
It was the only dish my mother knew how to cook, and when I eat it, I feel as though I am once again inside her womb.
What's your story behind a PB&J?
I want a sandwich.
I make a sandwich.
I eat the sandwich.
Come on, Claire!
I thought you came to play.



Yikes. Where's Teddy?
Amy: He's in the shower.
I said hi to him, we chatted for, like, a minute, and I almost blew it.
Oh, I'm sure you're overstating that.
He said he was really looking forward to a romantic evening, and I panicked and yelled ""l-o-l.""
[Chuckles] Oh.
Oh.
I'm gonna be weird, he's gonna ask why, we're gonna break up, and it's gonna be super messy.
Just calm down.
We're gonna get you through this, okay?
Here's the plan.
The four of us will dine together and keep things super unromantic.
I'm great at that. Yeah, he is.
Whoo!
Wait, should we have high-fived that?
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Oh, also, if you feel like you're losing control, just say the word ""Jericho,"" and I'll pull out all the stops.
Oh, Jericho. Safe word.
I love that. Right?
All right, so after dinner, pretend you're sick and say you want to go straight to bed.
Me and you have to pick up the perp super early in the morning, so you only have to act normal around Teddy from the elevator to the room.
Do you think you can do that?
Yes?
Yes. Say, ""yes, I can do it.
I can be normal.""
Yes, I can do it.
I can be normal. There you go.
I can totally be normal.
Hey, everybody.
There he is!
Teddy in the house!
Who knew a prisoner transfer could be like a vacation, huh?
[Chuckles] Hey, man.
Thanks a lot for telling me to come up here.
Yup, that was great of me.
This place is really romantic.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, not that romantic, actually.
The radiator in our room sounds like a woman screaming.
Yeah, oh, and there was a dead crow in our toilet.
You should complain about that.
Our place is really nice. It's got a fireplace.
I'm gonna snuggle up next to that thing with you.
No, I don't want to do that.
'Cause of the cancer risks.
Most people don't know this, but sitting by a fire is actually worse than sucking on a tailpipe of a bus.
Ah, because of the germs.
Fumes.
Oh.
You know, when we first started dating, Amy and I found this really nice B&B up in the Poconos.
We got that sweet city employee discount.
Remember that, babe?
Teddy, think fast. Drink menu.
Ow.
I'm sorry, man. Chucked that right at you.
I just thought you really wanted a drink.
I never need a drink menu.
I got the thrills for the pils.
[Chuckles] 'Cause I'm a pilsner man.
Oh, I hadn't heard.
That's it.
I can't stop myself.
Jericho. Jericho. Jericho.
[Grunts] Ow!
That's pulling out all the stops?
What's going on?
I want to break it up.
Us.
I want to break us up.
Hey, folks.
Welcome to the maple drip inn.
Everyone excited to be here?
We having a good time?
We are not.
All right, Gina.
We have to act soon.
That cold medicine Diaz chugged...
It was the non-drowsy kind.
She's all over the place.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Guess what.
I got a new lead to ask my perp about.
It's a drug dealer on state street.
[Phone ringing]
Oh!
Why doesn't someone answer that phone?
Get it. I'll get it.
[Flatly] Hello.
No, there's no Michael here.
You have the wrong number. Good-bye.
I'm Michael.
That's a dumb name, but it's yours, and you should be proud of it because you are the greatest Detective I've ever known.
No doy, Diaz. No doy.
Where is my file? Yeah.
She's so hopped up on that stuff, her brain's gonna blow.
I'm gonna interrogate the perp.
You keep Diaz occupied.
I don't want to get near her germ face.
Permission to lock her in a distant room?
No. Just distract her.
Yes. That is what I will do.
Rosa, come here.
Got to tell you something. It's a secret.
Okay, but I have a lot of stuff to do.
What's the secret? What's the secret?
What's the secret?
Here it is. See? Gina.
Let me out of here. I got to talk to my perp.
Shh.
You know, many people think that scrambled eggs are the easiest food to make, but that is incredibly foolish.
They are a highly nuanced and complicated dish.
Okay, now, go ahead and pour your eggs right into the pan, nice and slow.
[Eggs sizzling]
Oh.
Okay, now what do I do? Oh, boy.
Okay, well, you hear that sizzle?
That means the heat is a little too high on those eggs.
Well, the higher the heat, the faster the eggs cook, the sooner Kevin eats.
Am I incorrect?
No, you make an excellent point, but we don't want to feed Kevin burned garbage.
Cooking is about patience.
Are you completely insane?
You never salt can to pan.
The hand... The hand is the middle man.
Okay?
What you did is the culinary equivalent of unprotected s*x.
You know what?
You, sir, are not ready to scramble eggs.
Hand over your spatula.
Fine.
I only wish in return I could get back all the time I just wasted on this futile project.
I'm just gonna make Kevin plain toast for breakfast.
Oh, that is low.
Hey, Boyle. I smell burning.
Is Hitchcock roasting corn on the radiator again?
No.
What you smell is the burning wreckage of my relationship with Holt.
So there's no corn on the cob?
The main reason you want to break up with me is the pilsners?
I-I like other drinks.
[Chuckles]
It's delicious. I want more.
It's not just the pilsners.
There are so many reasons I want to break up.
That sounded bad, didn't it?
As a lawyer, it's my duty to tell you to shh.
Okay, look.
There's just no spark between us.
That's vague.
Uh, you're... Boring.
No, that's too harsh.
This is why I wanted to write it down.
Can I maybe just have two hours alone with my laptop, so I can type up a draft?
Great idea.
In the meantime, we can just chat.
You know what? We should go.
No, actually, I think you should stay, so we can all talk about the real reason there's a problem in my relationship with Amy, which is you, Jake.
Buh... what now, huh?
About how you told her that you liked her before you went undercover.
You liked Amy? Um...
I did, but that was many moons ago.
Was it?
'Cause I know for a fact you also told her when you got back, and every time you would, she would get ""confused,"" and then our relationship would get ""out of sync,"" and if you ask me, I think it's because Amy liked you back.
Did you?
Maybe. Yes.
A little.
I mean, I was confused.
And I really need my laptop right now.
You know what, this is officially too much for me, so I'm gonna go upstairs and rip the heads off some dolls.
Good night.
I'm gonna leave too.
If you would please leave my toothbrush and my home brewing kit at the doorstep, I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Well, I guess that's the last time I invite Teddy on a trip, right?
[Chuckles]
♪ Drama ♪
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, it's me.
Please open the door.
Come on, let's talk.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, you're not Sophia.
Sophia: Hey, Jake. Over here, man.
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.
You were a wrong door.
You were a wrong door.
[Scoffs]
That's a very angry man.
Look, I know what that sounded like at dinner, but I promise you, I am not into Amy.
It's not what I heard, Jake.
It's what I saw.
You should've seen the look on your face when you found out Amy liked you.
[Groans] Listen to me.
""Liked""? I'm an adult.
All this who-likes-who stuff sounds very High School.
I know, it's stupid. You're totally right.
But the point is, I like you.
And you're sure you're over Amy?
Yes.
I mean, I didn't knock on Amy's door.
I knocked on yours.
Actually, you knocked on his door.
And I'm pretty sure he's listening.
Hugo: No, I'm not.
Who's Amy?
Yeah. Come on in.
Thank you.
[Yells] The puppets are on the bed.
Good morning, Boyle.
Oh, good morning, Captain Holt.
After our disagreement yesterday, I went online to read your culinary blogs and scoff.
To my dismay, I actually learned something about how food tells a story, so I made Kevin this.
It's warm.
It's a croque monsieur.
Kevin and I shared one on a rainy afternoon in Paris on our first anniversary.
It's one of our most treasured memories.
I'm sure it's not up to your standards, but Kevin seemed to enjoy it.
So thank you for your guidance.
It's gross, huh?
No.
It's perfect.
He's a natural chef.
Now I know how salieri felt.
Everything okay with Diaz?
Yeah, she fell asleep five minutes after I locked her in, and she hasn't moved in the past ten hours.
She talks in her sleep.
I'm gonna rip your head off.
I'm gonna rip your damn head off, grandma.
Oh, tare-bear, what if she sleeps forever?
[Both scream]
Oh, God!
Oh, look, it's Rosa!
You look great, girl.
I got to get out of here. Bye.
You better not run, because I will catch you.
After I'm done crushing that perp, you're next.
I already interrogated the perp for you.
You what?
I got him to name his giggle pig supplier.
It's all good.
Now go home and get better.
I could've done it myself.
No, you couldn't have.
You literally have been in a coma since yesterday.
Now, I know you like to act like you don't need any help, but we all do.
I ask five dudes to spot me when I'm doing my squats.
Terry paid me $20 to lock you up.
No, I did not.
But I took that cheddar, and I made you this special ""Rosa's gonna make this cold her bitch"" care package.
Now's the time when you say ""thank you for all your help.""
Thank you for all your help.
Wait, is that a smile I see?
Possibly.
My immune system is too weak to fight off my smile muscles.
You okay?
Want some blue?
Sure.
Wow, last night really broke you, huh?
Actually, I think it was probably for the best.
I'm glad I got it over with. Totally.
Sometimes you got to just rip off the band-aid and let the scab bleed all over the place.
That's not the expression at all.
I'm 100% it is.
[Chuckles quietly]
So how'd it go with Sophia?
Good. We made up.
We're still together.
I told her, you know, everything with me and you is in the past, and we're just friends, so...
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I am thrilled to know that you used to like me, and I will bring it up constantly.
Great.
Hey, should we make a left up here at you-used-to-like-me lane, or...
Ha, ha.
I could always just cut across at Amy-used-to-like-Jake boulevard.
Okay, stop it, or I'll crash the car.
Don't do that. [Tires squeal]

Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Whoa, thank you, good sir!
The elves will not starve this night.
Any sign of our bogie?
Rosa: Negative.
Are you sure our guy's gonna show?
Jake: My C.I. said he walked this route exactly the last three days.
Fine, but in ten minutes, we're calling this.
I have to get back to my ecstasy task force.
We have to bag a major giggle pig player soon, or they're gonna shut us down.
Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
Presents!
Rosa: God, you're bad at being Santa.
Jake, holy crap, 9:00.
Jake: The Pontiac bandit, aka Doug Judy.
Okay, Santa, stay calm, just like we practiced.
Merry Judy, Mr. Doug Judy Christmas.
Damn it! Peralta?
No!
Onion ring attack!
Ah! Greasy!
NYPD! Stop where you are!
Come on, Santa. Why are you so fat?
NYPD. Clear out.
Where are you?
Ah!
Ah! Got you!
[Both grunting]
[People gasping]
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.
Put your hands in the air.
Hey, Rosa. Merry Christmas, girl.
Shut up.
Jake: Take a good look, kids.
This is what happens when you're naughty!
♪ ♪
Holt: Attention, everyone.
Holidays of many cultures approach.
This truly is a joyful time.
Join me for a festive winter party at Shaw's bar this friday, 7:00 till 9:00.
Any questions?
A.M. or P.M.?
I'm gonna let you figure that one out.
Also, I'd like to reiterate my gift policy: None allowed.
Enjoy this merry season.
Good people of the nine-nine, I present to you the seventh wonder of the world, Doug Judy, aka the Pontiac bandit, foiled at last!
[Cheers and applause]
All right!
Wow, you guys, thank you very much.
All right, that's enough, Judy.
This is my moment. You are not to enjoy it.
I can't help it. I'm proud of you.
You're like a son to me.
A white, crispy son.
How would that even work? Am I adopted?
No, your mother's just really pale.
Almost invisible.
Okay.
Anyways, it's a shame I gotta ruin your celebration by cutting a deal and getting out of here.
Never! Right?
I'm just saying, I know a lot of real high-profile felons.
Makes me a very desirable tattletale.
We will never cut a deal with you, not after you screwed us last year.
You don't want any info on a local burglary ring, perhaps?
Not good enough.
Testify, Captain!
How about a guy who makes fake credit cards?
Negative.
Jake: You see that, Judy?
No matter what you say, you're going to jail.
What about drugs?
Y'all ever heard of giggle pig?
What do you know?
We're listening.
No, no, no, no, no, we're not listening.
We can't hear him.
Everybody shoot your guns in the air.
Gina, you need to see this.
Oh, Charles, I can't take that.
It's clearly not cash, and I don't have time in my life to return things.
I found this at my dad's place last night.
It's from him to your mom.
No!
Yes!
Boyle, this is bad.
I thought our parents were just having a casual fling, but presents is like old people third base.
No, that's rubbing butts together.
What?
But this is very close.
Gina, they may be getting serious.
Ugh!
Don't you dare say that!
Do you know how disgustingly entangled our lives will be if our parents turn into a real couple?
Yes! You think I want you and your mom horning in on the Boyle boys mimosa brunches?
That's our guy time.
Ugh. We need to figure out what is in this horrible package, so we can determine where they're at in their relationship.
[Gasps]
What if it's a romantic book or, like, a picture of the two of them in a frame?
Oh, or ""his and hers"" pajamas?
The kind that dissolve in your mouth.
Ew, no! No, Charles, ew.
So this is where all the tape went.
I gotta put up this pictures my daughters drew.
And I need some 'cause I cut my hand.
Hitchcock!
Go to the hospital!
And give 100 bucks to some doctor to give me the exact same tape?
I don't think so.
Wow! What's all this?
I'm making a Christmas present for Captain Holt.
I know, I know.
He has a strict ""no gift"" policy, but I found a loophole.
Like your loophole last year?
So I was just gonna throw out this brand-new squash racquet, but then I thought, ""hey, maybe the Captain could use it.""
I don't want your garbage.
No, it was a very expensive gift.
Aha, suspicions confirmed.
I asked the Captain what qualified as a gift, and he said anything I spent money on.
Then I realized, my time is worth nothing.
Sounds like you're bragging, but that's just a sad statement.
I'm making a scrapbook of his professional highlights.
Newspaper clippings, police reports, pictures.
It's got every moment of his career, ""from Ray to Z.""
This is a very bad idea.
I know, I'm not happy with the title either, but my backup was ""keep holting on,"" but that just makes him sound like he's sick.
All right, before we make a deal with this evil monster, can I just ask something?
Is giggle pig really that important?
My job, Rosa's job, and the fate of this entire precinct all depend upon the outcome of this task force.
All right, fine.
Diaz, what's our status right now?
We've picked up a bunch of dealers, but our main target is Tito Ruiz.
We believe he runs the whole operation, only we can't prove it because none of his people will turn on him just because he bit off a few noses.
Babies.
I say the only way we make a deal with Doug Judy is if he can give us the top guy, Tito Ruiz.
I can give you Tito Ruiz.
Oh, come on, Judy!
I mean, how do we even know this is real?
This guy's a huckster!
He's a lie guy.
Peralta has a point.
You have been a lie guy to us before.
Thank you. Give me some details.
Ruiz and I were cellies in Attica in the '90s.
He texted me last week.
Needs some cars to deliver his product.
I said no because drugs are stupid.
Except for weed and s*x pills.
A man has needs.
♪ Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa ♪
♪ I can't think of your last name, baby ♪
Enough crooning!
Can you get us a face-to-face with Ruiz?
Yeah, but you gotta give me zero jail time.
No, that's not gonna happen.
Ha-ha! Stupid Judy.
The D.A., however, will offer a reduced sentence in return for Ruiz's arrest.
5 years instead of 20.
Oh, that's tough but fair.
I can see why you have such intense daddy-stuff with him.
Oh, yeah, the guy without a daddy is the one with daddy issues.
Explain that logic.
Since I'm going to jail, I wanna enjoy my time left on the outside.
Put me up in a five-star hotel like the Royce.
Unlimited room service and minibar privileges.
Three-star hotel like the Brooklyner.
$60 a day meal allowance. No minibar.
Four-star hotel like the Oneida.
200 in food, no minibar or alcohol, but I get to go crazy on candy and nuts.
Agreed.
Ow! Oh, one last thing.
Diaz has to be nice to me.
I want her to call me big sugar.
Ha, hugh mistake, bud.
She'll never agree to that.
No, I'm in. Let's do this, big sugar.
Ah!
Jake: What? All right, fine.
If this is going down, I wanna be on this case, and my sole focus is Doug Judy.
He never leaves my sights.
Love it! Pontiac bandit and Jake.
PB&J ride again!
♪ Reunited and it feels so good ♪
It's a duet. Get in on this.
♪ Reunited 'cause we understood ♪
No! No!
All right, big sugar.
Four-star hotel room, you happy?
Okay, okay.
Okay, flat screen TV.
King-sized bed.
Hangers you can take off the rod?
This is what's up. This place is nice.
We should settle down here, Rosa.
Now if y'all excuse me, I'ma go freshen up.
I'm feeling stanky.
Hold it! Not so fast.
What?
[Whispers] Let's make out.
[Whispers] Not yet.
All right, there's no windows. You can go in.
But leave the door open, and I'm hanging on to this.
What in the world would I do with that?
Point it at my face until my eyeballs dry out and I lose my sense of sight.
Then shove it in my mouth, so I can't yell for help, and finally run out the front door and disappear forever.
Nah, I was just gonna use it to dry my undercarriage later.
Ugh. Would you just relax, okay?
Stop being so paranoid.
I'm playing ball.
I got you.
If you'll excuse me...
All right, we can't be too careful.
Let's go over the plan one more time.
Doug Judy texts Ruiz to set up a meet.
We each have a hidden wire, and we record Ruiz talking about giggle pig, then take him down.
Tac team is on call for backup...
What are you doing? You look like a pervert.
Putting a GPS tracker in his shoe.
He is not getting away from me again, even if it means putting my favorite hand into his rotten stink-boot.
Okay.
Hoo-hoo! Did you see the menu?
Lobster thermidor. Baked Alaska.
It's so fancy, it don't even sound like food.
Here, come on. Order something.
Order it. Do it. Order it.
No, thanks. I'm on duty.
Come on, Peralta.
You gonna let the criminal have all the fun?
All right, fine.
I'll have one lobster thermidor, extra thermidor on the side.
I have no idea what I'm ordering.
Me neither. We're like culinary magellans.
You know how we take this to the next level?
Robes!
Robes!

Okay, we just unwrap it, we see what's inside, then we perfectly rewrap it.
Our parents never know what happened.
Ugh, lord, you're starting to sweat.
You're gonna blemish the wrapping paper.
You're dabbing me really hard.
You know what? This is taking too long.
Just scooch, you pooch.
You are amazing.
How did you do that?
I always open my gifts in advance, so I can rehearse my reactions and nail those Christmas-morning candids.
Check it out.
Be-wonderment. [Gasps]
Disbe-loving it.
Sparkle-surprise.
I like that. Now focus up.
Your dad got my mom...
A digital scale? That's bad.
So bad, so wonderfully bad.
Your dad might as well have circled all the parts of my mom's body he didn't like with a marker.
You did that to me.
And it didn't help at all.
Nope.
My mom is gonna hate this gift.
And she'd hate it even more if we were both there when she opened it.
Should we do a gift exchange dinner tonight with both our parents?
Great idea.
Maybe she'll slap him in the face and never talk to him again.
[Laughs]
Sparkle-surprise, for real!
Three lobster thermidors, spaghetti and meatballs, Caesar salad with tater tots instead of croutons.
Oh, that's me. Salad.
I'm trying to eat healthy.
I hear that. Your body is a temple.
All right, I'm searching it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Peralta, what you doing, putting your fingers in my fancy feast?
What?
How am I supposed to escape using a lobster?
Squeeze the lemon in my eyes, so I can't see, stab me in the jugular with a claw, and then shove the tail down my throat, so I can't scream for help.
I gotta keep my eye on you, Judy.
You're a slippery guy.
Fair enough. That I am.
But for right now, I'm all about helping you.
So why don't you just chill and eat some sexy-ass lobster?
Okay, we held up our end of the bargain.
Text Ruiz now, friend.
Fine.
[Beep]
Tito, dot, dot, dot.
You around, question mark.
Wanna meet up, period.
Speech to text, we live in a magical age.
It's like The Jetsons.
By the way, this Tito dude, he spooks real easy, so...
No, there's no way you're going in alone.
We're coming with you.
I've already got my cover story worked out.
My name is Dante Thunderstone.
I stole my first car at the tender age of nine.
You had to fend for yourself since your mother was struck by lightning.
While she was pregnant with me.
She passed. I lived.
Some say that makes Zeus my dad.
Oh!
Mythic.
That's dope.
And, Rosa, you could be my wife...
Rosa.
Why would you take your wife with you to meet a drug dealer?
'Cause we're partners in everything we do.
Aw.
[Text message alert]
Whoa. Tito wants to meet up.
Great, tell him to meet us over here.
We'll get him a lobster and a robe.
I mean no, let's go catch him in the act.
Sarge, I'm freaking out about my gift that's not technically a gift.
Somehow, that doesn't surprise me.
Something horrible has happened, and I don't know what to do.
Has Captain Holt ever told you about the Brooklyn broiler?
Yeah. Arsonist.
Burned down 12 buildings in Crown Heights.
Captain's told me about it many times.
You flamed out.
Dirt bag.
Well, I think that Captain may have made a... mistake.
What are you talking about?
I was doing follow-up research on the case for a fun ""where are they now?"" Section, and I don't think the broiler set three of the fires he was charged with.
I gotta tell the Captain.
Do you think he'll be upset?
Probably not.
I mean, he seems like the kind of laid-back guy who delights in having his mistakes exposed.
[Sighs]
Maybe next year you can do a collage about low points in his marriage.
I know you're being sarcastic, sarge, but I really do love making collages.
Doug Judy: Ruiz's bodyguards.
Prepare to be touched in some real intimate places.
I'm clean.
Watch it.
Where did you get those shoes, man?
There he is.
Tito, what's up, my man?
Doug Judy. Who are they?
That's my bodyguard, Selena.
We're doing it on the D.L.
He's an amazing lover. I'm pregnant.
Oh, nice!
And this here is my partner, Dante Thunderstone.
The one and only.
Brrrat, brrrat, brrrat!
Tito: Okay, Judy.
If we're gonna do business, I gotta see how good you really are.
This is a test.
Go jack that car right now.
Give him the tools.
[Chuckles]
[Grunts]
No worries.
That is a cinch to pinch.
There's no way you're getting in that car alone.
Hey, where are you going, Thunderstone?
To steal the car.
I jack the rides. Judy holds my tools.
Fine. Then you have two minutes.
Only need one.
That was tight.
You played him like a boss.
Thanks. Now I just need to magically learn how to steal a car.
Braat, braat!
Okay, okay, all I have to do is break into this car and drive it away without a key.
Something wrong?
Nope, just, uh, warming up my stealing fingies.
Relax, Thunderstone.
It's easy. Here.
What are you talking about?
Oh, just, uh, telling Thunderstone how I move it on the dance floor.
Always start with a side-to-side sway.
Real smooth, real slow.
Real smooth and real slow.
Yeah, and when I feel that groove, I pop it!
[Both grunt] Yeah.
And I pull it, pull it back. Pull it back hard.
Whoo! Ha-ha! Yeah.
Yes, I love the way you dance, Doug Judy.
All right, this next part is like french kissing.
Got it.
Jam it in there and move it around wildly.
I gotta ask, Peralta, do the ladies enjoy that technique?
Ten seconds.
Come on.
[Engine starts]
Ah, yes!
[Laughter]
Okay, let's go.
[Upbeat music]
Thank you, Charles, Regina, for inviting us on this double date.
Kind of like a fun Christmas four-way, right?
Well put, Lynn. Yeah.
Darlene: A very sweet sentiment.
Oh, my God! I have an idea.
Let's open presents.
Okay. Oh.
I wanna see what everyone got everyone and how everyone reacts poorly.
Fun, fun. I just hope you like it.
I don't know.
[Paper tears]
A digital scale?
Lynn Boyle, you're a horrible, horrible man.
You went way over our price limit.
Yes, I did.
And I love it! Yay!
It's gonna go so great in the guest bathroom.
Both: What?
Lynn and I are moving in together.
Lynn: Mm-hmm.
And the rent's a little steep, so we promised we would only exchange small gifts.
Mm-hmm.
But you had to push it, didn't you?
I did.
You naughty boy.
I had to get my pookums a present, pookums.
Okay, well, this is wonderful, but I am needed elsewhere, so I'm gonna take off.
Thank you so much.
Nog, nog.
Little Christmas humor. [Chuckles]
Yes, the ""nog"" from ""egg nog,"" used in place of ""knock.""
I stand corrected. He loved it.
So I was just looking through some old files, and I think I may have found a mistake in a closed case.
Which one?
It was actually... Now that I think of it, if I'm remembering correctly, and I could be wrong on this, but...
It's the Brooklyn broiler.
What? That dirtbag flamed out ages ago.
Why were you looking at that case?
She was making you a gift...
Not a gift, snitch.
It didn't cost me anything, just my worthless man-hours.
""From Ray to Z""?
I thought I told you no gifts.
Take this away, and bring me the broiler's file.
I'll look into this mistake.
Actually, the evidence is part of the scrapbook, so I have to leave the whole thing.
Fine, I'll look at the relevant pages, but as for the rest, I will not peruse.
Jake: Wow, sweet setup. What do you make here?
Don't worry about it.
Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Tito: We need 20 cars a week.
I want to use them each once, then dump 'em.
Jake: Oh, well, you picked the right man.
So are we gonna make a deal or what?
Or do I need to talk to your boss?
You can talk to me.
So you're the boss?
Yeah, I'm the boss, and this is my place.
And in my place, people know they shouldn't ask dumb questions.
Got it?
Yeah, I got it.
I tried to tell him, Tito.
All right, let's talk deets.
[All shout]
Is that us?
No, we gotta go right now! Go, go, go!
On the ground! NYPD!
NYPD. Nobody move!
[Both grunt]
Diaz!
Don't need help. Behind you.
Bye bye, Peralta. Here's your GPS.
No!
Let's go!
[Grunts] Ha-ha, I got you!
Yeah, you did, but your boy Tito's getting away.
[Grunts]
Damn it! Damn you, Doug Judy!
I'll never forget you, Dante Thunderstone!
[Both grunting]
You have the right to remain Doug Judy.
Anything you Doug or Judy can be used against you in a Doug of Judy.
Sorry, I'm preoccupied by someone who will remain nameless.
I'll start over.
Santiago, I want to thank you for my gift.
You like the scrapbook? I don't know.
I'm a man of my word, so I did not peruse.
The gift I'm referring to was you pointing out my mistake.
Do you know why I don't accept gifts?
Because you're so evolved, you don't need material things.
Because I don't like brown-nosing.
Oh.
Youch, that was hard to watch.
You told me to my face that I made a mistake, and that's as far from brown-nosing as one can get.
I respect you for that.
Now I have a gift for you.
I have the complete Brooklyn broiler files.
He was given three life sentences, and it should have been two.
So I've already contacted the D.A. about the error.
Will you please help me figure out who set those other fires?
Ooh! More work!
I know that sounded sarcastic, but...
Nobody thought that.
Not for a moment.
Great.
[Mouthing word]
Chaz-ma-taz, how we doing, baby?
I thought you'd be in an awful mood.
Why would be upset when I've never had more purpose in my entire life?
Are you gonna poison my dad?
No, our parents say they're in love, but we both know that's just their old brains disintegrating.
We need to break them up for their sake, for our sake, for the sake of this great nation.
Agreed.
Ew! I forgot how clammy your hands are.
[Gasps]
Mood unaffected. Mood unaffected.
Attention please! Attention.
I'm sorry to interrupt your holiday revelry.
It truly is a fun night.
I'd like to propose a toast to Detective Diaz and her task force, who successfully brought down Tito Ruiz and his entire giggle pig network.
Great work, everyone. Drink up!
All: Yeah!
Hey, so I checked again.
Doug Judy still hasn't surfaced.
Yeah, he has.
He just sent me this.
Doug Judy: What's up, Peralta?
Greetings from paradise.
Actually, I'm a little disappointed in the hotel.
How do you mess up an omelet?
It's just a flat egg.
He pretty much just talks about the omelet for the next ten minutes, but...
About my escape.
This is my associate Kyle.
He drove the garbage truck.
You may also remember him as the room service waiter I had you tip so generously.
Son of a bitch.
Yup, and when he ordered the lobster, it was code for Kyle to follow him.
Anyway, tell Diaz she loves me.
Merry Christmas!
Hey, first things first.
I swear to you we are gonna catch Doug Judy.
Yeah, I know.
We did it once. We can do it again.
No. We will catch him.
More importantly, thank you.
I know how hard that was to make that choice and let him get away.
No, it was an easy call.
I know how much this task force means to you.
It means so much, and it's been so stressful, and it went so well.
Seriously, look at me, I cannot stop smiling.
How do people do this with their faces?

Good morning, Diaz, Peralta.
Captain. You're smiling.
It's very weird, like seeing a turtle out of its shell.
I'm happy.
Our drug task force was a success, and today, I get to watch my Nemesis, Madeline Wuntch, drape a medal around my neck.
Also, we cleaned up the streets.
Yeah, sure. That's good too.
So I've been planning how to zing Madeline when she puts the medal on.
I have the perfect line.
""Wuntch-time is over.""
It's a... It's a play on ""lunch time.""
Yes, devastating burn, sir.
But you know what would really show her is if you said nothing at all.
Oh, interesting. Interesting. [Laughs]
Let Madeline know she's not even worth my staying up all night crafting zingers.
""Wuntch-time"" took you all night?
Trust me. Turn the other cheek.
Which I recently learned is about faces and not butts, but works either way.
Yes.
I should be the bigger person.
That shouldn't be hard, given that Madeline's not technically a person.
For meritorious service, the NYPD bestows this award on detectives Rosa Diaz, Jake Peralta, and Captain...
Raymond Holt.
Raymond. Madeline.
You won.
Go ahead and gloat, you toad.
Thank you for this honor, deputy chief.
Oh. Okay.
You're welcome.
Wuntch-time is over.
Boom! Did it! [Laughs]
Had it both ways.
No regrets.

Listen up, gang.
We have intel on a drop house used by Alexei Bisko, a Captain in the Ukrainian mafia.
Oh, he should be psyched.
That's a very up-and-coming mafia.
His soldiers use the site to drop off money and pick up weapons.
We need a couple of teams to do long-term stakeouts.
I'm out.
Four hours is the most I've ever spent alone with any human.
It was the worst experience of my life.
What about that time we drove out to Boston together?
That was about four hours.
Oh, I see what just happened.
The only decent vantage is this condemned hotel across the street.
We can go in as exterminators, but too much movement will look suspicious.
It's an eight-day op, so two teams will do four days each.
Boyle and I are in.
Okay, that's one team.
Who wants to relieve them?
If extraction is a risk, the two of us can do the full eight days.
A Hanukkah miracle.
No, that is too long to be holed up together like that.
I did a six-day stakeout once.
Did not go well.
Well, that's not gonna be a problem for us.
The only time I ever yelled at Charles was cheering him on at his roller boogie competition.
We never fight.
It won't be a stakeout, it'll be a stake-cation.

Terry, I will not leave your side until there are no secrets between us.

It's a suit of armor.
Pantsuit of armor.
The drawings look like you two, but only because it's easier for me to draw from real life.

Tiny squirrel is Charles, the walrus is Captain Holt, and the hippo with heads on both ends, that's Hitchcock and Scully.
How do they defecate?
It's a kid's book, Santiago!
This is why I didn't want to show it to people.
Pickin' it apart.
Oh.
Oh, my God, did you carry us up here like suitcases?
No, man.
This is real life.
I rolled you in on the cart.
Boo!
Terry sucks! Terry sucks!
Terry's great. Terry's great.
Where do you want the food?
And does braided herring and jellied starfish count as food?
Oh, indeed it does.
I may be stuck in a tiny room, but my palate will travel the world.
Terry: Listen up.
This is a real small room.
If you start getting on each other's nerves, do what I do with my babies: Go to separate corners.
We call it ""alone zones.""
All due respect, sarge, but we don't need ""alone zones.""
No, we do not.
But let me ask you a question.
How do we feel about scone zones?
I feel great about it.
Me too.
Sarge?
I'm a muffin guy.
Boo! Boo!
Great news, my friend.
We have a bathroom pet.
His name is Horace, and he's either a small rat or a large cockroach, and he's either sleeping or dead.
Here's the schedule: Eight hours both on watch; Eight hours I sleep, you watch; Eight hours you sleep, I watch.
I set an alarm.
I made the perfect ringtone.

Wow.
That sleep apnea mask is something else, huh?
[Sighs]
I got to say, ever since I got her... Her?
She touches my lips, Jake.
She's a her.
And since she took up residence on my face, I sleep like a baby.
Okay.
Well, while you slept, there was some action at the drop site.
A blue sedan pulled up.
I got the plates and the driver's face.
Also, this is the guy who runs the drop house.
I call him ""the beach umbrella"" because he looks so shady.
Oh.
[Munching loudly]
Hey, this is a kind of weird request, but would you maybe mind chewing your nortfluskers with your mouth closed?
I can't, and I'm excited to tell you why.
I have a new eating method.
I realized that open mouths oxygenate the food, so it's kind of like wine tasting.
And I hear you, buddy.
I really do.
It's just... It's pretty gross, so maybe just while we're together, you could keep the old chewer shut?
Okay, but I don't complain about how gross your meal is.
What's gross about pancakes with butter and maple syrup?
You've completely abandoned the pancake part.
Now you're just eating butter with syrup on it.
Yeah, I cut out the carbs.
This is me being healthy.
Okay, well, maybe we just eat in separate corners of the room.
Great. I love that plan.
Wait! That's alone zones.
We don't need alone zones.
We're fine. We're not fighting.
We're great. Eat your butter-syrup.
Yeah, keep that chew hole open. [Chuckles]

God, how did humans get it so backwards?

Oh, that... It's not a big deal.
We're not gonna start fighting. We never fight.
Yeah, totally. Yeah.
That's what I was thinking.
But just to be safe, we could write down some of each other's annoying behaviors that we want to be off-limits, you know?
We could call it ""the no-no list.""
Oh, I love it.
Okay, so here's what I've got for you.
No eating with your mouth open.
We knew that.
No rasta-man voice, no reciting poetry, no ballroom dancing, no bird calls, and no male kegels.
Can I do my kegels secretly? Watch this.
You'll never know I'm doing them.
I can definitely tell.
All right, give me my no-no's.
Okay, no butter-syrup, no talking about Die Hard...
Okay. I can do that.
Or Die Hard two or Die Hard three.
What? Come on.
So you just want me to talk about the fourth one?
There's a fourth one? Charles!
No judging me for not knowing the Die Hards.
All right, fine. What else? Okay.
No eating mayonnaise straight from the jar, no using my toothbrush.
And that's it.
Jake, this no-no list, it's a slam dunk.
Oop me.

I'm getting better.
Yeah, you are.



Rosa: You wanted to see me, sir?
Have a seat, Diaz.
You remember my nephew Marcus? The 31-year-old?
He asked me to ask you if you are single.
I'm told him I'm not a third-grade girl with pigtails passing love notes.
Yeah, it's so immature.
Precisely. It's embarrassing.
Agreed.
I am single.
Oh.
I see.
But if Marcus wants my number, he can ask me for it.
But who will tell him that?
Um, yeah.
You took the last danish.
Oh, sorry.
Did you read Terry's book about us?
No. He said not to read it.
Okay, fine, I read it.
My character, cricket, is such a pushover.
She just lets all the forest folk take her magic moose wishes.
Well, june bug is a stone-cold bitch.
She told all the baby platy-pups they had weird feet.
Is that how people see us?
Well, you did just steal that danish out of my hand and start eating it.
And I let you.
And apologized.
Classic cricket move.
Hey, can I just scootch in there to the coffee?
You can scootch your ass back in line.
My coffee needs are just as important as yours.
What was that all about?
Terry, I try not to judge people, so I wouldn't know.
Maybe I should go check on little Amy and give her the greatest gift of all...

Hey, bud, is rhyming on your no-no list?
No.
Cool, cool.
Just seems pretty close to reciting poetry.
Yeah, yeah. But it's different.
Yeah. It's different.

Oh, so we can add things now?
Yeah, why not, right?

Amy: Okay, fine.

And you should know I'm not a pushover.
And I'm not a stone-cold bitch.
I'm a natural, beautiful presence.
Okay, I'm sorry these characters look like you, but that's where the resemblance stops.
Sure, june bug is a meanie to the platy-pups, but she's a sweetheart to the socktopus.
And cricket is a pushover when it comes to magic moose wishes, but she's very brave in the dolphin wars.
I guess what I'm saying is, these stories are nonsense.
I love you guys, but if you're bringing something more to my book, that's on you.

Well, Detective Rosa Diaz has left.
Hmm.
[Groans]
The only food left in the whole room is your stupid herring.
Oh, so we're talking now?
Well, I guess so, since words came out of my mouth and you heard them.
That's glib. No being glib.
It's on the list.
I'm so sick of the list.
I don't even know what ""glib"" means.
Ask yourself this.
Is it something you can hear Garfield saying?
If so, it's glib.
So what, you want me to just be Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle?
Think about what you're saying.
He's spineless and bland.
And by the way, me keeping things light and being ""Garfeldian"" is the only reason we don't fight.
[Laughs]
Wrong, baby.
The only reason we don't fight is because I never say anything when you annoy me, which is constantly, baby.
I just let it roll off.
I'm a duck's back, baby.
Stop saying ""baby.""
Charles Boyle calls people ""baby"" when he gets angry.
That's who I am.
And all this is who I am.
And if you don't like this stuff, then we shouldn't be friends.
Great. 'Cause guess what?
We're not friends.
That's fine with me, baby.

Uh-oh.

Well, the operation is blown.

Hitchcock: Well, well, well.
Looks like Boyle's out and Hitchcock's in.
What do you want to do tonight?
Go to a strip club?
Have dinner with my wife?
Are those separate options, or does she live at the strip club?
You want to know, you got to go.
Okay.
Peralta, thanks to your basketball mishap, the drop site has been abandoned, and Alexei Bisko's gone to ground.
We told you eight days was too long for a stakeout.
With all due respect, sir, it wasn't the amount of time.
It's who I was stuck there with.
I could easily have done it with Scully.
Really?
You would've applied that cream to his back?
No, I would've put it on the floor and let him roll around in it.
This isn't my first rodeo.
You need to find Bisko.
You can start by doing door duty, see if anyone knows where he is.
Take Boyle.
Sir, I'd like to request a new partner.
I can't work with Charles.
We're not friends anymore.
""Friends?""
I don't care if you're friends.
This is not a playdate.
This is your commanding officer ordering you to do your job.
Fine, but I hope you can live with the fact that you're forcing people to spend time together who would rather not.
I'm fine with that.
Sarge, I need to talk to you about the kid's book.
Seriously?
I'm wrapping it right now, and I need to focus.
Look, I know the story is nonsense and I'm not a forest nymph who wears armor pantsuits, but I think it bothered me because sometimes I can be too much of a pushover.
To be honest, it felt nice to stand up for myself this week.
Good for you, Santiago.
I also learned a valuable lesson from your stupid book.
I learned I'm perfect the way I am, and I should never change.
This is a symbolic gesture.
I'm speaking to you as a friend, not a Captain.
And as your friend, I have this brassiere you left behind in Marcus' room.
Also, I just wanted you to know, um, I think Marcus is great, and...
And you're great, and I hope the fact that you and I work together won't prevent you from dating if that's what you want to do.
I might.
But I don't want to talk to you about it.
Perfect, because I'm not comfortable knowing about it.
Great, then let's never talk about it.
Let's never talk about anything.
Done.
This is Bisko's aunt's apartment.
Maybe she's seen something.
Let's just get this over with.
Yes?

Interesting.
Very, very interesting.
Guys.
Captain Holt has no pants on.
Um...
What?
He has no pants on, is what.
Here are the facts: At 11:55 A.M., Captain Holt walked past us holding a hot bowl of soup.
At 12:03 P.M., I heard him yell...
Ouch!
Jake: Then at 12:07, he called Gina into his office.
She entered, holding nothing.
One minute later, she left holding an opaque bag.
Captain Holt's pants were in that bag.
His knees are in the breeze.
He's in his undies.
That evidence is circumstantial.
Oh, so you guys want visual confirmation?
No.
Not really.
Done.
Hey, Captain.
I just need you to sign something at my desk real quick.
Just leave it on the couch.
Dismissed.
Okay.
Sir, you're gonna freak.
Yo-Yo Ma is in the precinct, and he's giving out autographs.
Yo-Yo Ma is on tour in Australia right now.
How would you know that?
Sir, I'm choking on a lozenge!
I'm gonna die!
I got you, Jake!
No, no.
Stop. I swallowed it.
I swallowed it. It's fine.
Hey, hey.
I made you another bowl of soup since you spilled yours earlier, but you're gonna have to come over here to get it.
All right, Peralta, I'm sick of you wasting time, so, yes, I spilled some minestrone on my pants, and I'm sitting in my underwear.
Happy?
Yes.
Ah.
Sir, I need you to sign off on... look at us, just three people with pants on having a normal conversation.
Yep. No story here.

You should really thank my ex-wife.
We split it in the divorce.
I get it for December through February.

As always, there will be no spouses, no bosses, no work...
No bedtimes, within reason.
All right, Santiago's feeling rowdy.
Who else is feeling it?
I can't wait.
This weekend, I am Vacation Terry.
No kids, no responsibilities.
I'm just a balloon floating in the great blue sky, and I am untethered.
And just to clarify, how untethered is Vacation Terry from his wife?
Very tethered.
All right, anyone else have questions?

It's the pinnacle of the Santiago drunkenness scale.
One drink, Amy's a little spacey.
Wait. What?

Four-drink Amy is a bit of a pervert.
Hey, check it out.
Gina: And five-drink Amy is weirdly confident.
Let's do this, little man.
But I've never seen six-drink Amy.
Maybe she's the one I could actually be friends with, aka my sasquatch.
Hey, there, beautiful.
Marcus, what are you doing here?
I know you lost your phone charger, so I got you a new one, and I want to make sure your phone's all juiced up for some sweet long-distance texting.
Thanks. What do I owe you?

You said... you said not to say it.
Peralta, I thought you already left.
Yeah, I closed a couple of cases and had to finish up the paperwork.
Also, I wanted to thank you again for giving us this half day.
Yes, of course.
I understand how important these extravaganzas are.
I'm sure you'll have a hoot.
Oh, yeah, although I'm sure our hoots pale in comparison to the hoots that you had back in the day.
I bet things got supes hoots.
Actually, I wasn't privy to those events.
As a gay black detective, I was excluded from most social gatherings.
You guys off to play some golf?
Yeah. You want to caddy?
No, I do not.
Yeah.
Golf sucks.
I know that wasn't the point of your story.
Those guys were jerks.
Yes.
But I do envy the camaraderie they shared.
I've always wanted to Josh around with my peers.
So you've never joshed around with anyone?
Never.
But go have fun with the squad.
Really Josh around for me.
Welcome to château boy-Al.
Eleanor told me to keep the place clean, but I don't care.

Okay, well, Captain, the only free bedroom is my ex-wife's, which is strictly off-limits.
She locks the door and takes the handle home with her.
All right, you can have my bed.
Charles, I'll take yours.
Problem solved.
I'll sleep on the floor.
Charles: Captain, come with me.
What the hell, Jake?
No bosses.
Look, he told me this story about how his squad always excluded him, and I know I come across as a cynical, badass cop with a checkered past and a thirst for...

You would've too.
Guys, he just wants to josh around.
Is that so bad?
I am dating his nephew.
Now we're hanging out on weekends?
What is next?
[Shudders] Small talk.
Okay, Amy, you got to be glad that Holt's here, right?
I mean, you're basically in love with him.
I love him.
I'm not in love with him, but I'm definitely not comfortable being drunk around him.
Ames, please keep the volume down, okay?
[Whispers] Sorry. It's two drinks.
I can't help it. That's it.
I'm cutting myself off.
So Jake messes up, and you punish me for it?
Come on, Amy. You're better than that.
Jake: You guys, this is gonna be fine.
I mean, Terry's our boss, and he comes with us every year.
Correction: You bring Vacation Terry, and he is no man's boss.
When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled.
We're happy the captain's here.
Thank you, Scully and Hitchcock, the voice of reason.
Holt's the big fish we've been waiting for.
We have an exciting investment opportunity to pitch him.
What?
It's an offshore casino that's currently sunk off the coast of Delaware.
No, all right, you guys are both officially uninvited from this whole weekend.
Too late. We drove up as a group.
There's no getting rid of us.
Ah.
Rosa: Sorry, Jake.
This weekend's gonna suck.
Jake: All right, you know what?
You guys are being a bunch of racist, homophobic golf cops, and I for one think this weekend's gonna be even more fun because Holt is here.
Hey, what are you doing down here?
Lunch is ready.
I'm texting Marcus.
Mm.
Texting... that's the most intimate thing you can do to a lover with your fingers... other than washing their hair.
So I texted Marcus, and he hasn't texted me back.
I can't believe I'm asking this, but can you help me?
Oh, Rosa, yes.
I am the perfect person for this job.
Okay, let's get busy.
What was his initial text?
""I can't believe I miss you this much after three hours, X.O.""
X.O.? Girl, marry him.
What'd you write back?
""Ha-ha, lame.""
It's a joke. I was insulting him.
You know, flirting.
Think he's mad?
I bet he's heartbroken.
No, no. We can fix this.
We just have to write a very sweet, very heartfelt text that will jump-start the conversation.
""Hey, baby.""
I don't call people ""baby.""
You do now.
So how do you all typically blow off steam?
Does anyone have any formal complaints about the work environment?
No, no, we usually just gossip, right?
Amy, Charles, and Jake: Yeah.
Hey, did everyone see Dave from downstairs this week?
He shaved his beard.
Oh, my God.
His whole face looks like a butt.
[All laughing]
Ha-ha, Butt Face Dave.
Butt Face Dave, that's his new name, butt face Dave, 'cause his face looks like a butt.
[Laughter]
I like David. He's a good cop.
Yeah.
David is great.
He's a good dude.
I like that guy.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Good idea. Great idea.
Mm!
Amy, you don't have a drink?
Oh, no, it's okay. I don't...
The captain's making a toast.
Don't be rude, Prude.
Okay, I guess I'll have one more.
You're on vacation. Who's counting?
[Whispers] I am.



Holt: Thank you for inviting me up.
To joshing around together.
Cheers.
To joshing!
All: Joshing.
Gina: This is fun.
Ooh, you know what we could do after lunch?
Walk on the beach.
But it's the middle of winter.
Which is ideal, you know?
Not too hot, no crowds.
The sand doesn't get everywhere 'cause it's basically frozen.
Exactly. Who brought their beach boots?
[Raspy] ""I did.""
Spot-on Rosa impression.
[Wind howling]
Holt: This is nice.
I mean, the wind is unexpected but welcome and bracing.
Yeah.
It's like a thousand little needles of happiness shooting into your face.
Well, we've been walking for about 20 minutes, so...
So we should probably turn around in another 20.
Good plan... an 80-minute walk on the beach.
Mm.
I'm so cold.
Even my fiery dance moves aren't keeping me warm.
The trick is, you got to be prepared.
Mini cognac, ladies?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, warm me up, you little b*st*rd.
Mm.
Four drinks.
Mm, mm, mm.
Thank you, Terry's fanny.
And thank you, Poseidon, great God of the sea!
What are you wearing?
A T-shirt.
I only brought a bikini.
Seems weird to be in front of the captain in a bathing suit.
Got to cover up them thangs, yeah?
Fyi: You can still see them through your shirt.
So here we all are, finally relaxing as a squad together in the tub.
It's fun, huh?
Holt: I can't hear anyone.
Can we please turn off the jets?
Yeah.
Holt: That's better.
No more disturbed water.
Jake: Good call.
Wow, without the bubbles, you can really see everything.
Eyes up here, Peralta.
And... snip.
Mazel tov.
Captain, I bet you used to smoke cigars on the job all the time, right?
No, but I had a partner who did.
Had one burning all day long.
Dan Hammer.
That name is so cool, it doesn't need a nickname.
Ah, but he had one.
Snake Eyes.
Oh, Snake Eyes is a great one.
Oh, yeah.
He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever met.
When he died, he stuck out his middle finger so he'd be flipping everyone off at his funeral.
Oh, that rules.
Yeah.
Who killed him?
Don't say a white tiger on cocaine, 'cause I will lose it.
No, cancer of the mouth, tongue, lip, and cheek.
Hmm.
Well, still, the middle finger thing is cool.
Actually, no one got to see that.
It was closed casket because the doctors had removed so much of his face.
All right, that's that.
All right, I admit it.
It's weird having the captain here.
It straight up sucks.
Rosa: Should we just go home?
What do you think, Terry?
I am not going anywhere.
I'm playing kwazy kupcakes.
I'm hydrated as hell, and I'm listening to Sheryl Crow.
I've got my own party going on.
Jake: Wait a minute.
Vacation Terry, you're a genius.
We'll have two parties, a fun one down here with just us and then an awkward, uncomfortable one in the living room with Holt.
He doesn't even have to know about it.
Separate parties, separate but equal... forget I said that phrase.
Ok, we don't have much time. Captain's in the bathroom, and we all know how efficient he is in there.
Here's the plan: The boring Holt party will be in the living room.
At least three of us must be with him in that room at all times.
It's not a party if there aren't four people.
Especially between the sheets.
Jake: The other party will be in here.
Shifts at each party will be 20 minutes and staggered.
Any questions?
How do you get your hair like that?
Born this way... also, Hitchcock and Scully are not to be left alone with the captain.
They'll annoy him into leaving his party with their weird sunken casino idea.
It's not an idea. It's a scheme.
Okay, that is way worse.
I think this is gonna work.
And who knows?
Maybe the Holt party will even be fun.

Wow, I can't believe I almost made Terry do this.
Apology accepted.
I was so eager to make up for all the joshing around I'd missed, I forgot this getaway is really for you detectives.
And one of the things you're striving to get away from is your captain.
Yeah, I mean, it's nothing against you as a person.
Everyone loves you, but you're our captain, and normally we get really drunk and act like crazy idiots and play stupid games where we make fun of the boss.

This stupid machine won't take my dollar.
That's half a dollar taped to a pizza coupon.
It's good for a cheesy bread worth $2.50.
You would've made money on this deal, machine.
Hey, sarge, can I borrow a dollar?
No. No more loans.
You already owe me way too much.
The bank of Terry is closed.
What, are you sailing away on a tugboat?
Man, I love tugboats.
It's not a tugboat!
I'm locking the vault!
All right, fine, how much could I possibly owe you?
50, 60 bucks?
$2,437.
Dollars?
Wait, of course dollars, why was that the part I was surprised by?
Jake, I would appreciate it if you paid me back.
Well, that's the craziest thing anyone's ever said to me.
""I would appreciate it if you paid me back""?
Good. So you heard it too.
I've been in debt to him forever and he's never cared before.
Something's up.
I'm gonna drop everything and figure out why he's acting weird.
Or you could just pay him what you owe.
[Laughs]
Hilarious, Rosa.
[Continues laughing]
Hilarious.
Santiago, whenever you can, please drop of those case files.
You got it, partner! Be right in!
""Partner""?
What is going on?
Is this a make-a-wish thing?
Are you dying?
Is it from loneliness?
I found a mistake in one of the Captain's old cases and he asked me to work it with him.
As partners.
We're taking our relationship to the next level.
From awkward underling to awkward colleague.
This is a real ugly duckling story.
We're gonna bounce ideas off each other, eat street meat while we stake-out some perp, bond over burned coffee...
Santiago! Hm?
Now means now!
You got it.
See? He can't wait to work with me.
He's clearly pumped.
Hello, Terry.
I just thought I'd stop by and let you know that I'm on my way to the bank.
That's right.
I'm gonna pay you back because I know your secret.
What are you talking about?
I don't have a secret.
Oh, really?
Fact the first: After years of not caring about my debt, you weirdly want me to pay you back now.
That implies to me that there is a sudden, unexpected expense.
Or I got sick of waiting for you to do the right thing.
Not plausible.
You have endless patience for my shenanigans.
Fact the second: You've had dentist appointments twice in the past two weeks.
No one goes to the dentist that much.
I haven't been in seven years.
You should go to the dentist, Jake.
Probably. My teeth hurt all the time.
Fact the third: I'm really liking this ""fact the"" thing.
I think I'm gonna stick with it.
Fact the fourth: I found this on your desk.
It's a list of names.
Nathaniel Jeffords, Alexa Jeffords...
Those are my cousins names.
Lies!
There is but one conclusion.
You, Terry Jeffords, are pregnant.
The names are baby names.
The dentist? An obstetrician.
And the money is for baby things.
Like diapers.
What are you talking about, man?
Yeah.
That is crazy. Yeah.
Damn it!
Does anybody else know?
No, just you, and your wife, and crash.
That's what I think you should name the baby.
Works for a boy or a girl.
Listen up, Jake.
We just found out Sharon is pregnant and it's way too early to tell anyone.
This is a secret.
Do you understand me?
Yeah.
Do you?
Do you understand me?
Oh, this got physical very quickly.
This is adult stuff, Jake.
Be serious!
Look, I promise I won't tell anyone, all right?
My lips are sealed.
Good.
Do I even weigh anything to you?
No.
It's like holding a couple of grapes.
Okay, partner, let's bang this out.
Should we grab a cup of coffee, bounce some theories off each other...
I solved it already.
Oh...
Then should we grab a cup of coffee, you could tell me what you found out and...
No, we can do it here.
The fires were set by Richard Wilcox, the firefighter who was first on the scene at all three fires.
Okay uh, now we just have to work backwards, figure out why...
He was up for a promotion and wanted to look like a hero.
Yup.
But how are we gonna find this b*st*rd?
After all these years, you know, it could take...
He owns a store.
I have the address.
Okay.
I could drive.
No, you don't know where we're going.
But if you'd like a cup of coffee, there's an old bakery in that neighborhood.
The coffee there is terrible but I would enjoy the nostalgia.
I love terrible coffee.
Now let's put away Richard Wilcox, that no-good punk.
He's 86 years old.
You don't outgrow punk, sir.
There you are, sergeant.
Installment one of TBD.
1,200 bucks, that's everything I have.
You should also note it's all in singles because it takes so many bills to fill up a briefcase.
Thanks, Peralta.
You know, it's nice to finally have someone to share this secret with.
I'm pregnant, man!
Yeah! We're pregnant.
""We"" because I convinced you not to get a vasectomy.
So if it wasn't for me, you'd have no pen1s.
You still don't know what a vasectomy is.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking, now that I've proven I'm fiscally responsible, how you feel about me being the godfather?
How about this?
You don't tell anyone about the pregnancy for four weeks, and I'll think about you being the godfather.
Yes!
Oh also, I put a list of baby names in there.
My favorite: Nakatomi.
After the tower in Die Hard.
Works for a boy or a girl.
What's going on?
How'd you get all that money?
Pfft, by putting bad guys behind bars.
I work for a living, jeez.
I emptied out my checking account.
Wait, you've owed Terry for years, and now, suddenly, you give him every penny you have?
Why?
Why?
Oh, wait. Because.
That is not an answer.
No. Well, because you guys got in my head about owing Terry money.
And it convinced me that it's important to pay back your friends.
Well, you owe all of us money.
So does that mean you're gonna pay all of us back?
Yeah, Jake, or is there something special about your friendship with Terry?
Nope.
Nothing special about Terry.
I'm gonna pay everyone.
Man, I really hoped to say this to a drug dealer who killed my whole family, but...
It's payback time.
All right, but a nice little dent into my Terry debt.
No applause?
Seriously?
Okay, I see how this is gonna be.
All right, how much do I owe the rest of you?
$4,009.
What? How is that even possible?
June 3rd, 2008, paid for your lunch, $8.45.
June 3rd, 2008, bought you a soda, $1.05.
June 3rd, 2008, lent you $4,000 for an entertainment system.
Now there it is.
I stopped keeping track after that.
Sure. Sure, okay.
How about the rest of you?
710 dollarinos.
$856.32 okay, very specific.
I'm sorry you guys, but I can't pay that.
It's too much money.
Why don't you just take back the money you gave to Terry and split it six ways.
Then at least everyone gets something.
Yeah, but Terry needs the money.
For what?
Uh, for butt enhancement surgery.
Smart.
That's a real problem area for Terry.
Jake: Yeah. What?
Jake: What?
I am not having butt enhancement surgery.
Nor do I need it!
Okay, so split up the money.
No, no, no. How about this?
I'll work off my debt to each of you.
How's that sound? I'll do anything you want.
Anything?
Am I the only one that was super creeped out by that?
No, that was definitely creepy.
Yeah, he wants you to do something real weird.
Hello, partner!
Two coffees.
Black for me. Milk for you.
You remembered how I like it!
Yes, with milk.
It's just one ingredient.
And you remembered it.
Mm.
Anyway, no sign of Wilcox.
Maybe we should talk about deets of the case, plan our next move, grab a little chow.
No need.
I brought these.
Nutrition bricks. Hm?
I have original no-flavor and whole wheat no-flavor.
Nutrition bricks sound great.
Or we could grab a little street meat.
Kind of a classic stakeout food, but whatever.
Huh.
Meat.
From the street.
Sounds like a fun treat.
[Chuckles]
I'm a poet and didn't even know I was rhyming those words.
But it happened anyway.
That's a great idea, partner.
Let's grab some street meat.
Okay!
How's working your debt off going?
Horrible.
Rosa's making clean her motorcycle.
Payback's a bitch.
Ugh! So many great payback lines wasted on this.
Damn this bike's muddy.
And this isn't even the worst thing I had to do.
Gina made me call people and tell them she was dead to see how they'd react.
Is she crying? Is she crying?
A little.
You should be wailing, you stone cold bitch.
Now call my other grandma.
And then there was Scully.
Lower.
Lower.
I'm at your butt. Lower!
Apparently he holds his stress in the b-cheeks.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Well, at least I can help you out.
No, no, no, no.
That'll only make people suspicious.
Besides, I don't mind doing all these horrible things, 'cause I want to keep your secret safe.
For you, and Sharon, and Miata.
Works for a boy or a girl.
Well, well, well, what are you hens clucking about?
What? Nothing.
What do you want, Boyle?
To be paid back.
I want you to wash my dogs.
Hm, why would I ask that given that I know you hate my dogs?
They hump everything.
They're passionate!
But you don't have to wash them at all if you just tell me what's going on here.
You two have a secret.
I can smell it.
Jason, not now.
Down.
Yuck. We don't have a secret, all right?
Do we have a secret, Terry?
If we did, it's a secret from me.
[Laughter]
Okay then, wash my dogs.
And be warned, they just watched Peabody and Sherman, so they're extra horny.

So who was your partner back when you caught the Brooklyn broiler?
Martin Ormankupp.
He was a great partner.
Smart, loyal, homophobic but not racist.
In those days, that was pretty good.
Hm. How long did you work the case for?
Martin Ormankupp and I tracked him for eight months.
Almost cost him his marriage to his wife, Heather Ormankupp.
Oh, sir, look!
Oh, this could be our man. Let's go.
NYPD. We're partners.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
You're not Richard Wilcox!
That's my grandpa. He died a couple weeks ago.
I'm just here cleaning out his shop.
Oh, no. Something wrong here.
Oh, you think this punk is lying, partner?
No.
Something's wrong in my intestine.
Due to the street meat.
We must go now.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
All right, I'll drive!
[Police sirens blaring]
Holt: Oh, my...
Sir, we could find a public bathroom.
No! This is a very private emergency!
Holt: Ah!
I'm going to the gym, then Sharon is gonna take me to a dentist appointment.
Damn sarge, your teeth are messed up.
Listen up, everybody.
I just forwarded you an email about the suspect in those bodega robberies.
Check it out. We're gonna catch this guy.
All right, let's see here.
Hurricane?
Hurricane Jeffords.
Works for a boy or a girl.
Boyle: I know what's going on Jake.
Uh, what?
About who?
With you and Terry.
The money, the private convos.
I figured it out.
You stole my idea to open a bowling alley and you're gonna do it with Terry.
Yup, that's it.
Jake. Fingerholes was our idea.
I do not think it should be called fingerholes.
You're not calling it fingerholes?
Good luck, pal.
Oh, my God!
Terry's pregnant?
What? How do you know that?
We all know.
You hit ""reply all"" on the email, grandma Peralta.
Oh, no.
Uh, good. Great.
The secret is out.
I got humped by Jason for nothing.
Jake: Okay, yes. Terry is having another kid.
We are pregnant.
But that's a secret.
It's way too soon to tell anyone.
I only stumbled across it 'cause I'm such an amazing Detective.
Who accidentally hit ""reply all"" like some idiot on a brunch thread.
Yeah, that.
But, look, Terry can't know the secret is out.
He got the email too, boo.
Crap, you're right.
All right, we just have to break into his email account and delete the message while he's down at the gym.
Great, all right, here's the plan.
I'll go down there...
What are you gonna do, Jake?
I'm obviously about to say.
Okay? I'll go down there...
Sorry, Jake, I thought it was a call and response.
It's not. Okay?
I'll go down there... Are you mad at me?
Dude! Okay?
Here's the plan.
I'll go down to the gym and have Terry take me through his workout.
You guys get savant from I.T. to help you hack into his account.
If anything goes wrong, Scully, fake a heart attack.
What are you thinking?
Classic angina, or something sexier, like um, myocardial infarction?
Just drop down onto the ground and wiggle.
I'm gonna nail this.
You're back so soon.
Did you catch your guy?
No, he was dead. So I'll never catch him.
Also, Amy bought us tainted meat and now I have diarrhea.
Oof.

Hey, Terry.
You get my email?
About how I was coming down here?
No, I haven't checked my phone.
Oh, no need.
I just wanted to make sure you were here, you know?
You know how I like to have a weight-mate.
Really?
I have never seen you in the gym.
What?
I basically live here.
I'm a regular gym dandy.
Besides, I gotta get into shape for all the godfathering I'm gonna do.
I mean, how am I gonna throw our baby up into the air with these noodle arms?
Good point.
So take me through your workout, man.
Rip me up, you know?
Let's rip it out.
Time to rip it down!
Those aren't gym terms.
And I don't think you could handle my workout.
Oh, wow.
Sounds like a challenge to me.
Come on.

I got you.
Ready? Yup.
Oh, my God! So heavy!
This will crack his password, but it could take an hour.
No way Jake keeps up with Terry for that long.
Have you seen Terry?
Well there's nothing we can do.
Unless you can guess the sarge's password.
""Big muscles""? Nope.
That's your first guess? ""Big muscles""?

Nope. Sharon1.
Nope. Sharon2.
Nope. Sharon3.
Nope. This is stupid.
Come on! Push it!
Push it!
Five!
Ah! Oh, man.
This is almost too easy.
Are you crying?
No. That's eyeball sweat.
All right. Let's wrap this up.
I gotta call Sharon and get back to work.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, I thought you said this was gonna be a challenge, huh?
This has been a cakewalk so far.
Oh, you want me to make this harder?
Yes.
That is what I want.
More harder exercise.
Look, sarge!
I've burnt 200 calories.
That's your heart rate.
Yeah. That checks out.
Come on, Jack, ten more minutes.
I think we should stop now, Peralta.
No, no. I'm still good.
Check this out.
Right hook, right hook, uppercut.
My arms don't seem to be responding to my brain anymore.
Nope.

Come on, Jake! Let's go!
So how much blood do you usually have in your mouth when you do this?
None.
Great, I'm done.
Great workout, sarge.
Ah, Boyle, I need to throw away this piece of paper but I can't move my body.
On it, Jakey.
It's show time, here we go.
I love this, we're like Batman and Alfred.
You'd rather be Alfred than Robin?
He has access to the batcave, plus, he gets to drive all of Batman's girlfriends home and dish.

Okay, yes, that was one fact that may have helped them crack the case, but Boyle was closing in.
I was actually way off.
All my theories were bowling alley related.
Fading, fading again.

But it was an honest mistake.
I promise you, I was taking it seriously.
What was the email you sent everyone about?

I said wheel him out.

Not what I was expecting you to say.
Of all the cases that we worked, that moment was the one that bonded us the most.

I sold my car.
It's not a big deal.
Oh, my God! This is such a huge deal!

Wait, seriously?
Yes! Of course!
That would be amazing.
Thank you.
I'm gonna be such a good godfather.
You'll see. I'm gonna be like...

Jake: Like courtroom PTSD.
Incompetent!
Idiot!
Mint?
I could have choked on that mint Even the nice ones are psychopaths.
All right. Let's get fired up.
Pound on my shoulders. That's my stuff.
Wait! Wait! No, don't hurt me!
Ah, that was a bad idea. I'll bang my own sulders.
Let's go.
Holt: Detective, have a seat.
I am grappling with a highly vexing conundrum.
What to do about Deputy Chief Wuntch?
Precisely.
I could torpedo her promotion.
Just saying it brims my soul with joy.
But to do so would mean would mean that she stays here in New York City hanging over me like an albino bat.
On the other hand, if I ""praise"" Wuntch, she will leave this city, the clouds will part, and the children will sing ""Wuntch is gone.""
What children?
All the children. Right. That was a stupid question.
What was Sarge's advice?
Oh, you and I both know what Mother Jeffords would say.
""Take the high road."" But I asked you, Detective Diaz, because you understand vengeance.
Yes, I do.
I had a nemesis once: Carla Bianchi. Mm.
She wronged me, and I crushed her like a gnat between my fingers.
I got her suspended from the second grade.
Second grade? That little turd hoarded all the good markers.
But eventually, she came back to school.
And she made the next ten years of my life miserable.
It's not worth it.
Be nice to Wuntch.
""Be nice to Wuntch?""
You may go now, Mother Diaz.
I hate this. Everyone is looking at us.
Only because we're equally massive, beautiful men in tuxes.
Yeah. Sophia.
Heeeeeeey, girlfriend.
That came out saucier than I was expecting.
Yeah. Hey, Jake, What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed to press pause.
We did. I'm not here to see you.
I'm here to see your boss, Geoffrey Hoytsman.
We're gonna bond. Oh, God.
Oh, good indeed. You misheard me on purpose.
Possibly. Look, I'm gonna charm him.
He's going to start giving you the good cases again.
This is gonna work. No, it's not.
How can I explain this? Oh, Okay.
Imagine this room is full of super-intelligent robots...
Oh. Hell-bent on ending humanity, and you are a working-class human who just entered their swarm-hive.
Okay, love this, love you, keep going.
Oh, that's a really weird moment to say you love me for the first time.
Oh no. Was it?
I'm just gonna blow past that. Yeah.
Look, the point is, you can't charm robots.
So you should go before they pod you and harvest your brain.
Look, I've done my research on Hoytsman: Skiing, nature, Atlantic City, I'm ready for him.
Sophia. Sergeant Jeffords.
Detective Peralta.
Please, my friends call me Jakey Snowpants, because I'm skiing so much. [chuckles]
Carving moguls on a black diamond.
I prefer cross-country skiing.
It's not a sport if gravity does the work for you.
Yeah. Gravity sucks.
Not the movie, the theory. Anyway, I've been spending most of my weekends in Atlantic City these days.
Oh, that place is a dump. No.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to steal Sophia away.
You can't charm the robots.
What in the frig was that?
He's always in Atlantic City.
Why would he go someplace he hates so much?
Unless there was something there he loves.
I bet he loves gambling.
Just like I'm here in this dump because of Sophia, who I now love.
You're really going hard on this love thing.
Well, I said it out loud. It's on the record.
I can't take it back Just get on board, Terry.
Hello, Gina. Ah!
What are you creeps doing?
You made me look away from my phone.
You better pray I didn't miss a text.
In your two seconds you looked away?
17 texts. All of them important.
Amy suggested we negotiate terms, so if you agree to give my dad his blessing, here's what I'll do for you.
""You will never see me in my pajamas on a family trip. We will never share a bunk bed. And I won't force you to participate in our annual themed Christmas cards.""
This year my dad was Mary and I was the baby Jesus.
Yeah, I know. Got one. Lived the nightmare.
Well, the list goes on. I signed it.
Amy notarized it. I'm a notary.
No big deal. I met the comptroller.
Okay, you know what?
This isn't about out lives getting intertwined, okay?
I'm actually worried about my mom 'cause she's been hurt before.
This is all moving way too fast.
Wow. Gina.
That's really sweet.
And the only reason I didn't tell you guys is 'cause I don't value you as people, so it's, like, why be honest?
Yeah, you just went back and ruined what you said.
Right. Mm-hmm.
Look, I know I'm a stage five player, just mowing down chicks left and right, but my dad's not like that.
He would never hurt your mom.
Just talk to him, you'll see.
Fine. I'll talk to him.
Just to ask him some questions.
But go get him before I change my mind.
Okay. Okay.
Oh. I already changed my mind.
Aww. All right, I'm back.
Oh. Oh. I'm back.
Geoffrey: After that, the judge just threw it out on the spot.
[all laughing]
That judge has a deep voice, right?
I'm gonna go, uh, check out the food.



Hey.
Bet you five buck you can't guess three of the hors d'oeuvres they're serving.
I'll take that action.
Chicken satay, tuna tartare, shot glasses of gazpacho.
Satay, tartare... no 'szpach.
Where the 'szpach, Hoytsman?
Yes! 'Szpach!
No! Well played.
Unless you want to go double or nothing.
I'm listening.
Jake: Oh, nothing but glass!
I'll bet you can't tell how tall the Sarge is.
In eggrolls.
24. Exactly 25 eggrolls tall.
Celebration eggroll.
Hey, man, that was on the floor.
You're on the floor.
60 bucks says you can't remove one glass without knocking the whole thing over.
You didn't say I couldn't grab the top one.
[glass shattering]
Yes!
100 bucks says I can jump from the roof and survive.
Oh, I don't think you can...
[chuckles] Just messing with you, Peralta.
I gotta hit the head. Oh, then we'll bet on who can shove more shrimp in his mouth.
You're on. I got a big mouth though.
You're in trouble.
I thought you were leaving.
Were you just talking to Hoytsman?
Talking. Bonding. Betting.
Oh, I should bet him that I can pee for longer than he can.
Ugh. The trick is to pinch it.
All right. I'll be right back.
Oh. Gotta fill up the tank.
Ah! Hello Geoffrey.
Hello.
And that's cocaine.
This night is making me incredibly anxious.
Oh hey, Stay close.
Someone messed with the champagne tower.
You're all I've got.
Jake is stupid, but he's smart.
I think his plan is actually working.
Oh God. Hey, so, No big deal, but I arrested your boss, and I never should have come here.
Well I read that wrong.
Oh, this is insane. This is so insane.
I wasn't doing anything.
He was snorting cocaine in the bathroom.
Okay, for the last time, that is not what happened.
And that's cocaine.
Are you sure? [chuckles]
Five dollars says you're wrong.
Let me get in there. Take a good look and smell.
No, don't. [groans]
Okay. It was cocaine.
Turns out I was accidentally doing some cocaine.
Not on accident.
You put it in your nose on purpose.
I don't even think I have a nose, Peralta.
I certainly cannot feel it.
The defense rests!
Shh. Keep your voices down.
What is going on here?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Sophia's cop boyfriend is arresting me in front of my friends and colleagues.
Hey, everyone. I'm Jake.
So who here saw 12 Years A Slave?
Best picture.
Holt: Well, Diaz, the deed is done.
You torpedoed her promotion?
Sadly, no.
I gave that goblin a good recommendation.
Your story about the marketer really hit me.
I began to realize that if even you thought I should take the high road, that was probably the right choice.
I'm sorry you didn't get your vengeance.
Mother Holt. Good one.
But I am still planning to get some retribution.
I got her a parting gift.
Tickets to Wicked?
In Boston.
She's moving to a second-class city, and I wanted to rub her nose in it.
Enjoy the understudies, Madeline.
Have fun watching some chubby Chenoweth knock-off warble her way through Popular.
Hello, Lynn.
Hi, Regina.
Don't play games with me, boy.
This is a bad idea.
No, it's okay. Dad's got this.
He's a real sweet talker.
Let's cut the crap.
Okay. What are your intentions with my mother?
To make love to her every morning until we die.
So it's just physical?
What are you nuts?
I'm a divorced, retired florist with a terrible gluten allergy.
Your mom is a beautiful, brilliant travel agent.
She talks to people on the phone who've seen the whole world.
I'll never meet anyone half as good as her.
She's the best thing that ever happened to me.
You mean other than Charles?
No.
She's the best thing that ever happened to me.
That's okay, Pop.
You did what you had to do.
I love her.
All I want is to make her happy forever.
Fine. I give you my blessing.
But if you hurt my mom in any way, so help me God, I will cut off your son's testicles.
Snip, snip, snip. And I'm not playing.
Deal.
[chuckles]
Way to go, Dad!
You bagged a babe. [gasps]
The Boyle boys are planning a wedding!
Boyle boys! Boyle boys!
Both: Boyle boys! Boyle boys!
Both: [laughing]
You screwed this up, buddy.
You thinks she's gonna still love you after this?
She'll see who you are now.
Hey, you don't know anything about me and Sophia.
What? I'm talking to myself about my wife.
She is not gonna like this.
Who cares about you and your gross life?
Jake, heads up.
Oh, hey, Sophia. Thank God you're here.
I was just gonna find you so we could talk.
Jake, I'm not here to talk to you.
I'm here as Geoffrey's attorney.
Oh, I can do it myself. Watch this.
Objection, objection, objection, objection, objection!
Five! Five objections.
Maybe this ""cocaine"" isn't so bad after all.
Okay. Geoffrey, I'm gonna have to advise you to stop talking/confessing in front of the detectives.
Okay, look, I know that you're mad, but I talked to the D.A. and he agreed to drop the charges.
Geoffrey just had to do a little bit of community service, and nothing will even go on his record.
Not good enough. You have no evidence.
Sophia, there's cocaine on his collar right now.
Oh, not anymore. [inhales]
Whoo!
You're really not reading the vibe right at all.
Tell you what, that's the cocaine.
I'm usually very tuned in.
Shh. I had to arrest him.
I had no choice. Really?
'Cause I could think of 50 other ways you could've handled this scenario.
Oh my God, you are such a lawyer.
You are such a cop.
I tell you I need some space to figure things out and you come kicking down the door with the first plan that pops into your head.
How is it my fault that your jerk boss put his jerk nose into a pile of jerk cocaine?
You followed him into a bathroom at a party you weren't even invited to.
Hey, you know what? We're done.
All right, fine. I'll talk to the D.A.
I'll see if I can cut the community service in half, how's that? No, Jake. Not with the case.
You and I are done.
[Jake panting]
Jake, what are you doing?
I wanted to stop you.
Grand gesture. I took the stairs.
A little winded there, buddy? Yeah.
Romance is hard!
Can you just talk for, like, 20 minutes while I catch my breath?
I don't have anything to say.
Oh come on.
This is just a stupid fight about nothing.
I'm not gonna let us break up over this.
Jake, our jobs are incompatible.
Our lives are incompatible.
Look, we'll just never talk about work, or interact with each other's friends, or acknowledge each other in public, and I know this sounds like I'm describing enemies, but we can make this work.
We're Romeo and Juliet.
It didn't work for Romeo and Juliet.
That play ends in a tragic double suicide.
That's how it ends?
Why do people like it so much?
All right, look. Jake, you're fun, okay?
And we've only been dating for three months.
It's just not that serious.
Well, it's kinda serious to me.
I've accidentally said, ""I love you,"" like, four times already.
I know. I-
I just don't think I accidentally love you back.
Look, it's just... it's just so much work.
That's work I'm willing to do.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Double suicide?
Holt: Hello, Madeline.
Raymond. I was just about to call you.
I wanted to thank you for your kind recommendation.
And I wanted to give you this.
Wicked.
Starring Beth Danube.
Well played, Raymond.
Sadly, I won't be able to use them.
Since I'm not going to Boston. What?
I was only interested in the Boston offer as leverage.
I used it to get a promotion from the NYPD.
I have never had more power over you than I do at this very moment.
I wanted to give you these as a thank you.
You're joking.
I'm gonna call the commissioner.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I know you never would have recommended me for that Boston post if deep down you didn't think I deserved the job.
What the...
A thank you round of drinks and a toast to Amy. Oh.
Your conflict resolution skills has made my childhood dreams come true.
I'm gonna be a ring bearer.
You don't think your dad will make you best man?
Oh, I just assumed he'd ask Jake.
Mm. Move over, please. I do have a wedding to plan.
'Cause if this thing is happening, it's not going to be a Boyle brothers event.
For starters, all the bridesmaids are gonna be dressed like Roseanne from the television show, Roseanne.
Oh, I like that show.
A certified shaman will conduct the ceremony, and the ring bearer will be an actual wolf.
Oh man, I could do it, but I wouldn't be as majestic on all fours.
This wedding sounds weird. I'm into it.
To Lynn and Darlene Boyle.
All: Cheers.
Yuck.
My lady left me.
My lady stayed.
Come on, sir.
Focus on the good.
You can hold your head up: you took the high road with Wuntch.
Not entirely.
When I was alone in her office, I changed her auto-correct.
Now when she types ""Wuntch,"" it gets replaced with ""Butt.""
Ah, I should not have gone to that party.
I shouldn't have gone to that bathroom.
I should not have arrested her boss.
I don't see it that way.
You did everything right. You were a good cop.
Good lonely cop.
Hey, man, you put yourself out there.
You weren't breezy.
You like Sophia, you fought for her.
You should be proud.
No, you should be changing her auto-correct.
What's her last name?
Perez. No.
It's ""Butt"" now.
Sophia Butt.
That's feels good, doesn't it?
Not really.
Okay.
Then let's get soused.
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Mine. Mine.

Whatcha got there?
A candle, perfume. Bra.
Someone's dropping off a care-package for mom.
Ew. No.
It's the stuff that Sophia left at my apartment.
Oh, bud. Oh, bud.
Breakups are the worst.
Man, I just want to walk up to Sophia, slap her in the face and say, ""Girl, you messed up.""
Terry: You need to destroy that stuff.
You want me to crush that big box into a little ball with my bare hands?
No.
I'm gonna text Sophia and give her her stuff back.
That way I'll get to see her again and hopefully smell the air around her hair.
That'll make me feel better. No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, you need to embrace the pain so you can get through it.
You need catharsis.
Sarge is right. You need to cathart.
Cathart your brains out.
Cathart all over the place.
That is a great point, guys.
Thank you.
You know who'd appreciate that a lot is Sophia, I'm gonna text her.
I'm gonna take that phone now, Jake.
I'd like to see you try.
Well, you did that very easily.
Look, I understand that you're trying to help, but I promise you, the best thing for me right now is to text Sophia.
Give me my phone?
Okay. Thank you.
And... send.
Why hasn't she written back yet?
Uh, this feels terrible.
You two could have stopped this, but you didn't, you monsters.
♪ ♪
Charles: Hey.
Any idea what this emergency meeting is about?
Probably about how all the cell towers in the city are broken, and that's why Sophia hasn't texted me back.
I keep checking my phone every three seconds, like a loser.
Tread lightly, son.
Jacob...
Have you done any of the catharting exercises I gave you?
Well, I don't own a bathtub, so the first two pages are out.
And it's the middle of winter, so where would I dance in a fountain?
Indoor malls, Jake. Indoor malls.
All right, squad.
Evry year, the Department of Homeland Security runs a multi-agency counter-terrorism drill.
The team from the DOD had to drop out at the last minute.
Thanks to our stellar scores at last year's tactical village...
Nine-nine!
They want us to fill in.
We are the only non-federal agency ever invited to this event.
This is a huge opportunity and we are going to nail it!
Nine-nine!
All: Yeah!
Charles? Yeah?
You know what I'm thinking?
Yes, we should pack grapes for the road.
No.
This drill couldn't have come at a better time.
I'm gonna throw myself into it and focus solely on getting a win, and not whether or not Sophia's texted me back.
Which she hasn't, in case anyone was wondering.
Nine-nine!
All: Yeah! Nine-nine!
I don't get it.
Santiago, Diaz.
Before you go, both of you requested to have this Saturday off, but I need one of you to work.
Oh, I could take that shift.
Well, last time you worked a Saturday, you watched cartoons the entire time.
Well, that's when they're on.
Work this out and get back to me.
Sorry. I can't reschedule.
I have tickets to a TED Talk on power poses and getting what you want by using your body.
Uh-oh.
I hope it doesn't get too sexual.
""Uh-oh, I hope it doesn't get too sexual.""
Title of your s*x tape.
But seriously, what is taking so long?
Also the title of your s*x tape.
Well, I have plans on Saturday too.
I'm having dinner with my parents.
So?
You don't even like your parents.
You call them smiley morons and hug freaks.
Plans are plans, I'm a badass, not an anarchist.
I don't buy it.
You know, if you told me what you were really doing, I'd consider changing my plans.
But you didn't so I'm getting Saturday off.
Are you trying to power pose me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm supposed to be sitting in a chair.
This is why I need to see the talk!
Captain, is the entire squad at this dumb field trip?
Yes, they are.
Is there a problem?
Uh, yeah.
You know how I've been defying all expectations by going back to school?
I always knew you had it in you.
Can't you just be blown away by me?
I need someone to take this personality test for my Psych class.
I was hoping to wow my professor with a genuine psycho like Amy, or Hitchcock, or Charles would be great.
I'm not a psycho, but I could take your test.
That would be awesome.
I do need to warn you that the results can be... a little unflattering.
It's okay, I'm no stranger to unflattering test results.
Your blood pressure's normal.
Normal? Take it again.
I'm not afraid to have my flaws exposed.
But just to be clear, though, it is possible to get a result that shows no flaws?
I guess. Good.
Good. Can't wait to begin.
Sophia text you?
No, it's just a lightly racist email forward from my Grandma.
But it doesn't matter.
It's time to cathart. Check it out.
Windbreaker city.
ATF, Marshals, ICE, FBI, Homeland Security.
Welcome to the big leagues, Boyle.
Oh, say that again.
I want to record it and use it as my ringtone.
Eh.
Hey, there.
Jake Peralta, NYPD. Pleasure to meet a colleague.
Colleague? Dude, read the jacket.
Homeland. We're not on the same level.
Wow. That was incredibly rude.
No, no, no, no.
I've always admired people who decided what they wanted to be when they were six years old and never waivered.
Bus drivers, ice cream men.
Princesses.
So when exactly did you decide you wanted to be a butt?
Was it college? Law school.
Just wanted to let you know that I went to law school.
At Butt University?
What are you doing?
I'm standing up for us.
Don't worry about it, that guy doesn't matter.
All right. Everybody, take their seats.
My name is Agent Kendrick, Homeland Security.
And I am in charge here.
Sarge, I was wrong. He totally matters.
This year's scenario.
Terrorists have stormed the Capital Trust bank building and have taken hostages.
Noice!
Oh, cool trick.
I don't have a ton of free time to practice high-fiving.
You just made fun of us for that.
For practicing, that's the first time we ever tried it.
Here are your assignments.
ATF, you will be our terrorists.
Ooh, that's a rough draw.
Homeland Security, you are Command Control.
Marshals, Strike Team Alpha.
And NYPD?
Helicopter snipers, helicopter snipers.
Says here you will be our hostages.
What?
So you just want us to lie on the ground and do nothing, like a bunch of losers?
Yes, precisely.
No. Jackpot.
Can you leave me some wiggle room so I can check my phone periodically?
Why? Waiting for your mom to text?
No, actually, I'm waiting for a girl who broke up with me to text.
That's way worse. Yeah, it's bad.
This sucks.
I just got dumped by a mega-fox and no one's letting me shoot a big gun about it.
All right, you know what? Screw this.
I'm not gonna just sit here like a loser.
Boyle, free me, then I'll free you.
We're fighting back.
No, Jake.
We are behaving so we can be invited again next year.
Sarge, with all due respect, I am going to completely ignore everything you just said.
Okay, Charles.
Our hands are tied so we're gonna have to use our mouth.
Smart.
Wet the tape down with my saliva until you could slip right out.
No, bite it. Obviously, bite it.
I don't like it. Something stinks.
Well, I'm sorry.
But I refuse to mask my natural musk with a bunch of chemicals.
Uh, I was talking to Rosa about her ""dinner"" with her ""parents.""
I am having dinner with my parents.
Okay, liar.
What restaurant are you going to?
I don't know, some ltalian place.
Oh, Italian? Makes sense, Pinocchio.
He's a liar too, and ltalian.
I over explained it.
Gina: Okay, last question.
What body of water do you most identify with?
A, lake, B, river, C, ocean.
Oh, they can't be serious. Of course I choose ocean.
I hate the ocean.
That's where that stuck-up bitch Rose let Leo die.
There was plenty of room on that door.
Okay, the computer is tabulating.
Ohh.
You got category I9 C3 G6.
I9 C3 G6. Is that as good as it sounds?
You have a robust sense of self and are well suited to leadership positions.
Characteristics... strength, determination, tenacity.
Yes, I suppose that's accurate.
They do call me Tenacious Ray down at the country club.
Because for the past 10 years, I've been suing them for discrimination.
I'm very pleased with this assessment.
You should be.
I took the test too and I also got an I9 C3 G6.
What?
We got the same score?
It's just crazy how accurate this thing is.
Yes. Crazy.
All right, Sarge. Now to cut you loose.
No, I'm staying tied up.
I don't care how much of a jerk Kendrick is.
I want it to be clear I had no part in this.
No offense, but you are a huge waste of muscles.
Okay, Boyle.
There's two guards outside this door.
We need their guns. You know what to do.
Beat 'em up?
Pretend to be sick and lure them in here.
Right. The Charles.
Here we go.
Help!
I need help. I'm sick.
Is this part of the drill? What's wrong?
I have Seasonal Affective Disorder.
What?
It's a serious condition that affects millions of Americans.
What the hell?
We're fighting back, you terrorist crap sack.
Also, thank you for including us in this event.
Jake: You got a partner outside, right?
Call him in here.
I need help!
[gun shot]
Ow.
Shh. You're dead.
See you later, losers.
Again, opportunity of a lifetime.
Just a real positive experience.
All right, we need to distract them.
Do you have anything I can throw?
I have a dog tag.
Oh, that is bad ass, Boyle.
No... it's an actual tag for a dog.
Yep. Molly.
She was my poodle growing up.
Never forget your first.
Your first what?
Dog.
That is never what people mean by that.
When you get to hell, say hi to Molly.
What? Why is Molly in hell?
Cause it sounds cooler than heaven.



Hiyah!
Both: Aah!
Door kick. What's up, dude?
Is it lunch time? Is the drill over?
We're freeing you guys.
Jake, can you hear me? Is it lunch time?
No, it's not lunch time. It's 10:30 in the morning.
No wonder I was starving.
Look, we came here to win and they're not even giving us a chance.
I think it's fair to say that no one in the history of America has been discriminated against more.
Buddy. Yeah, that's my B. Adrenaline talking.
So you guys in? I don't know.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Oh, wow. You sound like a real Terry.
Why don't you just take your shirt off and make your pecs bounce around?
Again, the adrenaline. Don't sue me.
Look, you two are still arguing about who gets Saturday off, right?
Highest body count wins. Done.
I'm gonna vape you like my e-cig.
Okay, you basically just lost.
Nine-nine, we are hostages no longer.
You know, I really meant to rip off the whole thing, but I say we go with it!
Come with me, hos!
2-1, Diaz.
4-2, Santiago.
Jake, this is great.
I shot a guy in the face. He is so mad at me.
Nice.
All right, this hallway is clear.
I think we killed them all.
It's a regular paint bath.
Like bubble bath. No, like blood bath.
All right, meet in the basement. Here we go!
Hyah!
Okay, me and Boyle took down six.
Rosa and Amy got 14.
Hitchcock and Scully?
Were killed immediately.
Yeah, we're dead.
We also disarmed and captured all these guys, so is that all the terrorists?
Not quite.
Drop your weapons, everybody.
Drop them right now. It's over.
You lost.
Drop them now or...
You're dead, crap sack.
All right, Sarge!
You decided to be cool.
I'm always cool.
I also couldn't spend another second listening to those ATF wads bitch and moan.
Leave it to the NYPD to screw up being hostages.
I thought cops loved to sit around on their fat asses all day and do nothing.
That's it.
Whoa!
My ass is not fat!
Kinda sounds like it was just about your weight issues.
I'm not gonna lie, that did strike a chord.
But I also didn't like the stuff they were saying about us.
Look, I'm proud to be a cop.
This drill is over. Let's get the hell outta here.
Drinks on me! Nine-nine!
All: Yeah! Oh, my God, it worked.
Let's go.
And nothing from Sophia.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Um, we're not quite finished yet.
I know I, for one, am not done kicking bootay.
Dude, there's no more terrorists.
No, but there's more catharting to do.
We can make everyone regret ever taping us to chairs in the first place.
Sarge?
It seems unnecessary to piss everyone off.
I heard one of the Marshals call you jiggly Jeffords.
What? Give me another clip.
Now we're talking. You two are tied, right?
Both: Yeah.
Settle that score. Jake, what do you say?
Want to go after the Marshals?
And this butt from Homeland?
Get yourself a real win?
I don't know, Boyle. I mean, they're the good guys.
And that would make us... the bad guys.
Noice.
So you're in? Oh, I'm in.
I'm in all the way to hell.
And when I get there, I'm gonna see your dog, Molly.
Let's go, squad.
That was really unnecessary.
Terry: Jake, come outside. I've got Kendrick here.
Peralta, what are you doing?
You're NYPD, you're supposed to be hostages.
Supposed to be.
But we rose up and took down the terrorists.
That's right. We're the bad guys now.
Is this some sort of game to you?
Does this sound like a game?
I am a terrorist leader. My name is Francis Gruber.
My brother, Hans, died at Nakatomi Tower at the hands of John McClane.
Also, I'm related to Jeremy Irons from the third one.
Okay, so it is a game.
Well, I'm not playing. Drill's over.
Drill's over, boys. Yeah, that sounds right.
We're not on the same level.
And apparently, you're at the level that can't handle us.
You trying to goad me, Peralta?
'Cause I'm in charge here and I don't have to engage with mall cops.
But I will.
Say it, don't spray it.
I'm in. What are your demands?
A guarantee that this drill doesn't end until one of us is dead.
Also, one large pizza with fennel sausage.
Brick oven, otherwise it's sog city.
And Scully needs some Gas-o-nex.
Extra strength.
Scully: Chewable!
Okay, so a fight to the death, pizza and Gas-o-nex.
Scully: Chewable!
You have 30 minutes to meet our demands.
After that, we paint ball a hostage every 15 minutes.
Got yourself a deal, Gruber.
Get us those demands. We'll be waiting.
We're not waiting one second.
Those demands were a ruse.
They were? I really need that Gas-o-nex.
I think there was some dairy in the cheesecake that I ate for breakfast.
We're not gonna hang around like sitting ducks.
We're gonna take the fight to them.
Like some waddling ducks!
If the waddling was super fast and cool.
Like some boss-ass penguins.
Yes!
I'm so glad you're back on our side, Sarge.
Okay, let's destroy some good guys.
Gina, I was outside on business and I purchased a box of assorted sweet treats.
I give you the first pick.
Don't mind if I do.
Curious.
On your personality test, you said your favorite shape was a square.
And yet now, when you're given a choice between round cookies and square blondies, you opt for the cookie.
You opt for the circle.
Yes, but it's not about shapes.
I'm choosing a cookie over a Blondie.
I'm whimsical, but I'm not a lunatic.
For butter, eggs, flour, sugar, baking soda, chocolate, salt, vanilla.
The basic building blocks are identical.
The only salient difference... their shape.
You're trying to get me bumped out of I9 C3 G6.
You don't like that the test put us in the same category.
That is so rude.
Do you know how many basic bitches would kill to have the same personality as me?
Gina, you know I appreciate you but you have to admit, we're not exactly cut from the same cloth.
Apparently not.
I, of course, am an exotic silk, whereas you, sir, are snake skin.
So you can keep your box of deception and leave me alone.
It's a box of shapes and it contains only... the truth.
Fennel sausage. Jake, they did it!
Balcony's over there.
How many are out there?
Six Marshals. We're pinned down.
Great, it's over and we're still tied, 8-8.
What the hell?
9-8. Saturday's mine.
You said body count, you didn't say whose body.
Boom!
Power pose.
Ahh!
They got me. I'm dead too.
Kendrick? Come out!
It's just you and me.
Okay, okay. I'm outta ammo.
Be cool.
Well, well, well. Hello, agent.
You don't actually have to shoot me.
We can just say that you won.
But I want to shoot you.
No way this is brick oven.
They were playing us, Jake!
Right, you're having a moment.
So. Any last words?
Just don't shoot me in the face.
I got a date tonight. I don't want it to puff up.
I'm already 10 pounds heavier than the picture she saw.
Okay.
Just to clarify, those are your last words?
Because I'm about to shoot you.
Ow! What?
No! [chuckles]
Gun taped to the back.
All these Die Hard references gave me the idea.
I got John McClane-d.
That is so much worse than any paint ball.
Interesting tactic, detectives.
Show up at your first inter-agency drill and mess the whole thing up.
Less of a tactic and more of a series of incredible events.
And what was the most incredible event... when I shot you in front of all your friends?
I have other friends. Who?
I knew it was a dumb idea to invite the NYPD to a federal drill.
Seriously, man?
You took all our guns, taped us to a bunch of chairs, called us fat, and we still took almost all of you out.
Next year, we're winning this thing.
Oh, you're not coming next year.
But maybe I'll see you at the Pentagon Christmas party.
Oh, right.
You guys aren't invited to those.
Kid Rock was there. Those are my last words, bro.
Man. He is just a really bad dude.
Jake, I'm sorry you didn't get your win.
Are you kidding?
This was a total win.
I haven't checked my phone in forever.
Now that I've said that, I do kinda want to check it, though.
I'm gonna just do it.
No text.
But I'm probably 20 percent less devastated than I would have been this morning.
And that's thanks to you guys.
[gasps] I catharted.
You catharted hard.
Gina, I've been thinking long and hard about what happened yesterday.
Oh, pray tell.
But remember, I'm not at your level so do speak down to me.
I owe you an apology.
The test was wrong to classify us both as I9 C3 G6's.
That's a terrible apology from content to tone.
I meant I don't deserve to be an I9 C3 G6.
I should be an I9 C3 G4 or an I8 C5 G3, or even an I7 C7 G8 or I2 C1 G3.
Is this a Rain Man impression?
No.
Those are all personality types not well-suited to leadership.
Just as I have not been.
A good leader should never diminish those around him.
It was devastating. Gina.
You're tenacious, you're strong.
You're a great leader.
And most importantly, any basic bitch would be lucky to be like you.
Apology accepted.
Can I have a huge raise? No.
But I am expanding your responsibilities to match your great promise.
You are now in charge of all scheduling decisions and budget tracking.
No! You can do it, trust me.
From one I9 C3 G6 to another.
It's crazy how much he flirts with me.
Hey, so I told Captain Holt I'd work on Saturday.
Wait, why? You won fair and square.
I mean, I murdered you.
That was pretty shady.
Also, it was crazy assertive and I feel like maybe I don't actually need power pose training.
You don't.
Mostly because nobody needs power pose training.
The dinner with my parents on Saturday is to introduce them to Marcus.
What?
Why didn't you just tell me?
I didn't know stuff was getting that serious.
Yeah. It's very embarrassing having feelings.
Anyway, thank you. You're welcome.
Rosa's in love!
[whispering] Power pose.
Dropping this off for Sophia Perez.
Oh, no, you don't have to call her.
I'll just leave it here with you.
Okay. Jake?
Hey. Hi, uh.
Sorry I didn't text you back.
Thanks for bringing my things.
Well, I need to move on and having this stuff around makes that difficult, so.
Including this multi-surface cleaner?
Well, I only bought that to impress you.
And it worked, so...
All right, well, I should probably... get back to arresting bad guys.
Yeah, I should, uh, get back to proving they're not so bad.
Jake and Sophia. Enemies for life.
Like McClane and Gruber.
Both: You're the Gruber.
You're the Gruber.
I'll see you in court, Jake.
Okay. Bye.
Tell me if she turns back for one last look.
She turning?
Did she turn? Did she turn?

02x16 - The Wednesday Incident
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=21122,"





All right, here's where we stand.
This nightclub is the home base for the Maric crime syndicate.
I've been tracking the club owner, Vladimir Drogic, aka The Dragon, aka my first perp with a cool nickname.
What about El Baboso, The Dagger?
Yeah, turns out Rosa was lying about that.
El Baboso actually means ""the slug.""
Ha ha, tonto. That means ""dumb-dumb.""
Jake: It was very cruel.
I referred to myself as El Baboso to several beautiful Latina ladies.
Oh, that's your type, isn't it, Jakey?
Like Sophia and Sa... [stammers]
Anyway, The Dragon is involved in several counts of human trafficking as well as...
I'm sorry, what's going on? Who are you?
Drexel with the Organized Crime unit.
I'm here for the Maric case materials.
Oh, are you?
Well, we'll see what my captain has to say about this.
Thank you for taking the materials.
Make sure you also pick up the files that are on Peralta's desk.
Wow, that is not how I saw it playing out.
Sir, I thought you said this was my case.
I gave you two weeks.
I'm done fending off the Organized Crime unit.
Squad, since Peralta's briefing was cut short, you can all use this time to clean up your desks.
Look at this place: half-eaten food, crumpled tissues, pictures of your families.
What's wrong with pictures?
If you love someone, you'll remember what they look like.
What is this?
Rubber band ball.
Keep your bands in a box or a bag.
Since you all apparently have time to play throw, I'm canceling overtime for the month, effective immediately.
Get to work! And de-ball these bands.
[upbeat music]
Brooklyn Nine-Nine - 02x16 The Wednesday What is going on?
Holt's been in a bad mood all week.
Did somebody do something to set him off?
Jake, are you seriously asking why Captain Holt is mad?
What do you mean?
The Wednesday incident.
Hey, hey, just closed my tenth felony of the month, and I thought we could celebrate.
Might I remind you that this is a police precinct and it's 10:00 in the morning?
Thought you might say that.
That's why this is nonalcoholic sparkling cider.
There's absolutely nothing you could be mad about.
[cork pops and knocks]
Uh-oh.
No, no, no, look, I was the first one in on Wednesday.
This story's already full of holes.
He was in a bad mood before those sprinklers went off.
Something must have happened at home.
Dude, just admit that you ruined everything and you turned our lives into a living hell.
No biggie.
You guys, this is not my fault.
Boyle, you believe me, right?
Don't make me do this, Jake.
Betrayed!
All right, you know what? Fine.
I'm gonna prove to all of you that something else is responsible for his bad mood.
It's probably Boyle.
Don't worry about it. Don't open it.
No personal calls.
What the hell? That was Marcus.
He's gonna think I hung up on him.
Leave him wanting more.
That's basic seduction stuff, Diaz.
Captain Holt has been in a bad mood, and I'm not letting it get any worse on my watch.
I need overtime back.
Ladies and gentlemen, six banks robbed in three weeks, $250,000 stolen, citizens trembling in fear.
Well, no more.
Boyle, you got your bank robber.
Went home last night... no overtime.
Just me and some brie, and I cracked it.
So here he is, the thug that's been terrorizing the city.
Say hello, Marvin.
Hello.
Oh, my God, he's so old.
He's not that old. His nurse isn't even full-time.
He couldn't pull off a bank job.
He couldn't pull off the cap on his medicine.
I can hear you.
Sorry.
Hey, this guy is a ruthless criminal.
I'm sorry, sir. Is this gonna take long?
'Cause I was hoping to buy some slacks this afternoon.
I like corduroy. You like corduroy?
I love corduroy.
He likes corduroy.
You sure you have the right guy? Wasn't the robber strong and fast?
And able to eat solid foods?
Nobody saw him eat.
The guy wore a rubber mask, and his voice was disguised.
My system is a little unsettled.
Could I trouble you for a ginger ale?
Oh, of course, sir.
We'll get that and a comfy chair for you to sit in.
Yeah.
I robbed those banks.
I don't even need the money, but I like to see the tellers squirm.
I get off on violence.
Oh, my God.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you so much.
You're such a doll. I must pay you.
No, no, no, I insist. I insist.
Right here.
You remind me of my granddaughter.
Oh, you are so sweet.
I haven't got a granddaughter.
[groans]
What are you doing here?
You're not scheduled to work today, and overtime is canceled.
Yeah, well, remember about a week ago when I came in here with a bottle of sparkling cider?
Setting off my sprinklers, drenching my office, destroying a paper crane folded for me by Kevin.
Right, I forgot how that ended.
The point is, that was all just regular cop stuff.
There's no way that can be the reason you've been in such a bad mood.
Bad mood... I'm sorry, haven't I been bursting into song enough for you lately?
Would you like me to click my heels together or skip like a schoolchild?
Yes to all of that.
But for reals, what non-me thing is bothering you?
Is there trouble at home?
Peralta, I'm not gonna discuss my home life with you.
We're not friends. We're not family.
You're not my husband.
Oh, that's hurtful.
I thought we had a special bond.
I was your secret Santa last year.
And I already thanked you for the ""Who Farted?"" baseball cap.
But you never wear it.
So Holt won't tell me if something happened at home because I'm not his husband.
But you know who is his husband?
His husband.
His husband.
I was just a little slow.
Yeah, Kevin's not gonna talk to you 'cause he can't stand detectives.
Yes, but he can stand yous.
Nuh-uh, I spent a lot of time cultivating a good relationship with Kevin.
He finally calls me Gina instead of Ms. Linetti.
All right, fine. Then I'm calling in my chit.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
No, ch-it.
What?
Remember when I got you this job?
You said, ""OMG, Jake. I owe you one.""
I said ""OMG""?
That was before other people started saying it.
I was an originator.
You said I could ask for anything, and for six years, I've been sitting on that chit.
Well, now I'm cashing it in.
A receipt for almonds?
Yeah, I just thought it would be more dramatic to slide something across the table.
It wasn't, but since I made that promise, fine.
[knock at door]
Hey, Kevin. Gina, good to see you.
Jake's here too.
Yo.
Gina, I know you like champagne with a drop of pomegranate juice.
I like to say it's nature's classiest alcohol mixed with its narst-iest fruit.
And, Peralta, I hope this will do.
It's a can of orange soda from when some other children visited.
It's perfect. Thank you for inviting us in.
Yes, I invited Gina in. You were with her.
Okay.
Look, everyone's blaming me for the captain's horrible mood because of a small thing that happened Wednesday morning.
When you flooded his office with cider?
Well, the water actually flooded it.
The cider just caused it.
But I swear he was already upset when he got to work.
He was anger articulating.
Coat, coat, jacket, coat.
Is this a police precinct or a Turkish bazaar?
Mm, yes, I dread those annunciated denunciations.
Yeah, I hate those de-bunce-ebations...
But so my question is, could something have happened at home before he left for work?
Well, I remember that morning.
He left this house at 7:00 and was in a great mood.
In fact, he was still chuckling about the previous night's Charlie Rose.
Fine, so your marriage might not be the problem, but he didn't get to work until 10:00.
That means whatever ruined his mood happened in those three hours.
We have to retrace his steps.
We?
I'm not going to investigate my own husband.
Uh-huh, totally.
Well, that was a great chitchat.
Don't you think, Gina?
Seemed like it went real bad for you.
Chit-chat.
Oh.
You know, Kevin, maybe if we figure out what caused Raymond's bad mood, we could fix it.
Good idea, Gina.
I suppose we could look into it.
Yes, great! Let's go right now.
No time to lose. Don't look, just run.
You're trying to get me out of here before I see the orange soda you spilled on the chair, aren't you?
I'm already out the door. It worked!
What the hell?
Are you throwing a tea party for this monster?
He was sitting in processing, and he just looked so lonely.
This guy is guilty.
He confessed to me, but now he's pretending that he didn't.
You must have misheard me.
I didn't do anything, except being charmed by these two lovely ladies.
Oh, cut it with the sweet-old-coot routine.
You're going to jail, my friend, in a trolley named Charles.
A trolley?
Trolleys are cool.
They have the bells. You know what?
Just take your tea and leave my perp alone, please.
Thank you, ladies, for bringing a little sunshine into my gray life.
You want to know what I'm gonna do with the money I stole?
Hmm.
Prostitutes.
Huh!
Amy, you heard him. Tell me you heard him.
What?
Son of a bitch!
Well, this is where Raymond eats breakfast every morning.
Yes, I know. He's always raving about how they don't have specials.
Diane, hello, this is my friend Gina, and this is Detective Peralta.
They work with my Raymond.
Oh, Peralta, you are so old to behave the way you do.
Oof.
What?
I'm sure he vents about everyone on the squad.
Nope, just you.
Damn it, Diane, what are you doing after this?
So did anything unusual happen when Raymond was here last Wednesday?
Did he mention anything?
No, he had his regular breakfast: room-temperature water and one hard-boiled egg yolk.
Hmm, well, that is his good-mood food.
So, Peralta, we know he was fine through breakfast.
Looks like you're still on the hook.
No, there was still plenty of time before he got to work.
Gina, what'd he do next?
Well, according to his sched, his next stop was his weekly painting class.
Painting class?
Can I guess what he paints?
Pictures of pie charts.
Multiple still lifes of this gray rock.
That's even more boring.
So, Gerald, did anything happen to Raymond last week?
Did he seem like something or someone had him in a bad mood?
It was his day to pick the music, and he chose Haydn.
So he was in a good mood or a bad mood?
Gina: A great mood, Jake.
Oh, you're Jake.
Damn it.
What are you doing after this, Gerald?



What is wrong with our Internet?
I like to back up my data every 15 minutes, and it's taking 17 minutes per backup!
I'm in a data backup deficit.
We are in the same boat.
I've been trying to load this video all day.
You're watching videos during work?
I told him to do it, sir. It's case-related.
""Turtle humps computer mouse.""
Terry: Yeah, Turtle's the name of a local pervert we're chasing.
Come on, Hitchcock. Get it together.
So did anything strange happen when you and Raymond sparred last week?
No, as usual, Raymond was the king of the croisé, and I got in a few good raddoppios.
So just a bunch of normal words.
Are you sure we're talking about last Wednesday?
Positive. Haven't seen him since.
You haven't?
Mm-mm.
I'm sorry. I need to leave.
Excuse me.
Kevin. Kev.
What's going on?
Raymond has been lying to me.
Three mornings this week, he told me he was fencing with Dan.
Why would he do that? Why would he lie to me?
I don't know.
Maybe it's connected to his bad mood.
My husband does not lie to me.
This investigation of yours was a bad idea.
I'm going home.
I have to sort this out with Raymond.
Good-bye, Peralta. Linetti.
Linetti? No.
We were on a first-name basis.
Gina, this is bad.
Kevin's upset. Holt's gonna be angry.
We're both gonna get fired, and I'm gonna die alone.
Jake, why don't you just do the right thing and jump out a window?
Captain Holt will never fire me if he knows I'm mourning the death of a close friend.
Or we could try plan B and just fix it.
You never even tried plan A, though.
Hey, how'd it go with Kevin?
Are you willing to admit everything's your fault?
No, Amy, because none of this is my fault.
Except for how you meddled in the captain's life today, possibly causing repercussions in his marriage that could last a lifetime.
Yes, that is completely on me, but, Amy, you didn't know that, so you were still wrong.
Terry: You two need to go.
You're not supposed to be here, and the captain's at a new level of anger: constant smiling.
[forced chuckling]
It's horrible.
All smiling's horrible. This is worse.
We're here so I can activate the Holy Network of Administrative Assistants, acronym HNAA.
We high-level assistants keep track of what's going on with all the bosses.
Jealous, Amy?
Yeah, I'd tap that.
Network. I'd tap that network.
That's a thing people say.
Yeah? No.
I've answered all your questions, young man.
What more do you want from me?
I'd like you tell Santiago about the banks you robbed and how you get off on violence.
What? Boyle, oh, my God.
[knock on window]
What are you doing?
Why are you being so weird about this?
Marvin Miller is guilty, and he thinks he can get away with it.
He also thinks the subway should be horses.
He's old, is what I'm saying.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
He's messing with me because I'm not intimidating like Terry or dignified like Jake or model-handsome like Jake or funny like Jake.
Yeah, I might buy my shoes at a kids store, and, yeah, I might be scared of geese, but I am a damn good cop, and I will not be made a fool of.
So I'm gonna go into that room, and I'm gonna get that lousy old geezer to admit on camera that he robbed those banks.
He just died.
What?
[thud] [gasps]
Okay, here's what I learned.
The chief's assistant, Ryan, was only pretending to have Mono.
Okay, Gina, about Holt.
Fine.
Apparently he was supposed to meet Deputy Chief Ash near his fencing club at 9:30, but he canceled at the very last minute with no explanation.
HNAA does it again.
Okay, so something happened between fencing and coffee.
We just have to figure out what.
Totes, but first, let's check in with Ryan on how to fake mono, 'cause if I can nail that...
Ooh, game changer.
Okay, so Captain Holt leaves fencing and heads north.
If we really want to do this, we got to get in his head.
We have to be Captain Holt.
[in deeper voice] Hello, Gina.
How does this sound?
Captain Holt, is that you?
Oh, no, it's Jake nailing your voice exactly.
Right?
The trick is to find a key phrase you know exactly how he'd say.
Mine is, ""Peralta, that's enough.""
Seriously, Jake, this is getting scary.
[laughs]
Come with me, young, wise assistant.
Let us walk in this direction.
Oh, a hot dog. Would I stop?
[in British accent] Not for one of those, I wouldn't.
Damn it, it's morphing into British.
Do your catchphrase.
Peralta, that's enough!
And I'm walking with purpose. And I'm walking with purpose.
And bingo.
Gina: A door.
[gasps] It's a Narnia situation.
No, but I love that.
It's a security camera.
If something happened to Holt when he walked past here, we'll be able to see it.
[in deeper voice] Peralta, you genius.
Mm, that does not sound like him.
Okay, personal photos are down, kitchen is spotless, and I got the silver-painted break-dancer outside to move his very loud boom box elsewhere.
[electronic dance music playing]
♪ ♪
You beat him in a dance-off?
No, I destroyed him.
There's absolutely nothing here that will set off Holt.
Oh, oh!
I was trying to cook my oatmeal with a road flare, but it caught on fire.
Why are you using a road flare?
You said the kitchen was off-limits.
Scully: Yeah, this is your fault, Sarge.
Give me that.
I'm just holding a road flare, stepping on some oatmeal.
Just doing me.
I can't believe that you, of all people, are my biggest problem today, Jeffords.
Kevin, is the captain home?
No.
Good, I figured out what happened to him.
He was mugged.
What?
He told you this?
No, I used my detective skills as well as my spot-on Holt impression to figure it out.
I retraced his steps and found security footage.
After he left fencing, three shady guys followed him into an alley.
One of them had a knife.
That's why he's been in such a bad mood.
He's a police captain that got mugged.
He's embarrassed.
Oh, my goodness.
Holt: Peralta.
There he is.
What are you doing in my house?
Raymond, you were mugged?
What?
What did you say to him?
Captain, it's okay.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm not embarrassed, and I wasn't mugged.
Three men tried to mug me, but I fought them off, injuring two of them.
[all grunting]
Wait, so you heroically fought off three guys, and that put you in a bad mood?
If I did that, I would literally write a song about myself.
It would be like...
♪ Jake the hero ♪
♪ Abs of steel ♪
♪ Sha-la, la-la ♪
Why would you keep this from me, and why would you lie about going to fencing?
Because he couldn't go, because he's injured.
I wasn't injured. I was lightly stabbed.
I'm sorry. You were stabbed?
Lightly stabbed. I didn't want to frighten you.
You are my husband.
I want you to tell me everything, especially things that might frighten me.
How can you not know that?
Raymond, you are unbelievable.
Hey, Captain, you look so tall.
What you have done is beyond unprofessional.
You cannot muck around in people's private lives.
Get out of my house.
But get into your car? I'll go.
Sir.
Detective.
So how was your night? Of work.
I'm not asking about your personal life.
I don't care about you personally.
I mean, I'm neutral. I mean, who are you?
Floundering is worse than silence.
Oh, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool, cool, no doubt. No doubt, no doubt.
[clicks tongue]
Man, this elevator's slow, huh?
That's because you haven't pressed the button.
That's why you're the captain.
[chuckles]
So smart.
I'm gonna just... zip.
No more talk-y. Hmm.
[elevator dings]
Eek, blast of cold air coming out of that box.
Name of Amy's s*x tape.
Hey, man, come on. Not cool.
I'm going through something. Just let me have this one.
I'm sorry you wasted your chit, Jake.
It's all right.
I want to apologize to Hol but it seems personal, and I'm not supposed to talk to him about personal stuff.
Oh, boo, I guess you need to think of some professional way to make it up to him.
Wait a minute. Gina, that's it.
I just had an idea.
[as Holt] Peralta, you're a genius.
Who was that, ScarJo?
It was Holt, and I think you know that.
I thought it was ScarJo.
I can't believe that b*st*rd beat me.
Whoa, he's dead.
It's kind of hard to see how he's the winner in this.
He made me look like an idiot.
No, Amy and I were the idiots, because we let that ancient windbag fool us.
He robbed the banks.
He gave me money for the ginger ale.
After you insisted he was guilty, I went back and checked his dollar.
Serial numbers match the stolen bills.
Rosa: You brought in the right guy.
You're a damn good cop, Boyle.
I know. No one listens.
Except when you threw water in his dead face.
That was rough.
I thought he was faking it.
I wanted to splash the lies out of him.
All right, Detective, what's this all about?
You have 70 seconds.
Why 70?
Do you really want to waste your time while I explain my algorithm?
Right, all right, so I pulled a still from the security footage of your attempted mugging and sent it to the nearby precincts.
We ID'd one of the mopes, and that's his apartment.
I thought maybe you would want to do the honors.
And you think this will make everything you did better?
Well, maybe. It was Gina's idea, so...
It will.
Gina had nothing to do with it.
You want to know why I was so angry all week?
When those men came at me, I acted like I was a 20-year-old.
I took a stupid risk, and I got myself stabbed.
I was in pain and frustrated about lying to the man I love.
Kevin.
Yes.
Obviously Kevin.
Obviously.
What I'm trying to say is, you were right all along.
I wasn't mad at you.
I was mad at myself, and I took it out on the squad.
Peralta, you're a genius.
Oh, my God. You said it.
I heard you practicing in the men's room.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
Attention, squad, quick announcement.
Overtime is reinstated, and you are each allowed two personal photographs, two trinkets, and three assorted knickknacks.
You know what?
Just follow Sergeant Jeffords' lead.
He always knows how to keep this place running smoothly.
Nice, so rubber band balls are back.
Oh, no, it's bad for the bands.
Ah, Kevin. Let me just get my coat.
Hello, Peralta. Gina.
Oh, sweet lords of dance, thank you.
We're back on a first-name basis.
Kevin, I am unable and unwilling to discuss personal matters with you.
I'm aware of that, yes.
In any case, thank you for you help.
I brought you both gifts: original Raymond Holts.
[Gina gasps]
I will treasure this painting of a rock for all times.
Holt: Ah, Rock 59 and 367.
Those are good rocks.
367 paintings of one rock?
This guy parties!
man: Not a doctor. Shh.

02x17 - Boyle-Linetti Wedding
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=21123,"





Gregor Minsk, the counterfeiter I've been chasing for two years, has finally resurfaced.
And he's just as evil as ever.
Right. You hate him because he has a typo on his counterfeit bills.
No. Because he passed $4 million in fraudulent bills, Jake.
But also, two Rs in ""pluribus?""
I mean, did none of those cashiers take Latin?
Okay, let's give Amy a round of applause for whatever that was.
Police briefing. Still in progress.
And you did great.
But let's get serious, people.
Tomorrow is the wedding.
My mom is marrying, shudder, Charles' dad, toilet emoji.
We are gonna be brother and sister.
To think this started with us just going to town or each others sexy parts.
[all groaning]
Charles, promise me that is not in your toast.
It's not.
Come on, man.
Look, I need everything to be perfect.
Status update, Rosa.
How are the flowers?
I don't know.
Yellow. Terr-bear?
I had my tuxedo altered to make it tighter like you wanted.
Delicious.
Jake, have you checked in with the jeweler?
Yes. They said the ring will be ready at 2:00 on the wedding day.
I'm gonna pick it up on my way to the ceremony.
This is very important, Jake.
Are you sure you can handle it?
Uh, well, let's see.
Easy, last-minute, and crucial as hell.
Meets all the Peralta criteria.
Good. These tasks are top priority around here, people.
I don't care how many criminals go free.
All right? Dismissed.
Uh, I'm not done with my briefing yet.
I said dismissed!
♪ ♪
Guys, guess who I'm about to see.
The Bubes? Michael Buble?
Okay, you're the only one who calls him that.
And no. Jenny Gildenhorn.
The girl who dumped you at your bar mitzvah?
Yes. I can still see her slow-dancing with Eddie Fung.
[Air Supply's All Out of Love] ♪ I'm all out of love ♪
♪ I'm so lost without you ♪
I'll never forgive that bitch for what she did to you.
Well, you better forgive her because she's about to become, uh, my girlfriend.
Turns out Gina's mom is friends with Jenny Gildenhorn's mom, and Jenny is gonna be at the wedding.
That's right. I'm finally gonna get the slow-dance that Fung denied me.
Is she even single? Uh-huh.
For the first time since we were 13.
Eddie Fung was replaced by Colin Brandow, then Ethan Stokes, then Tanya Astor, don't tell her mother, then she met her husband, Matt Hench, who she divorced three months ago.
Probably because he's a major loser.
I mean, Assistant U.S. Attorney? Get a real job.
You really kept tabs on her, huh?
It's most of what I do here.
A-ee. A-ee. A-ee. A-ee.
What's happening? Is Charles having a stroke?
No, he's warning me you're here so I won't talk about other girls.
Just thought it might be weird for you, because of your history.
It's not weird at all. Yeah.
I told Amy I liked her, she told me she was deeply in love with me, and it's all in the past.
I did not say ""love"" or ""deeply.""
It's in the past, Amy. Move on!
Rosa, I had a question about Marcus and the wedding.
I'm not bringing Marcus.
You guys broke up, huh?
Mm, just hit it and quit it.
We are so similar.
We did not break up. I'm just not totally sold on the relationship yet, and I don't wanna bring him to some stupid wedding where he might get all romantic and say, ""I love you.""
I mean, what am I supposed to do then?
Say ""I love you"" back?
I've only said ""I love you"" to three people.
My mom, my dad, and my dying grandpa.
And one of those I regret.
Which one? Grandpa.
He beat cancer, so now I look like an idiot.
Wow, man.
Would either of you like a starring role in the wedding of the century?
I already told you, I'm not go-go dancing.
Well, someone's getting in that cage.
But more importantly, my mom's priest dropped out, so I need one of you two to step up.
[sighs] Who would be better equipped to deliver a heartfelt, emotional speech about love?
I have to imagine it's not me.
I could do it. I'm already ordained.
Mario, Karen, yesterday was chest and shoulders.
Today, and for the rest of your life, it's heart and soul.
Smart. You tailored the ceremony to the bride and groom's interests.
Yeah. Yeah. That's totally what I was doing.
I mean, working out is not the only thing I feel comfortable talking about.
Uh, what would you say is your mom's favorite move at the gym?
My mom likes champagne, baked ziti, the Bahamas.
Charles's dad probably lives under a bridge and uses a puddle as a mirror.
I don't know. You figure it out.
Okay.
I got the ring. Let's go.
Okay, thanks. Try to stay off heroin.
Your mom? No.
That was my informant. She spotted my counterfeiter four blocks from here. We have to go check it out.
Uh, but I wanted to get to the wedding early and reserve a seat so Jenny can sit on my right side.
I'm been practicing my crying and it turns out this is my juicier duct.
Please? I've been chasing this guy for two years.
What if it was your collar?
I would have caught him nine months ago in a shootout on top of a ferris wheel.
Minsk is my nemesis.
He's my Eddie Fung.
Fung.
All right, that I understand.
We'll check out your lead, then we'll go to the wedding.
Let's go find Eddie Fung.
Minsk. Right. Minsk.
Fung.
Oh, Regina, everything is so beautiful.
Well, as long as you're happy, I'm happy.
Charles: Rosa, ah, there you are.
Can you help my dad with his cuff links?
Sure. I would do it, but it's bad luck for a boy to see his father on his wedding day.
Oh, well, in that case, no.
Rosa, please. It's a slippery slope from uncuffed sleeves to Lynn just wearing an old turtleneck down the aisle.
Actually, my dad can really rock a turtleneck.
Gives him a sexy Elliott Gould vibe.
Charles, shut up.
Rosa, go find Lynn Boyle and cuff his ass.
There you go. Thanks. [chuckles]
You nervous? Oh, not at all.
I love Darlene Linetti with all my parts.
Wow. I can't ever imagine being with someone and not having any doubts.
I have little doubts.
Tiny little doubts.
You think that's a problem?
I mean, not if you're sure she's the one.
Yes. Of course.
But I was sure about my five other weddings, too.
[chuckles] Please, don't tell Charles.
He only... he only knows about three.
Back-to-back Catfish situations, you know?
Same kid both times actually. That's okay.
Just took you a while to get it right.
Yeah, or maybe I'm just doing the same thing over and over again. [chuckles]
Lynn Boyle rushes headlong into another mistake.
Like that time I tried water aerobics and I broke my neck.
This is a disaster.
All right, I'm gonna go get Charles.
I wonder what Jenny Gildenhorn will be wearing tonight.
Do you think she'll be in her high school field hockey uniform? That'd be crazy, right?
Yes, it'd be crazy if that's what she wears to a wedding.
Yeah, you're right.
Ah, well, I hate to say it, but there's no sign of Minsk.
We should really get going. Jenny awaits.
Oh, my God. Look!
Fung. Minsk!
Right, Minsk. I know it's Minsk.
Let's go!
Clear.
He's gotta be in here somewhere.
Clear.
I love this. Tux on, gun out.
I feel like James Bond and you're my mysterious femme fatale that I've been partnered with, Maxi Pads.
Maxi Pads? I don't know!
I didn't want to make the name too sexual and I panicked!
Clear. If we catch this guy in the next 15 minutes, we can still make the wedding.
So what's your opening line gonna be with Jenny Gildenhorn?
I was thinking I'd go with, ""Jamie Gordenhorn?""
You know, make it seem like I haven't been staring at her on the lnternet for the past 20 years.
Or you could call her by her real name.
Girls like that. I don't know.
I think girls like being deceived.
No? Okay.
Clear.
So, you're really okay with me and Jenny Gildenhorn, huh?
Totally.
Stuff with us is in the past.
We talked about that. I know.
But that was before you saw me in this dope-ass tux.
I mean, you must be freaking out.
Oh, I am. I'm really into rented clothes.
I love how many butts have been in them.
I know you're making fun of me, but that sexy voice is kinda getting me going.
But more importantly, this is a fancy outfit, all right?
I sprang for the three button jacket.
It was $8 extra.
He's heading for the alley.
Whoa, hey. Dad, it's your son under here.
Charles Boyle.
Rosa said you had a personal question.
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm just second-guessing every decision I ever made.
Oh, my God, why did I buy a cube-shaped car?
Because you love it. Dad, listen... Oh!
Let's just sit down... Oh!
Screw a 2,000-year-old tradition.
I'm taking the bag off.
[gasps] Okay, Dad, listen.
Everyone gets nervous. Everyone gets cold feet.
I was nervous before I married Eleanor.
She ended up cheating on you with the guy from the mattress commercials.
Sleepy Stu? Don't bring up Sleepy Stu.
Rosa thinks I should call off the wedding.
That is not what I said.
This is why I don't talk to people.
I just asked him if he was feeling nervous.
Rosa, you know how suggestible Boyle men are.
I saw one Samuel L. Jackson movie, and I wore a Kangol hat for three years.
Ah! There has been a mix-up and the caterer has cooked one of the doves, so I need some good news.
How is that speech going?
Do you want to hear it? Yes.
""Darlene and Lynn, I want you to remember the words of Luther Vandross: 'A thousand kisses from you... [voice cracking] 'A thousand kisses from you is never too much...'""
Every time he reads it, he breaks down.
I thought you had done this before.
Well, yeah, but that was just workout metaphors.
You told me to get gorgeous with it, and it took me to some very real places.
Terry, I'm sorry, but you're fired.
Captain, the speech is yours.
It needs to be emotional and poetic.
Can you do it?
Well, my first Captain used to call me Emily Dickinson.
Great.
Of course, he meant it as an insult about my sexuality, but don't worry.
I am good at emotion.



NYPD! We know you're here, Minsk!
Freeze!
Hey! [grunts]
Gregor Minsk, you're under arrest.
Oh!
I can't let Jenny see me like this.
I ripped my cummerbund.
It's okay. I have an extra one.
You can borrow it.
From my high school jazz band uniform.
I'm only gonna tell you this because you were a great partner today.
Uh-huh?
I played French horn.
I still do.
Oh, whaaaaaaaaat?
The guests are all here and nothing is ready.
We don't have a ring, the cake says, ""Darlene and Lunn,"" and the smoke machine is not working.
I could crouch by the altar and vape.
You are a stone-cold atrocity.
Okay, we just need to make sure nothing else goes wrong.
Charles... Hmm?
Where is your dad? Where is Lunn?
Um, he's still having a little trouble with his cuff links.
You know us Boyle men and our clumsy ham hands.
Please say you're not gonna reference your ham hands in your toast.
Well, you made me take out the brother-sister s*x stuff, so there was this big hole on page 18.
Page 18? Made it!
Made it in time. Ew, Amy!
Your dress is filthy.
Luckily I brought you a spare outfit. Hmm?
I knew I was gonna hate whatever you chose.
Oh, my God. It's Jenny.
She's here. Okay, how do I look?
You look great. Go get her, Bond.
Thanks, Maxi Pads.
Jenny Gildenhorn?
I didn't know you were coming to this.
Jake Peralta? Yeah.
Oh, my God. How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
Wow.
Oh, sorry I'm a little bit ruffled.
I arrested a very dangerous counterfeiter on my way here.
Ah, look at that.
One of my three jacket buttons is unbuttoned.
Must have happened during the fight.
That's embarrassing.
Hey, I don't know anyone here. Want to sit together?
Uh, yes, I would.
After you.
Uh, Jake, wait!
What are you doing? Give me the ring.
[chuckles] You sound like Gollum.
That means nothing to me. I don't see those movies.
I'm too pretty. Okay.
Well, not to worry.
I've got the ring right here.
Nope. Those are my mints.
I eat mints. No big deal.
Um... uh-huh...
I lost the ring.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I must have dropped the ring somewhere around here during the takedown.
I'm so stupid! No, it's my fault.
I made us go after Minsk.
Please don't climb in here.
I don't want you smelling like garbage for your slow-dance with Jenny Gildenhorn.
Oh, don't worry. The only thing I'm gonna smell like is the Jason Priestly cologne I wore in middle school.
It's just called ""Brandon,"" and it is overpowering.
[gasps] Jake! Look!
Oh, my God! You found it!
And you're on one knee.
Are you proposing? Yes.
Will you, Jacob Peralta, accept this ring and bring it with me to our weird friends' parents' wedding?
Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Oh!
[grunts] Tight.
Yeah, it's so tight, dawg.
And no, I mean the ring is actually tight.
[grunts] Amy, it's stuck.
The ring is stuck. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me try. We have to get this off.
Jenny's gonna think I'm married.
Also it'll ruin Lynn and Darlene's wedding.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just us here.
You don't have to pretend like you care about them.
Okay. Jake has the ring.
I found an extra place setting for your psychic.
Strange, she said you wouldn't be able to.
Because she's a fraud.
You need to start seeing my psychic.
Best of all, I fixed this!
Charles: It's working! How'd you do that?
I grew up with a smoke machine in the apartment, Charles.
I liked to enter the kitchen in the morning with vivacity.
Regina, you're amazing. Everything's just perfect.
Thank you for making this the third-best day of my life.
Third?
First was having you.
Second was sleeping with a roadie for the Steve Miller Band.
Charles: Oh! I love you, Mom.
I love you. I love you.
[both smooching]
Grab some of those if you're throwing 'em out.
Mwah! [grunts] Mwah!
My mom. [clears throat]
You did so great.
I, however, hit a small snag.
[sobbing]
No! Do not take off that tux, Lynn What are you doing? We had a deal.
I said, ""If you hurt my mother, I will cut off your son's testicles.""
You're right. Cut 'em off!
No! Okay.
As much as I would love to do that, I would like my mom to be happy.
So can you please have a seat? Mm-hmm.
And just explain to me what is going on.
I'm worried I'm just rushing into this.
I barely know your mom.
I don't even know her favorite kind of soup.
Is it tomato?
Nobody likes soup, Lynn.
You're a family of soup-haters.
What have I done? Look.
Do you know why my mom loves you?
Because you take big risks.
Like how you got her that dog on your second date.
[chuckles] Those kind of things just blow up in my face half the time.
I mean, the dog worked out great, but...
The dog was a disaster. She hates it.
But she loved that you took that shot.
Do you know who never, ever rushes into anything?
Cowards.
That's exactly right, Rosa.
Cowards. And you're a weirdo.
I'd call you a hobbit... Yeah.
A human pile of mashed potatoes... Mm-hmm.
But you are no coward, Lynn Boyle.
Lynn Linetti. I'm taking your mother's name.
Oh! You're making this hard.
My mom loves you. You love her.
Now follow your big, weird heart.
Oh, you're right.
It's time for a wedding!
Pants, Dad! Pants!
A wedding with pants! Yeah.
Wedding's starting soon. How are things going?
I was just ordained at www.internetministry4cheap.com, but I'm having some trouble with my speech.
All I've got so far is a poem.
Ooh, a poem. Sounds romantic.
""Marriage is a contract between two adults of different families.""
It's a haiku... and a fact.
It works on two levels.
Uh, it feels a little impersonal.
What did the officiant say when you got married?
Not much. When gay marriage was legalized, we weren't sure if or when it was gonna be struck down, so speed was of the essence.
Do you, Kevin... Yes.
And do you... Yes, yes, we do!
We're married!
I remarked afterwards that I wished the officiant had been more efficient.
[chuckles] It was very funny.
Kevin still talks about it.
Aha! Maybe I should open with that zinger.
It is amazingly funny. Oh.
I'm just not sure this is the right crowd for it.
No zinger? No haiku?
Then I have nothing. Maybe I should wing it.
Love: It sustains you.
It's like... oatmeal.
Okay, okay. Not bad for winging it.
I lied.
Took me two hours to write that.
How do I look? Oh!
You look incredible!
Up high! Down low!
both: Butts, butts, butts.
You're the worst family in history, but at least you're ready.
Scully's run out of songs.
Right now, he's singing.
♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪
Best rock and roll song ever written.
both: Tied with Kokomo.
Hey! So we have good news and we have great news.
The good news is we found the ring.
The great news is we'll never lose it again.
What are you trying to say?
The ring is stuck on his finger.
I told him not to be cute about it.
I'm cute about everything.
Okay, okay, what do we do?
I could pull the ring off, but it might hurt your little fingers.
That's fine. I just won't look so I don't know when you're gonna do it.
Jenny! No!
[bone pops] [screams]
Okay, this is your last chance to carry me bodyguard-style, so...
Absolutely not.
20 years later and I've been Funged again.
She Funged me!
She doesn't seem that great.
We just saw her making out with a guy she barely even knows.
No, it's not her fault.
Did you see that guy's tux jacket?
Four buttons.
We did this. Our s*x made this happen.
Charles, mic's on. We can hear all this, bud.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt. Welcome.
Marriage is a contract... but it's so much more than that.
Marriage is love.
It's commitment, it's joy, it's understanding, it's patience, it's anger, it's reconciliation, it's everything.
It's like oatmeal.
It... sustains you.
Darlene, do you take Lynn to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
Lynn, do you take Darlene to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah! Get it, Daddy!
[applause continues]
Yeah!
I gotta hand it to you, Captain.
That was some ceremony.
It wasn't difficult.
I simply said what I wish had been said when Kevin and I got married.
Oh, then I never would have heard your hilarious ""efficient-officiant"" quip.
Mmm, you're right. I regret nothing.
But all this does make me think I might enjoy a more... festive expression of our commitment to one another.
Are you suggesting we hold an honest to goodness wedding?
Nothing too elaborate.
We're not the Kardashian-Wests, after all.
They are a musician and a celebrity personality who recently wedded.
Yes, yes, I know.
They were answers on Jeopardy.
I think you mean questions.
[both laugh]
You guys are fun.
He's not playing my playlist.
Congratulatis, Charles. Marcus!
Rosa said you weren't coming.
Yeah, I wasn't.
Just got the call about an hour ago.
Oh, but, hey.
I'm DVR-ing Bones, so no spoilers.
Don't worry. I don't watch.
Too scary.
I'm gonna ask the DJ to play Kokomo, and get this place turnt up.
So... I didn't ask you to the wedding because I was being a coward.
I was scared things were moving too quickly, but I don't give a crap.
I love you.
That's all I wanted to say.
If you had plans tonight, you can get out of here.
I love you too.
Doesn't have Kokomo.

Charles: Jake, you gotta see this.
There's something going on here.
Something a little... hairy.
Nope.
Don't see anything out of the ordinary.
Really?
Well, maybe I should... frame the question differently.
Terry, do you notice anything?
Amy?
New shirt?
Oh, come on, guys.
I grew a goatee, and it looks amazing, and I know you can see it.
Of course we can see it, Charles.
It's horrible.
It looks like you unclogged a shower drain with your mouth.
Yeah, you look exactly like the guy in the ""Don't Talk to Strangers"" poster.
No, I don't.
Are you talking about your new goatee?
Mm-hmm.
I think it's a good choice for your face.
Come over here, so I can take a better look.
Thank you, Captain.
I knew you'd appreciate Bianca.
That's right; I call her Bianca because she's dark and thick like my first cousin Bianca.

Hey, Charles.
I want to ask you something, but you have to promise not to get excited and weird.
I can't promise anything of the sort.
It's about restaurants.
[giggles]
I'm so glad I didn't make that promise.
Oh, boy.
All right, where do you take your dad when you want to go someplace special?
Great question.
We go to Csaba.
It's a Hungarian restaurant that serves ""Tál ezer kolbász,"" the platter of a thousand sausages.
Ugh.
It's symbolic of our manhood.
Okay, I should've saved the ""ugh"" till then.
Anyways, I'll try and get a reservation.
My dad's coming into town, and we're going out to dinner tonight.
Why are you going to dinner with him?
He hasn't visited you in six years.
Yeah, he's busy. He's an airline pilot.
Regional airline.
He flies internationally.
[scoffs] Quebec to Albany.
What is going on here?
What's your problem with my dad?
I'm just being wary.
He left you when you were seven, and he's been letting us down ever since.
Us?
I think of you as a brother, Jake, so he didn't just abandon you; He abandoned us.
Look, I know he hasn't been the best dad in the past, but he's changed.
Check it out. We've been texting.
""New phone. Who dis?""
No, below that. Oh.
See, he's coming into town just to see me.
All right, we're gonna go out to dinner tonight, then maybe take a walk through the park, possibly a carriage ride.
If I get chilly, he could loan me his coat.
I'm describing a date.
I don't know what fathers and sons do, but I'm gonna find out!
Terry: Joining us for lunch, sir?
Oh, no, I've already consumed the required calories for this day period.
Yummy.
But I do have some fun lunch chitchat.
When I was a detective, my old c.o., Jim Martins, used to keep us on our toes by have us solve brain teasers.
I thought maybe you'd like to try one.
Don't just tease my brain, Captain.
Really go to town on it.
Yeah, bring it on, sir.
I love puzzles.
They're like power squats for your mind.
Good. Here's a problem.
There are 12 men on an island.
11 weigh exactly the same amount, but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier.
You must figure out which.
And what do these men look like facially and with respect to their bodies?
It's unimportant.
So like Tyrese.
It's a land of Tyreses.
Sure.
The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw.
The exciting catch: You can only use it three times.
That sounds super exciting.
Is this thing mandatory?
Oh, I hope so. Please say yes.
No, but there is a prize for whoever solves it first.
Two tickets to this Sunday's Beyoncé Knowles rock music concert.
I'm in.
Marcus loves Beyoncé.
Everyone loves Beyoncé.
My girls were conceived to Bootylicious.
Don't tell my wife I told you that.
[cell phone chimes]
Whoop.
Guys, my dad just texted. He's in the building.
Scully, stop eating.
Terry, start flexing.
Everybody be cool.
Paging Detective Jake Peralta.
Ah, Dad!
How are you, son?
Good to see you.
Hey.
Everyone, this is my dad.
Hey, introduce yourself in your captain's voice.
Folks, this is your pilot speaking, Captain Roger Peralta.
If you look to your left, you'll see me, making your acquaintance.
Love that.
Hi, I'm Jake's best friend, Charles.
How are you?
Pop quiz: What's Jake allergic to?
Bees. And wasps.
Guy didn't even include wasps.
Huh!
Wasps. Those aren't even real.
Oh, hey, Captain Holt.
Come meet my dad, Captain Peralta.
Hello, Captain. Captain.
This is super weird for me.
Captain. Captain.
Anyways, you guys, my dad is the best pilot.
Oh, come on.
Tell them about Oregon.
Okay, this one time I'm in Eugene, I'm hitching a ride in the jump seat of a commuter jet.
I'm sleeping off a wicked hangover.
Noice.
All of a sudden, there's a jolt and a boom.
A bird. It was a bird.
Yeah, we sucked a bird into our intake.
Next thing I know, the cabin's filling up with smoke, alarm's going off, engine flames out and dies.
We are in a dead stall.
I look over at the pilot, Sam Power...
both: Great name.
He's white as a sheet.
And he says to me... I'll never forget what he said.
He says, ""Bobby's got a big ol' butt.""
Turns out he's having a stroke.
Bring the plane down on a highway, right across from a rest area.
Get on the PA, I say, ""Folks, coffee's on me.""
What? Wow.
Are you kidding me? [applause]
Anyway, I'm not here to talk about me.
I'm here to spend some time with my boy.
Ah, Dad.
It's good to see you. You too.
Oh, hey, let me give you a tour of the precinct.
Cool.
Ooh, you can interrogate one of my perps.
No, he can't. Don't do that, Jake!
You might as well save yourself some paper and give up now, Sarge.
You know I'm going to solve this first.
You probably can't tell, but I'm flexing my brain like crazy right now.
Gina: Yeah, you're both wasting your time.
Beyoncé's my spiritual twin.
Those tickets are my birthright.
No offense, but this is gonna come down to me and the sarge.
Whoa, you think you two are the only ones that can solve puzzles?
Yeah, what about Rosa, Gina, and me?
Is this how you want to die, Hitchcock?
Look, it's just that the sarge and I are really into puzzles.
Remember when I took that Sudoku cruise?
I never even went on deck.
100 bucks says Gina and I can solve this thing before you two puzzle dorks.
[scoffs]
Deal.
You're going down.
You're really not a part of this, Hitchcock.
Jake: [sighs]
Did they bring out more sausage while I was in the bathroom?
No, that's still the first mountain.
Good Lord.
Anyways, do you remember what you always did when you'd take me to dinner as a kid?
Tell the waitress it was your birthday, so we'd get a free dessert?
I already did it.
[scoffs]
I just told them it was your birthday.
Come on.
Looks like we're going to get two free probably disgusting sausage-filled desserts.
This is pretty fun, right?
I mean, we're actually bonding.
Jake, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Last week I was flying into Albany from Quebec, you know how I always keep my snowboard with me in case I get a chance to carve...
So cool.
Well, Canadian customs found some prescription meds in my board bag.
They're accusing me of smuggling.
What?
Yeah, I have no idea how they got in there.
They're not mine.
But it's bad.
I could lose my pilot's license.
But you're the best pilot in the world, I'm guessing without knowing anything about the field.
I'm really in a bind here.
Jake, I need your help.
That's actually the reason I'm here.
Oh.
That's the reason.
Happy sausage birthday to both of you.
[all singing in Hungarian]
♪ ♪
All right, let's talk about my dad's case.
The case of why he came to town?
I solved it: Because he wanted to take advantage of his son.
Jake: Okay, fine.
First I was a little upset, but then I realized this is great.
You know, we'll get to spend some time together, and he'll see what a good cop I am.
He should already think you're great.
Like with my dad, he doesn't need me to prove to him that Jake Peralta is the best cop in the precinct.
He knows it!
Tell us about the case.
Here's what we know so far.
One, Hungarian sausage is an oily mess, and it causes nonstop dumps.
The incontinence is a small price to pay for the deliciousness.
It's disgusting, and it was a terrible recommendation.
Two, the Canadian cops think that my dad used his security clearance to smuggle in over a thousand pills of Turgidol.
Canadian erection medication.
Very potent.
What? I don't need it.
[whispers] But I love it.
Oh, boy.
Three, the case against him looks pretty solid.
Four, he's never been a good dad to Jake.
Five, he has been a good dad, especially from ages zero through seven and yesterday through forever.
Six, nonstop dumps.
Holt: Enough. How did you read these files?
They're in French.
Scully translated them for me.
When I was nine, my parents took me to Paris, and they accidentally left me at the Louvre.
By the time they figured it out, they were already back in Queens.
Okay, no one cares about your boring life, Scully.
This is about my dad and proving his innocence.
Sir, I'd like to go to Canada for a few days and help him out.
Of course, but take Boyle with you.
It'd be good to have an objective set of eyes.
Fine, but under protest because he's a jerk.
Also, we'd like to take Scully with us.
Well, perfect.
I do you a favor; You do me one too.
Thank you.
All right, there is no way we let Amy and the sarge beat us.
We sit here until we figure this thing out.
Rosa, my mind is ready.
Okay.
""There's an island with 12 men.""
Oh, I'm so bored. I cannot do it.
I can do this.
One guy's slightly heavier.
There's a seesaw.
I got it.
You use the seesaw to press down on their necks until fatty confesses.
Incorrect. Damn.
And disturbing.



Roger: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain speaking.
That's my dad.
The captain talking right now, I came out of his body.
No big deal.
We're headed for an on-time arrival in Drummondville, Quebec.
Folks, this is a special flight for me, because sitting in seat 3B is my son, Jake Peralta, one of New York's finest.
[applause] Oh.
Thanks, Dad!
Love you too.
Got to admit, it was pretty nice of him to bump us up to first class.
Ugh, this plush fabric is making my rump sweat.
Maybe you're just a little too uncultured to enjoy such a sophisticated kind of an experience.
Oh, brother.
[English accent] What do you say there, Scully, old boy?
Look at this nut mix: It's half cashews!
I hope we never land!
So loud.
Hey, guys.
How you enjoying the flight?
So how's the case going?
Oh, good.
We already have four suspects who work at the airport, and I want to talk to your girlfriend, Denise, because she had access to your bags.
Not on the night in question.
She's been spending some time at her place.
Relationships are complicated.
You cheated on her a bunch, and she found out.
Okay, I deserve that.
Charles, I have cheated on women in the past and on this one too.
You got a penchant for blondes.
Hey, come on, you can't blame a guy for occasionally dropping anchor at the cold Commodore Club.
[laughter]
So seriously, Jake, this is going to be okay?
Oh, yeah. You're going to be fine.
Yeah.
Oh, my God, Jake.
Who's flying the plane?
Co-pilot, Scully. Co-pilot.
Okay, look.
Let's try a new approach.
We weigh these three islanders against these three islanders.
If they weigh the same, we eliminate them, and if they don't, we...
Where'd they go?
Terry's mouth is full of donuts.
You said we could eliminate 'em!
Only if they weigh the same.
We've been here forever.
I'm getting snacky.
Fine. Let's start over.
Okay, we balance three against three, and if they weigh the same, we just...
What just happened?
Come on, man.
Stop eating the islanders.
I'm saving them from this weight-obsessed nightmare island.
By murdering them?
I warned you against using donuts.
They're my trigger food.
Mmm. Terry.
These islanders are delicious.
Okay, so two of our suspects are in the baggage area.
Do you think you can get us access?
You're with a pilot. I can get you in anywhere.
Hey, you guys want a 10% discount on duty-free maple syrup?
Do I ever!
man with French accent: Roger Peralta.
Roger Peralta... [speaking French]
Hey! What?
Scully, what's going on?
[speaking French]
Scully: ""Roger Peralta is under arrest for possession of a controlled substance.""
What? [speaking French]
""They found pills in his apartment.""
Roger: Jake, I don't know what he's talking about.
I swear I don't know how those pills got in my apartment.
Wait. Jake.
Scully, tell them we're cops.
Tell them!
[speaks French]
Shoot.
That means ""turnip.""
I said we were turnips.
I got it. Don't worry.
We are turnips!
Nope, that was English. Yeah.
The cops said your dad's being held without bail, they want us on the next flight out, and that Bernard's is the best poutine place in the airport.
You want some?
No, I don't want poutine right now.
Yes!
Man, I can't believe they found pills at my dad's place.
That means none of our suspects could've possibly done it.
Oh, my God, Boyle.
Is there a chance that my dad is actually a drug smuggler?
Well, let's look at the facts.
Drugs in his luggage, drugs in his apartment.
Terrible dad, terrible husband, cheats on his girlfriend.
I think he did it.
You're right.
He didn't do it.
That's not what I said.
No, you said he cheats on his girlfriend.
Presumably, he has to do that with someone, and that someone would have access to his apartment and his bags.
Dad dropped anchor at the Commodore's Club.
""Someone"" is there.
Even so, how do we get in there?
By wearing Dad's pilot uniforms.
No, Jake, I just don't think he's innocent, and I just think...
So you don't want to be my co-pilot?
I'm in!

Are you here because you've solved my brain teaser?
Sir, you've been an underdog your whole life.
But you defied the odds by having others secretly help you 'cause you didn't have what it took.
That's not my story.
But now we're the underdogs, and we're the ones who need a handout, so just tell us the answer.
Or have you forgotten where you come from?
I'm not gonna help you.
I told you that was not gonna work.
Stop the clock.
We're here, and we have the solution.
First, you weigh six versus six.
Wrong. That'll never work.
You just wasted your time and mine.
Click!
I just captured the exact moment when you realized you had failed.
I guess we all got something out of this.
Holt: So that's it?
This problem is beyond all of you?
No one solved it.
Believe me.
No one is more disappointed in me than me.
""Than I,"" Santiago.
[whispering] Click.
Hi there. Yeah, that's us.
Home sweet home.
Got dem wings.
Yeah.
Ooh. Okay.
Boom, right there, behind the bar.
That's my dad's type.
Oh, he likes 'em neat and clean, real tidy.
What?
No, blondes. He likes blondes.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna go sit down, order a couple of drinks, grab her fingerprints off the glass she serves us, and then measure her wrist for handcuff size.
Ready? Yeah.
Oh, crazy flight.
Charles: Oh, those hydraulics were loud.
Yeah.
Ah, bonjour, bonjour.
Two whiskeys, please, Chantelle.
Thanks.
Say, I'm looking for an old sky pal of mine.
Do you know Roger Peralta?
Yes. Yes, I do.
How do you guys know Peralta?
Oh, I used to fly with him back in Oregon.
My name's Captain Spike Masters.
This is my co-pilot Wanda Cohen.
Charles: I drive the plane when he sleeps.
I also take care of hotel accommodations.
Where'd you guys say you flew in from?
Akron. Luxembourg.
Connected in Akron.
Took the old 78... 9er on the wind stream.
You know, flight stuff.
Anyhow...
[sighs]
Can we grab those two whiskeys, please?
I do not know who you are, and I do not think you are pilots.
Your suit doesn't even fit.
Ah.
I had my stomach stapled.
Sécurité! Sécurité!
[speaking French]
Ah! Unhand us.
This is outrageous.
I demand to speak with the commodore himself.
There's no way we'll get her fingerprints now.
Oh, really?
Voilà.
French.
She cleaned the bar quite thoroughly, but this bottle is filthy with her prints.
Smurt.
That's why you're the pilot, and I'm the co-pilot.
Copy that, Wanda.
Copy that.
Wanda Cohen.
Rosa: Wait, Captain.
Gina and I figured out your dumb brain teaser.
I highly doubt that, sir.
I'll judge for myself, Santiago.
Okay, Diaz.
What's the solution?
We have no idea.
Ha! Told ya.
But neither do you, sir.
What?
Captain Holt, you don't know what the solution is.
Excuse me?
Here's how we cracked it.
I took the photo of you demolishing Amy's spirit and made these clever T-shirts that say, ""#nerdfail.""
It's not that clever.
It's hilarious.
Look at this.
Your expression is the same as Amy's because you're both devastated that you just let down your mentors.
Gina: I looked at your calendar.
You're supposed to have breakfast with your old c.o.
You wanted us to solve the problem before you saw him.
That's crazy.
She's right.
What? No.
He posed that problem to me 20 years ago.
Every time I see him, he asks, ""Do you have the answer yet?""
And I never have.
Those islanders and their pathetic seesaw haunt my dreams.
They mock me in my sleep, riding up and down on a teeter-totter of taunts.
Cool.
So who gets the Beyoncé tickets?
Jake: ♪ O Canada ♪
♪ You home of crappy cops ♪
Guess who just freed his dad from Canadian prison and slammed six free mimosas on the first-class flight home sans the juice?
Spoiler alert, it was Jake.
It was me.
So turns out my dad's sidepiece framed him.
She was hella pissed 'cause she found out about his real girlfriend and his other sidepiece.
So yeah.
Turns out my dad is a great guy after all.
And in celebration of my freedom, I'm taking everybody out tonight.
Drinks are on me.
Jake: Eh?
Where's Scully?
Scully. Oh, no.
Who?
Jake: Hey, Hank.
When you see my dad walk in, can you dim the lights and play We Are the Champions?
No.
I don't know what your dad looks like, I don't have the song... [phone chimes]
And the lights aren't on dimmers.
Oh, no. It's okay, Jake.
You give me the signal, I'll start unscrewing bulbs.
No, my dad just texted.
He's not coming.
To Jake's dad!
[all cheer]
Yep.
Sorry, Jake.
I'm sure your dad has a really good reason for not being here.
No, don't do that, all right?
Don't let him off the hook.
That's what I've done my whole life.
You know, when he missed my 11th birthday, I blamed myself for being born on a peak travel day.
You were right about him, Boyle.
So what do we do now?
Hug for ten minutes.
No, give me a rain check on the hug.
There's something I got to do.
You can have my beer. Cool.
[knocks on door]
Jake.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the party.
I'm subbing for a buddy who's got an early flight.
I'm sure you're upset.
No, actually, I'm not upset at all.
Yeah?
Great.
No, more relieved.
You know, you were always my hero, but I think I'm finally starting to see you for who you really are: A regional airline pilot whose landings are bumpy as hell and a pretty selfish guy who genuinely doesn't care about being a dad.
Jake, you don't understand.
There was a downdraft on the Drummondville runway.
Oh, wow.
It's not my fault.
Yeah, clearly.
Look, I've been making excuses for you my whole life, but you're a pretty crappy father, and until you're ready to be a good one, don't call me.
Also I'm taking your captain hat because it's cool, and I want it.
Norman Greenbaum: ♪ Going up to the spirit in the sky ♪
♪ Spirit in the sky ♪
♪ That's where I'm gonna go when I die ♪
I got to say, figuring out Captain Holt didn't know the answer was an incredible solve.
I'm sorry if we implied you weren't smart.
Oh, and I'm sorry if we implied you're both asexual nerds who can only be friends with service animals.
You didn't.
Rosa: Not to your face, but to a ton of people behind your back.
Thanks for the drink.
Yes.
Next round's on me.
It's the least I can do for teasing your brains so mercilessly.
So what are you gonna say to your old c.o. tomorrow when he asks if you've solved the puzzle?
I don't know.
Thanks for bringing that up.
Fun chat.
Gina: Just say you're a captain now, and you're busy running a precinct, so he can go suck an egg.
Or we can all work together all night long, and I'm sure we can eventually figure it out.
I like that, Terry. It shows real heart.
But I'm going with Gina's ""suck an egg"" idea.
You get the Beyoncé tickets.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Of course I do.
I told you.
It was my birthright, you bitches.
Superglue your panties to your butts, ladies, because Jake is in the house!
What?
Never mind.
I'm a little drunk. Ah.
I'm also worried about you.
Come here. Ten-minute hug time.
I'd rather not.
Come on. Okay.
Boyle, release him.
Fine, only because you're ordering me to.
There's nine minutes left on that hug.
Great.
Heh.
Nice job in Quebec.
I bet the local cops weren't happy you showed them up.
Yeah, well, maybe not at first.
But by the end, they kept calling me a real bâtard, which I can only assume means ""hero.""
It means ""b*st*rd,"" but that's only because they were jealous.
You did good work.
Here.
Is this an allowance?
Are you giving me an allowance?
No, I'm paying the bartender for more drinks.
Oh, right.
I'm proud of you.
Charles: Nine minutes start now!

The muggings were confined to Cabot Street.
They began over two months ago...
Just like this briefing did.
Please go to charisma class.
I'm here. I'm here. Sorry, Charles.
Charles: No, Jake.
Never apologize for making an amazing entrance.
My power went out last night, and my alarm didn't go off.
Your alarm is power-dependent?
You brought this on yourself, son.
The point is, it will not happen again.
Carry on.
Sorry I'm late, Sarge.
No hot water this morning.
But I'm here, ready to go.
Will cause no further distractions.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Seriously?
What is your excuse today?
More bad luck.
My car ran out of gas, and then my clothes disappeared from the Laundromat.
I had to beg one of my neighbors to loan me some of his.
You never told us Sinbad lives in your building.
If Sinbad lived in my building, I would have a tattoo on my forehead that said ""Sinbad lives in my building.""
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, and I'm a half an hour early.
That's right, my string of bad luck has finally come to an end.
Peralta, you failed your drug test.
There were traces of cocaine and methamphetamines found in your urine.
What?
♪ ♪
Jake: Captain, this is insane.
I don't do drugs.
I mean, sure, a couple of my teeth are loose, but that's from dental neglect, not meth.
Yeah, those tests are unreliable.
Okay, let's not blame ""tests.""
I believe in you, Jake, but come on, he's going after tests.
Sir, listen: the missing laundry, the hot water, the power, the gas, now this?
This is not bad luck, it's a pattern.
Someone's trying to sabotage me.
And who would want to do that?
Probably someone I put away.
It's the only explanation.
Or you didn't pay your bills and you only put a quarter gallon of gas in your tank 'cause you wanted to spend the rest on mini-mart beef jerky.
Wrong, I buy my jerky online from the world's top jerkmasters, so it looks like you need to update your jerk Rolodex, which is not as dirty as it sounds.
Anyway, I can prove that I filled up my tank, all right?
I even have a receipt, because I keep all my receipts like a mature adult person.
Laser tag, wheelie shoes, remote control monster truck, aha!
Gas station.
Someone drained my tank.
Okay, I know you don't do drugs, so maybe there is something to what you're saying.
I'll talk to One Police Plaza and arrange an appeal.
I'll also put someone on this sabotage theory.
I got it.
Jake, when I find whoever did this to you, I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs and fill their sockets...
I think you might be too close to this.
Copy that.
Santiago, Diaz: look into it.
Noice.
In the meantime, Peralta, you're suspended.
I'm gonna need you to hand in your badge and gun.
All right, fine, you can have my badge and gun, but we're doing it in your office so I can slam them down on your desk and yell out, ""The system stinks!""
Actually, the procedure is to bring your gun and badge down to the equipment room on the second floor, fill out form 452-underscore-J, hand said form in to the inventory clerk, and then receive a claim check through interoffice mail.
The system stinks!
Terry: Hey, Boyle, any progress with that extortion case you and Jake have been working on?
No, I've just been going over his notes.
Look how cool and illegible his handwriting is.
Oh, I wish I could be that free.
But you know me, ever the calligrapher.
Yeah, well, I thought you might need a little more manpower.
Okay.
So I'm assigning you a new partner.
Actually, partners.
Yep, there's definitely something in there.
Looks like a peanut.
Bet it's a cashew.
You're on.
No, Sarge, come on!
They're terrible.
Stop exaggerating, Boyle.
They're good detectives.
They're fine.
Scully: Oh, no.
I pushed it in deeper.
They're all we got.
Terry: Sir, Gina's dance concert was last night.
Right.
The Dancy Reagan performance.
I've been so preoccupied with Peralta's drug test, it totally slipped my mind.
Me too.
But don't worry.
I told her we were there.
Was your favorite move ""The Gull""?
Or was it ""Space Bubbles""?
Oh, I loved them both!
I'm a bubble man and a gull man!
[both laughing]
You lied to her?
Like a pro.
I couldn't hurt her feelings.
She really wanted us to be there.
Well, I wish you hadn't involved me in your deception.
I maintain a strict code of integrity.
Come on, Captain.
You never told a white lie to make a person feel better?
I only lie when someone's safety is at risk.
Or if a juvenile aged eight years or younger asks about Santa Claus.
In which case...
I feed them some reassuring pap about the logical impossibility of proving a negative.
It's sentimental drivel, but they eat it up.
So... does this mean you're gonna blow up my spot and tell Gina the truth?
If she asks me, then yes, I suppose I will have to blow your spot right up.
Jake: Okay, this is everyone I could think of who would want to mess with my life.
Perps, people I've testified against, the old guy who lived underneath me when I was learning the Gangnam Style dance.
Wow, you've pissed off a lot of people.
Well, that's what happens when you live out loud, Rosa.
We need to look into the power outage and hot water.
Do you have proof you pay your bills?
Are you serious?
Guys, this is not my fault.
My reputation is being sabotaged by some guy.
Or girl, you know.
Monsters can be women too.
Rosa: Super progressive attitude, Jake.
Look, we are on your side.
It's just, you're not the most responsible person.
We have to do our job.
All right, fine. You can see my bank records.
But I always pay my power bill.
Often late.
One time in person with Canadian pennies.
Oh, my God, talking about your finances makes me sweat behind the knees.
Nice.
Hey, speaking of funky smells, should we start this investigation at the urinalysis lab?
Hmm? Take a trip to the old pee factory?
Jake, you're suspended.
Just go home, have a beer, and smash something.
That's what I'd do.
Or take advantage of this amazing city.
Go sightseeing.
MoMA has an exhibit I'm dying to see.
It's all about office chair design.
Oh!
Look, I know technically I'm not supposed to help out, but rules are made to be broken.
They were made to be followed.
Nothing is made to be broken.
Uh, piñatas.
Glow sticks.
Karate boards.
Spaghetti when you have a small pot.
Rules.
Look, someone's messing with my life here.
I thought you guys had my back.
We do.
But seriously, you can't come with us.
Okay.
Fine. I get it.
Protocol's protocol.
I'm gonna go check out that office chair design exhibit at the MoMA.
Jake: Rosa? Amy?
What are you guys doing here?
Our non-suspended jobs.
You're not supposed to be investigating.
I'm not, I'm sightseeing, just as Amy suggested.
At Brooklyn Urine and Blood?
Oh, yeah, the internet says this is the number-one urinalysis lab in all of New York.
Fun tourist selfie!
Boink! Not your best.
Anyways, I'm gonna take a ""walking tour"" in here while you guys ask a couple of questions, and also, I've been waiting for 20 minutes.
Where have you been?
We had to find the addresses of all 78 people you said might want to hurt you.
Uh-huh.
And was there another stop along the way?
We got coffee.
Those are cappuccinos.
You know how long it takes to foam that milk?
Time you could have spent on my case, but I guess it's just froth over friends with you two.
Anyways, let's do this.
Amy: Jake...
I can't believe I'm about to say this.
I really wish you could come look at urine with us, but you can't.
You're suspended. Go home.
All right, fine.
If you guys won't help me, I guess I'll just get myself off.
Context.
Context was important on that one.
I get Greek yogurt, 'cause there's heritage there, but lceland?
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, Gina!
What are you guys talking about? Yogurt? Me too.
Let's keep talking about that.
Whoo!
Terry's out of breath.
Cool. I was just dropping off some files.
Great, let's just go out to your desk and let's talk about how that went.
Okay, Terry.
But first, I want to ask the captain for his impresh of my show.
Got any feed-b, or was it just love, love, love?
Well, actually...
Terry: I thought it was amazing!
You were like a swan who went to Juilliard.
It was so good.
Terry, I have already received your praise.
I'm clearly fishing in another pond right now.
I'm putting an end to this.
Sergeant Jeffords and I were unable to attend your performance.
Oh.
But you were so spot on with your compliments.
Terry is a practiced liar.
I'm sorry we missed the show.
I know that dancing is an important hobby to you.
Hobby?
You think my dancing is a hobby?
Oh, yes.
Like me and antique globe collecting.
It's thrilling, but nobody is ever going to pay me for it.
Ergo, a hobby.
I get paid... in applause.
But apparently not yours.
I know that maintaining integrity can be difficult, but in the long run, everyone is better for it.
[electronic grinding]
Attention everyone.
The tragic sound you hear is the shredding of my spandie.
Gina Linetti will never dance again.
So those threatening phone calls were being made to Tim Orsk of Tim O's Limos.
That's interesting.
This Orsk guy's name keeps cropping up in this case.
'Cause he's the victim.
You know, he's the guy whose window was smashed with this rock.
Okay?
He's being extorted for $10,000.
Sure, but what do they want from him?
$10,000.
I just said that.
We're trying to figure out who's doing the threatening.
Wait. I have a theory.
I think ""limousine"" and ""magazine"" come from the same word.
Just focus!
I'm sorry for snapping.
I interviewed Orsk...
Orsk! There it is again.
Oh, you're useless!
You're completely useless!
You are without a doubt the most incompetent detectives I've ever seen.
And I'm including that bomb-sniffing dog who humps all the bombs!



Rosa: You know your turning signal's been on for 30 seconds.
I like to announce my turning intention.
This isn't the Indy 500.
Well, when you finally change lanes an hour from now, we should go talk to Jake's super... see if there was a power outage.
What? [both scream]
Oh!
Why would you do that?
I just broke into your car and then popped up without warning.
Not cool.
What the hell are you doing?
I thought I was hitching a ride to Rikers so we could interview some convicts I put away, but apparently you're still wasting time investigating me.
Hey, it's your fault we have to check up on your power outages.
You have three mini-fridges plugged in to the same outlet.
Three mini-fridges are cheaper than one regular one.
We're just doing our jobs.
Why don't you trust us?
How can I?
You didn't even know a man was lying in the backseat of your car.
And while you two were busy lolly-gargling...
I'm not familiar with the expression...
I was investigating. I'll send you some selfies.
Look, we're gonna get to your list.
We just have to rule out other possibilities first.
You know, there is a real chance that no one is after you.
Yeah, but I'm telling you that someone is.
That should be enough.
And we told you to trust us.
That should be enough.
All right, fine. You don't want my help?
You're not gonna get it.
Dude...
In fact, I'm deleting your numbers from my phone.
Just let us take you home.
See you never.
Fine.
Where am I?
[ice cream truck jingle playing]
[engine revving]
Hello, Peralta.
Jake: Geoffrey Hoytsman?
You're the one who's been sabotaging me?
I'm just ruining your life like you ruined mine.
You never should have arrested me.
But I basically got your cocaine charges dropped.
You only had to do 40 hours of community service.
Right, but I wanted to get them all done at once, so for energy, I did way too much cocaine and meth.
Went on a prolonged psychotic episode involving assault, public fornication, and, apparently, the touching of my scrotum to every doorknob in a synagogue.
And you know what happened then?
They thoroughly cleaned the synagogue, you landed on your feet and pursued your true passion of selling ice cream?
None of that.
I lost my job and my wife and my home.
An ex-client lent me this truck.
He likes me because I got him off on a strangle-and-mangle.
You have a phrase for that?
I used to, when I was an awesome lawyer.
Now I'm just another idiot living in an ice cream truck.
So that's why you put drugs in my urine.
Hey, that was my urine.
Your urine is in there.
Why would you keep my pee?
I need belongings, Jake, to feel like a man.
Look, this is a bad idea, Hoytsman.
People are gonna notice if I disappear.
See? Someone's already looking for me.
You're in big trouble, buddy.
Your e-coupon for Big Mike's Calzones expires today.
You're damn right.
And if I don't redeem that, Big Mike is gonna get real suspicious.
Big Mike is a cartoon with pizzas for eyes.
All right, fine.
Maybe not Big Mike, but someone will.
Shut up, Peralta!
Oh, boy.
Captain Holt, here's your CompStat report.
This is how I move now.
Walking is too close to dancing, and there's no more dance in me.
Plus I'm hoping my leg muscles will atrophy so I won't be tempted to use them.
I bet you feel real good about calling her dancing hobby, huh?
Sarcasm... the coward's lie.
I don't get it.
Gina's always so sure of herself.
She usually doesn't care at all what people say or think about her.
Maybe not with most people, Captain.
But she cares what you think.
[chair dragging]
Fine. I regret what I said.
But now, I don't know how to make it right with her.
Lie!
Look, yesterday I told my twins there were baby bunnies in their stomachs to get them to eat lettuce.
And that worked?
Yeah, but then they refused to drink their milk because they thought the bunnies would drown.
So I bought a couple rabbits and told the girls that they hopped out of their mouths while they slept.
I've lost track of your point.
They ate their lettuce, I'm stuck with two bunnies, and lying works!
[muffled yelling]
Pretty good gag, huh?
A prostitute taught me how to make it.
Ugh. Where were you?
You were gone for three hours.
I know because I sang ""This ls How We Do it"" 143 times.
Okay, well, I had to grab a few things at the art supply store.
Kidnapping is 90% crafting.
Jake, you're gonna help me get my life back.
You're gonna confess, on video, to framing me for everything that got me in trouble.
And why would I do that?
Because I'm high on bath salts, emotionally unstable, and pointing a gun at you.
Let's make a movie!
Hitchcock: Hey, Boyle, guess who caught the Tim O's Limos perp.
Jake?
Is Jake back?
No, we did.
Scully and Hitchcock.
Signed confession.
You called us useless.
You called us incompetent.
You called us zeros in the sack.
Never happened.
Well, someone said it to me last night.
Oh, uh, must have been my wife.
How did you solve the case?
We listened to those voicemails again and noticed the sound of parrots in the background.
Got a list of employees, did door duty asking neighbors if any of them kept pet birds.
Hitchcock: We finally found one who did, and guess what.
The landscaping in front of his building was covered with these.
Scully: Same type of rock that was thrown through the window.
I can't believe it.
What, you don't think it could break one?
Watch.
I meant I can't believe you solved the case.
Well, you were wrong on that too.
Hi. My name is Jake Peralta, and this is my confession.
I destroyed the good name of an American hero...
Geoffrey Hoytsman.
I framed him for drug possession, I got him fired from his job, and I planted his scrotal prints on the synagogue doorknobs.
Great, now just eighty more confessions to go.
You've been very naughty.
I threatened to blow Mr. Hoytsman's head off if he didn't quote-unquote ""really cheap out on his dad's funeral.""
And while he slept, I logged in to Hoytsman's computer and flooded it with Thai pornography.
Starts crying.
""Starts crying"" is a stage direction, you imbecile!
Also, I fathered two children with Hoytsman's cleaning lady, and it was I, disguised as Geoffrey, who spoke against her at her political asylum hearing.
God.
You did it, not me.
I am a horrible person who has done horrible things to a truly decent man, which is why I've decided to take my own life.
Wait, no, I didn't decide that.
Spoiler alert!
Jake on video: Decided to take my own life.
That last take sounded great.
You really brought my words to life.
You know, I should write more.
What a rush!
Hoytsman, you don't have to do this.
Your life's not so bad.
Living in an ice cream truck? Never showering?
That was my childhood dream.
I had everything.
I had friends, a wife, two beautiful children... out of three total.
Not a bad ratio.
And now I have nothing and no one.
Look, I get it.
I know what that feels like.
You've only lived in an ice cream truck for part of one day!
How could you possibly know?
Well, I know no one's coming to rescue me.
I was so concerned with saving myself and my reputation I pushed all my friends away.
Wow.
Sounds like you're having a breakthrough.
You should act on this.
You still have time to make it right.
Really? You're not gonna kill me?
Oh, jeez.
I totally forgot.
Thanks for reminding me. Of course I'm gonna kill you.
Drugs make me say such silly things.
Drugs are so silly.
Ooh, I'm gonna do some right now.
Hoytsman.
What?
Hyah!
Oh!
God! That's my nose!
That's where I put the drugs in!
Gyah!
Oh!
[grunting]
So long, Hoytsman.
Hyah!
I can't move!
I'm turtling. I'm turtling!
Nice try, Jake.
Get up!
I can't.
Oh.
Yeah. Okay. My bad.
What's this?
I'm selling my smoke machine, glitter cannon, and castanets.
I would've put my soul on there, but that was shredded along with my spandies.
Gina, I want to tell you something.
Dancing is more than just a hobby for you.
It's a profession.
Oh, so you're a liar like Terry now?
No, I'm no bunny-buying coward.
You are a professional dancer, because I'm paying Dancy Reagan to perform two shows at our at-risk youth program.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Captain.
You just made me the happiest, prettiest, most talented girl in the world.
This is the best $8,000 you ever spent.
It's $200.
I'm sure you're good for the rest.
Captain loves my dancing.
Hoytsman: This is why you're alone, Jake.
We were bonding, talking about our pain, and you pull a stunt like that?
You were gonna kill me.
Deflect, deflect, deflect.
This is why everyone hates you.
woman: You open?
Okay. You keep it shut.
I really need this sale.
Hello, ma... whoa!
[crying]
Don't hurt me!
I'm someone's little boy.
Geoffrey Hoytsman, you're under arrest.
Ow.
Oh, I am so relieved you guys found me.
Wait, how did you find me?
You hadn't done anything super annoying to us for, like, five hours, so we knew something was wrong.
Oh, that's very insulting but dead on.
We looked through those irritating selfies you sent us, and in the background of three of them was an ice cream truck.
We ran the plates and put out an APB.
I'm sorry we doubted anybody was sabotaging you.
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
For some reason, I have trouble believing people actually have my back.
I don't know why.
Probably my dad abandoning me.
Maybe something I should work out in therapy, but... who has an hour to spare once every two weeks, right?
Anyways, I'm sorry I acted like a jackass.
Wow, Jake, you're so sincere since you got off coke.
And meth. That was the hard one to kick.
No, the hard one to kick is angel dust, which is why I am locked in for life.
Hey.
I double checked your evidence.
Everything looks good.
I got to say... you guys are good cops.
Hyeah, no doy!
How do you think we got to be the oldest guys here?
By never being promoted and losing all your money to divorces?
And bad investments.
Anyway, I'm sorry for calling you useless.
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows you did good.
Boyle, please don't.
Don't?
Hitchcock: The last thing we need is to suddenly be on everyone's A list.
The ones to watch.
The golden boys.
Pair of red hot dicks.
No one calls detectives that anymore.
People call detectives that?
Hitchcock: All that investigating was exhausting.
Besides, we did our share of that in the '70s and '80s.
Now we like to do paperwork in our comfy chairs.
If we're away from our desks for too long, they'll update our computers, and we'll lose Minesweeper.
So please, don't tell anyone about the amazing work we did today.
I never said ""amazing.""
You kind of just did your jobs.
There you go.
No, really.
I mean, you also broke a window.
Now you get it.
Holt: Your suspension has been lifted, Peralta.
Well, that's great news, sir.
And now it is time for the traditional handing back of gun and badge to the vindicated hero ceremony.
Everyone in!
I don't have your gun or your badge.
Just take form 891-underscore-J down to the equipment room and retrieve your things there.
I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable.
Come on, Captain. I need this.
We all need this!
[all talking at once]
Fine. Fine.
If this will make you happy...
I believe these belong to you.
Congratulations.
[applause]
That's very nice. Thank you.
But as I've said before, the system stinks, and this isn't over.
I say we march down to city hall!
Get out of my office.
Yup.

Heads up... there's our perp, looking all perpy, just perping his way down Perp Street.
Take a picture!
Give me one second.
This light is really unflattering for his complexion.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Tom Olson is a bad dude.
He's held up four electronic stores at gunpoint.
Man, I wish you hadn't read that Annie Leibovitz book.
Quit calling it a book. It was a visual journey.
You probably think I should shoot this in color instead of black and white.
Yes! Shoot color!
Why have you been shooting black and white?
Wait. Where's he going now?
Come on.

Well, thank you, pimpin' playa.
Whoa. That is not a pimp walk.
That's a limp walk.
You sure you should be here today, Jake?
I mean, you wiped out hard.
It wasn't so much a wipeout as it was a controlled power fall, Sarge.
Well...
That's his disagreement squeak.
You wiped out. What'd the doctor say?
Welcome; We haven't seen you in 11 years.
Haven't been to the doctor in 11 years.
How trill is that?
Your tone's braggy, but your words are real sad.
Hmm.
Did he clear you for active duty?
First of all, the doctor was a woman.
There's a such thing as women doctors, Sarge.
I lied for effect. It was a man.
And he said that I was perfectly fine, except for three cracked ribs and a broken toe, which were right next to two other broken toes.
Did he clear you or not?
[laughing] He did not. All right.
Let's get to work, guys. We got a perp to catch.
Oh, forget that. Uh-uh. No. Look.
There's a APB out for your guy.
Lots of cops are looking for him.
You don't need to be here.
Sarge, I know this case better than anyone, and I am this close to solving it.

Your fingers are really far apart.
Yeah, I also have a hairline fracture in my thumb.
Mankind's least important finger... am I right?
Sarge, please.
Please. Please, please, please.
Just let me stay on the case, all right?
I promise I won't go into the field or do anything dangerous.
Fine.
You can work the case from right here, but you are tied to your desk.
Ooh. Tied to my desk.
Mr. Grey will see you now, Sarge.
You wanted to see me, sir?
We have a situation, and it's bad.
Check your e-mail.
No.
Yes.
Kevin insists on you and Marcus joining us for dinner at our house.
But we agreed to keep our personal and professional lives separate.
It is weird enough I am dating your nephew without dragging your husband and dog into it.
You think I want this?
Because I do not want this.
Sadly, Marcus and Kevin can be held off no longer.
Okay.
So what's our play here?
My stomach's a little off.
I could say I'm sick.
Well, I've used the sick excuse for you eight times.
I think they're catching on.
You could say you're sick.
No one would ever believe that.
No. This is happening.
But don't worry.
I have a plan to keep things from getting too personal.
I'm inviting some intimacy buffers.
Dinner party at your house?
Oh, mama!
Gina: I will be there.
All I ask is that you clear the furniture out of your living room so I can show Kev some of my new dance opera.
Why just some of it?
Do the whole thing.
Yes; Nothing would make me happier.
See you Thursday at 8:00.
Copy that, Cap-i-tan!

Yes.
This is wonderful.

Excuse me.
Did you not just hear me say, ""Later, skater""?
All right. Fine.
There's a slight chance that, in the past, I may have tried a little too hard around the captain.
So this time, I'm gonna be super chill.
Good plan.
Whoa!

What?
Oh, honey.
Oh. I get it.
You're joking.
See? I'm cool.
I get jokes.
Boyle, have you seen Jake?
No.
I was out getting him some healing broth.
I was torn between chicken or beef, but then it hit me.
Goat!
[crashing]
What happened? I heard a bang!
No. No bang. Everything's totally normal.
Really?
It looks, to me, like you did something stupid like try to lift a heavy box.
Sarge, come on. In my condition?
Suck it, MacGyver.
[grunts]
[crashing]
Pretty elegant solution, right?
No!
Everything fell everywhere.
All you had to do was sit at your desk.
What is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
I'm just trying to solve this case, and everyone's making a huge deal because I have a few minor injuries to my ribs, ankle, hand, toes, and jaw.
Jaw?
Yeah, that just happened.
I got hit in the face with a box.
But look. I'm fine.
I promise you.
No, you're not.
I'm done with this, Peralta.
Go home and get better.
Now!
All right, fine.
But I'm taking this box of evidence with me.

You're supposed to take a full week off of work.
Come on, Sarge.
Does it look like I'm on the job?
Okay then.
What are you doing here?
Taking your advice to rest and relax to the next level.
Swinging by to pick up Charles, and then we're headed to sunny, beachy, only recently devastated by a financial crisis Atlantic cit-ay!
That's right, suckers.

No, it is not, but it is the world-famous Seafam Motel!

The Ravenna had a four-star restaurant.
This place has a weird amount of dead seagulls, even for AC.
All right. Fine.
It's not a vacation.
It's a stakeout.
My perp has a brother who lives in this dump, and I think he's hiding out with him here.
Seriously?
I was looking forward to this trip.
I can't believe you lied to me.
It wasn't a lie.
It was... an illusion!
All right. It was a lie. I'm sorry.
I had to make it sound really cool so you'd drop everything and come with me.
I can't let Olson walk, and I can't catch him alone.
Plus, this is gonna be super fun!
New trip nickname: AC/DC.
Atlantic City Detectives Club.
Oh... Okay! Fine!
You know I can't say no to a good trip nickname.
There he is. Ugh! Arm! Rib!
Arm! Rib! Shoulder?
Ooh.
Marcus. Detective Diaz. What a surprise.
I didn't expect you for another 9 1/2 minutes.
See?
Told you it was rude to be early.
Well, let's cancel the entire evening and try again next year.
[laughing] Hey.
She is hilarious.
I thought you might need some help setting up.
Oh, I'll put these in some water.
Thank you.
Marcus, you can help with the boeuf bourguignon.
I subbed shallots for onions in the mirepoix.
No! Are you kidding?
I have no idea what he's talking about.
I'm sorry. We're screwed.
I should just break up with him.
No, no, no, no. Santiago is always on time.
We only have to make small talk for...
8 minutes and 45 seconds.
We better keep it impersonal.
Acceptable topics include what constitutes a grain, the Hubble Space Telescope, orchid varietals, the birth of the transistor...
We only have to fill 8 minutes.
Sure, but think about it as 480 seconds, and you'll see why I'm concerned.
Oh, my God.
Uh-oh, Amy.
Train's moving real slow.
We're gonna be epically late.
Keep your reaction short and to the point.
I'm running out of mem.
Sorry, Gina.
I hope we're late.
That's how the fashionable crowd lives.
I told you... tonight, I'm gonna have fun.
What?
I'm being chill.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because something stinks, and it's definitely the food you brought.
I think it smells great.
It's my mom's famous nicoise salad.
Amy, all your cooking stinks.
Why would you even get involved with tuna and egg?
No one else seems to mind it.
We mind!
We really, really mind.
Just throw it out.
I will not throw it out, but I will open a window because I'm a nice person.
And I'm an even nicer person!
Bye-bye, salad!
No!
[suspenseful music]
Yo! Still no movement.
How was the snack machine?
Ah. Snacks abound!
Told you this place was awesome.
My theory is that Olson and his brother have been using it as a home base while they rob places up and down the coast.
Fascinating. Fascinating.
Do you desire a crispened potato?
Ah, don't mind if I dooble.
Wait a minute. ""Crispened potato.""
Why are you fancy-talking?
How dare you, sir?
I speak the common tongue.
There it is again.
You only do that when you're lying or hiding something.
Hiding? Ha!
Pish-posh!

Terry: Housekeeping!
That's not housekeeping! That's betrayal!
I can't believe you called the sarge!
Hey, Sarge.
Don't ""Hey, Sarge,"" me, Peralta!
I'm about to break the rest of your damn body!
Okay. Fine.
I accept my fate.
Just take a picture of my pen1s first, for posterity, and then do what you must.
Amy says that we should start dinner without her.
Then she writes, ""Whatevs,"" colon, hyphen, closed parenthesis.
Marcus: Great.
It's much nicer just the four of us.
I mean, we can really get into it.
Yeah, let's do just that.
So Marcus, what orchids can you name?
Oh, that's easy.
None.
Uh, well, here are the orchids that I can name.
Beclardia, Beloglottis, Benthamia, Diphylax, Dipodium, Evotella...
Raymond, you know how much I love hearing you talk about orchids...
Great. Then there's Eriaxis...
But I would love to hear more about our guest.
Rosa, tell us about your family.
I have one.
[Marcus laughs]
You got to give him more deets than that.
Her father's a teacher.
They're from Bensonhurst.
Speaking of which, have they finished repairing the Hubble Space Telescope?
Yes. Six years ago.
So do you have siblings?
I have... two sisters.
I have to leave this.
[clears throat]
Phew! Great idea.
Take a breather.
That was way too personal.
No one needs to know you have sisters.
New topic: The moons of Jupiter.
I think I might be pregnant.
Oh.
Oh...
Oh, n...
No.
I came down here to stop you from doing something stupid.
I called the ACPD and told them we had a possible perp at this motel.
They're sending a squad car.
Wow, Boyle.
The fact that you would sell me out after I brought you to Atlantic City on a half-expenses-paid, best-friend trip.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just... I was worried about you getting hurt.
No, Charles! Don't apologize!
We're mad at him!
I had to miss family dinner to drive my ass out here.
Well, no one asked you to do that.
Actually, I did. Remember?
I betrayed you.
Charles, what are you doing, bud?
I just dug you out of this.
Peralta, we're going home as soon as that squad car gets here.
Until then, you sit tight.
You're on time out.
That's your time-out chair.
Fine, but first, I have to go to the bathroom.
And it will be work, due to my injured tailbone and bruised bladder.

What the hell are you doing out there, Peralta?
Would you believe that my urine stream was so powerful that it...
No!
Okay.
I thought I saw our perp, and I know I'm not supposed to be working, but technically, I wasn't working because it wasn't our guy.
Get out of the bathroom!
[whispering] Yeah.
We're gonna go sit on those gross beds and talk about the fact that you have a real problem!
Okay, I get that you're mad, and we are definitely gonna talk, but I still haven't, technically, gotten to go pee, so if you wouldn't mind...
I don't care.
You have lost the right to pee.
You can fidget, little man.
[scoffs]
Well, it's gonna be on you when we're all covered in my whiz.
Get your ass out there.
Are your bosoms tender?
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
Are your senses heightened?
I think I might be pregnant, not bitten by a radioactive spider.
[sighs]
Kevin asked me about my sister.
She just told me she's pregnant, and that made me think...
I've been feeling run down lately, my stomach's been weird, and I just did the math in my head and I think I'm a little bit late.
Late to...
Oh, right. Right.
Your...
What if I'm pregnant?
Do I tell Marcus?
What do I do with a baby?
How do you take care of those things?
Why are their heads so soft?
Before you spiral any more, you should take a pregnancy test.
Yes. Smart. Immediately.
Oh.
Immediately immediately.
Very well.
I'll figure out a way to get you out of here without arousing suspicion.
Now I'm regretting blowing through my orchid material so quickly.
Jake, you put work ahead of everything else, and it's not healthy.
Remember Cagney and Lacey's third birthday party?
I hired you as Jakels the Clown.
How'd that go?
And Jeremy the giraffe has a very long neck!
That's it.
That little girl was strangled!
You were thinking that at a kid's party.
Life is more than just whatever case you're working on.
If you don't figure out how to balance things, you're gonna burn out or get hurt.
Oh, look.
You did get hurt.
Okay! Fine.
You guys make some great points, but counterpoint: I am right all the time.
There's our perp.
[suspenseful music]
All right. Let's go!
Jake!
Observe him from a safe distance while we wait for the Atlantic City PD to show up.
My exact instinct as well, Sarge.
Good thinking.
Oh, no.
Are you certain we have to cut the party short?
Yes; Unfortunately, Detective Diaz has an unexpected emergency to take care of.
All right.
Do you need to go as well?
No; It's not quite captain-worthy.
But still advanced enough that Detective Diaz's talents are best qualified to handle the...
Non-emergency emergency.
Yes. Precisely.
See? She's great.
I should go do that.
Now.
Yes.
Hey. What's up?
Hi.
Sorry we're so late.
Actually, the party is over.

The party is over!
Oh, I see. You heard me.
You were just taken by surprise.
Very well. Good night.

In retrospect, they were plenty.
Yes.
The worst part is, Olson got away.
That's the worst part?
You could've died, man.

My second year on the force, I was working a drug case, tracking this drug dealer for months.
Then, suddenly, he disappeared right before Memorial Day, which I was supposed to take off for a guys' weekend with some friends.
But how? We didn't know each other yet.
Oh. Other friends.
While I was gone, the dude resurfaced and got into a shootout with another drug dealer.
Two civilians got shot.
Meanwhile I was sipping piña coladas in Philly.
From that day on, I vowed to never take time off during a case.
Also, I don't love Philly.
Jake, I get it.
[sighs]
Philly sucks.
Yeah.
But why didn't you ever tell us?
I was embarrassed about the choice I made.
People got hurt because of me.
Perps get away. People get hurt.
That's part of the job.
But if you don't give yourself a break, you'll be no use to anyone.
Because you'll be dead.

Of course, it is a crater on Mars.

Okay, it's a private bar, not a haunted motel.
And no, I did not have a good time.
Turns out he didn't want to be best bros at all.
He just wanted to know if I was cool with him asking Amy out when the case ended.
I thought he was dating that weather girl.
No, he dumped her because she blamed Hurricane Sandy on gay marriage.
Anyways, now when the case ends, Amy is gonna marry Detective ""Blotter Dynamite.""
Why do you even care?
You still like her?
I don't know. I mean, we're friends.
And things have been kind of flirty lately.
Plus, we had this weird romantic moment thing-y at Charles and Gina's parents' wedding.
Ugh, just say you like her.
All right, fine, I still like her.
Look, I've been thinking about asking her out for the last couple of weeks, but it's hard.
There's so much buildup now, you know?
Not really. I don't ask people out.
I just tell them where we're going.
Great, well, it doesn't matter now anyway, 'cause I told Dave to go for it.
That was crazy stupid.
Sorry. That was normal stupid.
You should have told him to back off.
I can't go around telling guys not to ask Amy out because I like her and I'm too dumb to do anything about it.
I can't make a woman's choice for her.
I stand with Wendy. Did I do that right?
No.
Oh.
Look, If you want to give her a real choice, you've got to let her know that you an option.
I think you know what you've got to do.
Yeah.
Ask her out before the case ends, right?
I just want to be extra clear.
The stakes for me are through the roof for me on this one.
You wanted to see us?
What are these requisition forms?
We are throwing Terry a ""please stay"" party.
My vision is a frozen yogurt machine operated by Pam Grier.
Sir, we think Sarge is going to accept Copperhead's offer.
I never thought I'd say these words: You have to put Gina in touch with Pam Grier.
No, Sergeant Jeffords can make up his mind without the influence of Foxy Brown or cold yogurt.
He is a grown man.
Oh, I see what's going on here You're upset that Terry would even consider leaving the Nine-Nine.
I'd expect this pettiness from a spineless amoeba like Charles, but not you, Sir.
I'm not spineless.
Come on, Charles.
Yep.
Amy: Ahh, look who's finally here.
We already solved the case without you.
What? You did?
Kidding.
Oliver was actually giving us some pretty bad news.
Carry on, Oliver.
So we swabbed the whole van.
We didn't find anything.
No hairs, no fibers, no semen.
And a rental van is usually a frickin' Jackson Pollock.
All right.
They also wiped down the masks with some sort of bleach solution.
They were really covering their tracks.
Check it out.
Well, that wasn't very helpful.
Although, I did learn I should never rent a van again.



Hey, can I talk to you for a second privately?
Sure. Oh, wait.
This isn't gonna be that thing where you pretend you got an important text from Holt, and it's just that video of screaming sheep.
I promise you it's not, but I do stand by that prank.
So what's up?
Okay, I almost feel weird saying this, but I wanted to ask you... wow, those pictures are not helping.
Oh, my God.
They're really gonna have to re-grout.
Ugh, finding a contractor.
You are so consistent.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask you is...
Oliver: So I got the results on that feces.
It's human, but it's not all human.
You're not Dr. Gassner.
We are not.
Can you give us a sec?
Sure.
Real quick, what was the other...
Dog and bear.
Wow.
I thought you'd really be into that feces puzzle.
Normally, yes.
But I want to talk to you about something else right now.
More specifically...
Guys, dispatch called.
Great, Dave's here now.
The check-cashing babies just struck on Flatbush.
We've got to go.

What did you want to tell me?
Oh, Captain Holt sent a very important text.
Oh.

That's lavender. Terry loves lavender.
A little homemade honey yogurt infused with lavender and love.
Mmm, that is delicious.

I mean, technically it's from a sheep's breast.
Hey, Terry, got any new baby pics?
You hate looking at pictures of my twins.
You said since they were identical, I didn't need to take photos of both.
That doesn't sound like Auntie Gina.

Despite what I've been saying for years, that ass just might quit.
I don't get it.
There's no rhyme or reason to the locations they hit.
This place was so well-guarded.
And why not hit the one down the street that just has an old man out front?
It just seems so random.
Yeah, it's like... oh, that feels great.
I don't think it's random.

We'll crack it.
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

What?
Your s*x tape.
What? No.
Look, here's what I wanted to say.
Oh, no. I figured it out.
Huh?
Here, look.
The trash cans, the van, the jumpsuit, they all say ""Johnny's Janitorial.""
Not random.
They cased each location as cleaners.
No wonder the van was so spotless.
Dave: Hey, what did I miss?
Jake just solved the case.
Holy crap. That's awesome.
[laughs]
All right.
I mean, but, you know, it's not totally done yet.
You know, still a long way to go.
Tons of paperwork, and a case is never truly done until the trial is complete and the sentence is served completely to its fruition in prison.
Jake, just celebrate.
Okay.
Wow.
Rosa: Why the long face?
That Mexican candy giving you nerve damage again?
Probably, but who even cares?
Why did I solve the case?
Why couldn't I have just let those guys continue to terrorize Brooklyn until I built up the nerve to ask out a girl?
You're a good cop.
Do not beat yourself up about that.
I'm not a good cop. I'm an amazing cop.
And I'll never forgive myself.
The case is over, Amy and Majors are on their way to The Keychain right now.
It's too late.

You left your cell phone on your desk, and I assumed you were dead.
Mm, I would clearly be buried with my phone.
Sir, these guys already digitized all my files for me.
Isn't that amazing?
What?
Why did you snatch up Sergeant Jeffords' task?
Because we're trying to get him to stay.
Well, that's not your job.
Jeffords, you can stay here and digitize 2000 through 2005 inclusive.
I expect it done by the morning.

Because I'm prepared to light Charles on fire in protest.

So you're done trying to push him out, Yoko?
Terry: Whoa, don't give Captain Holt a hard time.

I don't know what you're talking about.
You're an adult, and you came to your own decision.
Look at me. I can't keep a straight face.

Yeah, you did.
Digitizing those old files reminded me of all the cases I worked and all the good we do in community.
What's best for my family is that they grow up with a dad who's proud of what he does.
Thank you, Captain.
Look at you.
You're like the wise old owl from those lollipop commercials.
Terry's back!
[cheers and applause]
Dave: Hey, buddy, sorry I'm late.
I had to get this dumb medal from the commissioner for a double-murder I solved last year.
Been there.
I had a pretty crazy morning myself.
Jake, your taquitos exploded in the toaster oven.
Thanks, Rosa. 10-4. Copy that.
So how did it go with Santiago?
Actually, she wasn't into it.
Swing and a miss.
You're kidding.
Yeah, it was really weird.
I've never been turned down before, so unexpected.
I'm excited to see what happens to me next.
Okay.
So... Blotter Dynamite struck out, huh?
I know, but why?
What does it mean, and why did she double tuck?
And how come she turned him down?
Do you think it has something to do with me?
Rosa, what is she thinking?
Jake.
Yeah, I should ask her myself.
Hey, you just missed Majors.
I've got to say, he was looking a little bit rough, almost like he was up all night crying or something.
Ha-ha, Jake.
I'm sure he's fine.
So... what happened?
Well, I thought we were getting a drink to celebrate closing the case.
But apparently, he thought it was a date.
Right, and you were not into that, because he's so muscular and in command of his finances?
He's great, but after everything that happened with Teddy and all the cops I know who go out and break up and then still have to work together, it's just too messy.
I've got a new rule: I don't date cops.
Cool. Cool.
Yeah, actually, that's funny. I have the same rule.
No more cops.
From this point on, it's strictly dating criminals.
If you break up with them, you can always send them to jail forever.
Exactly, nice and clean.
Mm-hmm.
So...
Hey, I got an email from the commissioner's office about our case.
What did they say?
[sheep bleating]
Ahh! Ahh. Ah-ha.
You got me with my thing.
Mm-hmm.
Great.
Oh!

♪ ♪
Ladies and gentlemen, today is the greatest day of my life.
Guess who just got murdered!
That's right... it's Carl Mather.
[gasps dramatically]
What? I'm the only one gasping?
Guys, Carl Mather? Did 25 years in Attica...
[gasps dramatically]
Sor... sorry.
Just point at me when you want me to gasp.
Will do.
Mather is part of the Fulton Street Four.
Amy: Oh!
They stole $21 million from an armored car depot.
Feds caught them but they never found the money.
Until now.
You found $21 million?
Oh, God no. Not yet.
I can see how that would be confusing though.
I'm sorry. But I'm going to.
Over the past six months, all four of these guys have been released, and now one of them shows up dead.
Someone's after that money, and they're willing to kill for it.
[gasps dramatically]
Holt: You're getting ahead of yourself.
You don't know that Mather's death is connected to the money yet.
Don't turn this into something bigger than it is, not with Madeline Wuntch watching us at all times.
Ew. When'd they put that in?
Holt: Right after Wuntch got promoted.
She had it installed at that height so she'd, I quote, ""always be looking down at me,"" unquote.
Treat this like a regular case.
Sir, with all due respect, this is an epic case.
It's the reason I became a cop.
I mean, hunting down a murderer, recovering millions in stolen money, rappelling out of a chopper with a knife between my teeth.
Why would you jump out of a helicopter with a knife in your mouth?
It's called a chopper, and the knife is in my mouth because both of my hands are holding giant machine guns.
And that's how it's going down.
Okay, reminder, tomorrow we are hosting a field trip for the Brooklyn Park Magnet School.
Sorry, Sarge, I can't be around magnets.
Pacemaker.
I'm actually not gonna correct you on that.
Guys, I really need this to go well.
My girls are on the wait list for their preschool and it's twice as tough to get in with twins.
Why don't you just get one of them in and then let them take turns going to school every other day?
Diaz, that's crazy.
I asked my wife and she said no.
This field trip has to go well.
This is my chance to impress the principal.
Sarge, you're in luck.
I went to a magnet school where I was voted ""most likely to befriend a school administrator.""
Oh, Amy.
Preteens are my people.
I speak their language.
They are gonna have an amazing time.
Thanks, guys. That's great.
If you want, I can show them some of the cool stuff we have in the evidence locker.
I'm pretty sure there's a bag of hands in there.
Whoa! No. No.
We got to make this place kid-friendly.
No crime scene photos lying about.
That's not a crime scene.
That's a boudoir photo I'm having framed for my wife.
That's me underneath the mask.
Oh, God!
[police radio mumbling]
Jake: Next, let's get statements from the neighbors.
Ah, hello, Captain.
Quick update: Another one of the Fulton Street Four was murdered here this morning.
Huh, I'm surprised you're not celebrating inappropriately.
This is a crime scene and I'm a professional.
You did it before I showed up?
Yeah, that is exactly correct.
So two of these guys murdered in the past two days?
It has to be tied to the missing money.
Admit I was right.
Circumstances do suggest a connection.
Admit it with more gusto.
You were right.
Yes! Did you get it, Boyle?
Oh, the camera was in selfie mode, but I look super proud of you.
Unfortunately, because this case has turned out to be important, that she-skunk Madeline Wuntch has her hindquarters pointed right at it.
She wants to see us in her office, no doubt to give the case to Major Crimes.
No, no, no. We can't let that happen.
Sir, we have to do something.
Fine. I'll seduce her.
I'll just put on my bike shorts and give her a glimpse of the quad cities.
No. No. That's not what I meant.
I meant we have to fight her.
We're not gonna fight her. She's the devil.
And you don't dance with the devil, because you get burned.
Also, because in Madeline's case, she has no rhythm and her hands are like little rat claws.
If she wants the case, it's hers.
For the record, you're turning this murder scene into a real bummer-scape.
Tell me you got that zinger.
Oh, the camera was in selfie mode again, but I was really laughing hard.
Okay.
Okay, kids, this is where my detective squad solves crimes.
Wow.
This is my desk.
You can tell by the framed 200-piece puzzle my three-year-olds put together on their own.
That's very advanced, Sergeant Jeffords.
Is it? I wouldn't know what milestones are impressive to a school admissions officer.
They can count to 20 in English and Mandarin.
Hi. Detective Santiago, magnet school alumna.
Well, I appreciate that you used the proper declension of alumnus.
Well, some say Latin is a dead language, but I say it's just taking a long nap.

Gina: Okay, you two are obviously the alphas.
Let me guess.
You're dating the blond kid and you like Filipino Bieber but you're worried he's still into Little Miss Side Braid Janky Purse.
How did you know?
[chuckles] I know so much.
Hi, I'm Gina.
[chuckles] Hey.
[clears throat]
Hello, Raymond.
How do you like my new office? 20th floor.
Yes, I never thought I'd see you this high without a broom under you.
Enough niceties. Have a seat.
Thanks, but I'm actually fine standing.
I could stay in these bad boys all day.
So two members of the Fulton Street Four have been murdered... sounds like a big case.
No, it's actually the opposite.
Pretty much an NBT sitch.
No big thang.
The word is ""thing,"" and the thing is big.
We believe someone is after the missing $21 million, and solving this murder could lead us to the money.
Sure, but that money's, like, 25 years old.
It's probably not even good anymore.
[grunts] Sorry. Cramped up.
This is a very important case, Raymond, to me, and to the city of New York.
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine has the resources to deal with something of this magnitude.
I understand the politics.
This is a high-profile case.
Do what you must.
What I was going to say is, since you don't have the resources, I'll give you anything you need.
The case is yours. You have my full support.
What?
He meant that more excited. Like, ""What!""
Okay, two of the Fulton Street Four are dead.
My hunch... one of them is killing off his co-scums so he can keep the money for his scum-self.
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.
He listed a Brooklyn address with his parole officer.
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.
Unless he's innocent... then we're gonna save the son of a bitch.
Either way, this case is gonna be awesome.
Peralta, I'm putting myself on this investigation with you.
What? Why?
Wuntch is up to something.
There's only one reason why she would let us keep this case.
She took one look at me and said, ""That's the guy I want flying my chopper.""
You know how to fly a chopper?
How hard could it be?
It's just a big fan that goes in the sky.
She let us keep this case because she wants us to fail.
I'm coming along so that you don't waste time and resources turning this investigation into another Ron McClane movie.
Oh, you know it's John McClane.
I've made my decision. End of discussion.
All right, fine.
But you're gonna have to take your own car.
I signed out that drug dealer's Lamborghini from the impound.
It only has two seats.
I saw that you had made that request.
I changed it to a sensible sedan.
Okay, but the sunroof stays open.
There is no sunroof.
Why did you even become a cop?
Oh, great job, kids.
Don't solve too many crimes and put me out of business.
Terry's got to pay the rent. [laughs]
Dr. Susman wants a private chat with me.
Thanks for warming her up, Santiago.
They didn't give eighth grade Amy the key to the teacher's lounge just for nothing.
I stocked their fridge and cleaned up after them.
Great. So can you take over with the kids for a minute?
They're done with this activity.
Of course. I am amazing with kids.
[laughs nervously] Okay.
I am terrible with kids.
I haven't listened to rap music in three years.
I don't know the lingo. You have to do this.
I can't... McKenzie is in the bathroom right now freaking out because Kelsey S. Made out with Hayes even though she knows Brianna's into him.
So unless you want the spring dance to be a total drama fest, I have to be there for her.
Honestly, you should show them a picture of a dead body.
No! Rosa, Terry said to keep it kid-friendly.
Okay, I'll just show them the stuff that I was into when I was their age.
I'm done.
What do we do now?
What's next?
Hello, friends.
Who here would like to see a presentation about crime statistics as a function of demographics and time?
Who wants to see a picture of a dead body?
all: Me!
Bludsoe lives at the end of his hall.
Hmm... I would have preferred an abandoned lighthouse or a dilapidated barn, but I can embellish in my memoirs.
Oh, I can't wait to read that book.
What are you gonna call it?
[in gravelly voice] ""Go Ahead, Jake My Day.""
No, yours is much better.
""Case Closed, Jake Open.""
Wow.
I know.
I said yours was better.
Whatever. Let's just do this.
[pounding]
NYPD. Open up.
[clock clicking open]
Hey, check it out.
Jake: Half-packed suitcase.
Looks like Bludsoe was planning a trip until he got interrupted by someone.
Or something.
Like what?
I don't know... I just thought it would help the intrigue.
It did.
That's enough chitchat already.
Come on, how many people have to get killed before you start having fun?
You do know it's our job to stop the killing, right?
Wait a second. [sniffs]
I think I smell a dead body.
[sniffs]
[clears throat] Nope. My mistake.
Wait! Don't close that.
Jake: Look. Handprint.
That's a fake wall.
NYPD.
Come out with your hands on your head.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
He's trying to kill me.
So I guess, if I had to sum them up, Cagney is the intellectual one, whereas Lacey is more of your traditional prodigy.
Well, your daughters sound great.
You know, I'm gonna look over their applications again.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.
It's Jeffords with two Fs.
But what really matters is that your students have an amazing experience here today.
They are.
Look, Rosa. Sarge is here.
Oh, my God.
[shrieking horror music]
Children, get out of this room immediately.
Dr. Susman: Let's go.
whispering angrily: What the hell, guys?
They're 12 years old.
I would've killed to have seen a bag of hands at that age.
I'm so sorry... I tired to be myself and they hated it.



Where were you?
Saving the day.
Hayes is out of the picture.
The McKenzie/Kelsey S. beef is squashed, and Brianna's going to the dance with Aidan, who's a much better match for her anyway, BT-dubs.
How does any of that help me?
Dr. Susman...
Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.
I think this experience has been more than enough for the children.
We're done here.
I was walking home from the coffee shop.
I have a job bussing tables there.
Anyway, the next thing I know, Mikey D has a gun in my back.
Michael D'Angelo, the other member of the Fulton Street Four.
Yes, believe it or not, I familiarized myself with the names of all two suspects in this high-profile homicide we're investigating.
I fought him off, but he got my key.
What's the key for?
Each of us had one, and you needed all four to open the safe.
And what's in the safe?
The $21 million.
Bing... pot...
Nope... I was gonna say bingo, but then I was like, ""Jackpot's better,"" but then it was too late; I was halfway through the word.
Bingpot works. It's taking off.
It's taking off.
Captain, D'Angelo has a place upstate.
The local sheriff says there's a car in the driveway right now.
He must be there.
Okay, they're gonna have to raid the place without us.
It'll take us two hours to get up there.
Or we could take...
We are not taking a helicopter.
You know I was gonna say chopper.
Look, Peralta, I know you're having fun, but a helicopter is exactly the kind of wasteful expenditure that Wuntch will use to bury me if something goes wrong.
Okay, sir...
Or...
It's the kind of thing she'll crucify me for not getting.
""You could've had a chopper, Raymond.
""Why didn't you take advantage?
Just a minute... my cauldron's boiling over.""
Yeah, but what she actually said was, [in Boston accent] ""Chopper's yours, Peralta.""
Your impression was better.
What did you do?
She may have called me and I may have briefed her and she may have said yes to the chopper because it's definitely on its way right now!
I call middle seat!
Jake: Whoo!
This is awesome!
Okay, just so we're clear, from this point forward, my call sign will be Death Blade.
And I'll be Rum Tum Tugger.
No, Boyle. No characters from Cats.
Dig deep. Think of something scary.
Adolf Hitler.
No!
You will be... Sidewinder.
All right, but I'm more scared of Hitler.
How about you, Captain? What's your call sign?
I will be Captain Raymond Holt.
Uh-huh, I knew you wouldn't play ball.
And that is why your call sign is Wet Blanket.
Sidewinder, this is Death Blade.
Do you copy, Sidewinder? Over.
This is Sidewinder, Death Blade.
I read you loud and clear. Over.
Do you have a 20 on Wet Blanket, Sidewinder?
Over.
I do have a visual...
Over.
All right, look, Captain, Wuntch said that we could have anything we needed to solve this case.
Yes, but why?
To catch a murderer who stole $21 million.
No, it's so that when we do fail, it'll be that much more spectacular.
If we don't get D'Angelo, my career is over.
But if we do catch him, your career will really take off.
Chopper pun!
Dr. Susman, I am so, so sorry.
Please don't hold this against my daughters.
I would never do that.
Preschool admissions are based on what we think of the parents.
Oh, no.
Dr. Susman...
Nancy, if I may...
You may not.
Okay.
Look, our methods may have been a little unorthodox, and perhaps a little...
Graphic and disgusting.
I was gonna go with yucky...
But these kids had fun today.
And they learned a lot.
Tricia, what's Luminol?
It's used to look for blood in a crime scene.
Even if a criminal tried to clean it up, the iron in blood makes the chemical glow.
And, Bobby, what's enucleation?
It's when someone pops your eyeball out.
Probably should've used a less gross example.
The point is, this is exactly the kind of educational experience I loved about my magnet school.
Well, there's something to be said for that.
Also, and more importantly, I got McKenzie and Brianna to stop hating on Kelsey S.
And now they're best friends... you're welcome.
Wow, that's actually impressive.
Thank you.
Terry: So, Dr. Susman, let's just call this field trip what it was... a huge success.
It was... interesting.
Bobby: I saw a prostitute.
Not helping, kid.

Come in and shut the door.
I have some news, which you must promise to keep secret.
Madeline Wuntch is making me head of public relations for the NYPD.
I'm being forced out of the Nine-Nine.
I don't wish to make a big deal of it, so please limit your reactions to one second; go.
What in the world?
Are you kidding?
That's plenty.
You can't leave us.
I'm not going anywhere.
Madeline's not some invincible succubus.
She's a regular succubus, and she can be defeated.
We just need to find the letter.
What letter?
Before our current police commissioner was hired, a mutual friend told me Madeline wrote a letter to the mayor telling him it was a mistake.
She apparently called her now-boss a ""simpering buffoon"".
Amateur; always say your insults to someone's face.
No paper trail.
A copy of that letter exists in the mayor's archives.
I can't go snooping around without alerting Madeline, so it won't be easy, and we don't have much time, but I need you to find that letter.
Are you with me?
Oh, hell yeah.
I'm turning my phone into airplane mode.
Terry: Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes.
Charles: Rosa, I know you don't like anyone wishing you a happy birthday, so crappy day to you.
Still too much.
Charles: I assume you're not doing anything to celebrate tonight.
Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.
Charles: So since you're free, I need your help moving this old Ms. Pac-Man machine I just bought.
Why are you so obsessed with that game?
Because it's the sexiest video game ever.
She's insatiable, Rosa.
Insatiable. Insatiab...
Stop saying ""insatiable.""
Anyway, I bought this old machine from a bar, and I was hoping you'd help me move it.
You want me to go to a bar?
Mm-hmm.
You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party.
Did Marcus put you up to this?
What? No, that's crazy talking.
We just need to be there at exactly 9:45 p.m. and not a minute earlier.
Also, there's a particular door I want us to enter through.
Amy: Why is he getting out here?
I thought your C.I. said the drop was happening in a park.
Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.
Amy: Augustine has the laptop with him.
We should just arrest him right here.
No, the buyer's the bigger collar.
We've got to follow him in and wait for the handoff.
Okay, if you're going in, I've heard this place has an amazing bone marrow custard.
[laughs] Not that I've ever had a bad one.
No. All right, let's go.
No, wait, we look like cops.
We're never gonna blend in dressed like this.
Okay, there, how's that?
Uh, I don't know.
All I see is clothes hanging off of a genderless blob.
Rosa: You look fine. Here, wear this.
Jake, you need a jacket or something.
Well, Scully left his sports coat back there.
Oh, but it will never fit Jake's athletic body.
Unless...
No, I don't want to do that.
You have to.
I'm not gonna do it.
You're doing it.
What? What do you have to do?
Don Johnson it.
Don Johnson it!

♪ ♪
I look like an idiot.
I didn't even have time to lotion my forearms.
It's so weird wearing Rosa's jacket.
There's a piece of barbed wire in the pocket.
Cool.
All right, do you have a visual on... the hostess stand?
Hi. Table for two, please.
I'm so sorry. There's nothing available.
We're totally booked up.
Oh, no, that's horrible.
Tonight's a really important night for us.
Johnny and I just got engaged, and this is where our first date was.
Oh, yeah, it would mean so much to Dora and me.
I would have made a reservation, but I didn't know if she was gonna say yes, so...
Oh, I love how nervous you were, you little goose.
woman: You are just so sweet together.
You know, I'm sure I can find room for two young lovers.
Jake: Yeah, we are lovers... together... in beds.
Okay.
Thank you so much for waiting.
Your table is almost ready.
Great.
Sorry about springing the engagement and romantic stuff on you.
No, no, no. That was great.
I mean, it's what got us in here.
Cheek kiss was a bit much. Very wet.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Dora's sloppy.
woman: Okay, and if you'll just follow me.
Jake: Well, the honeymoon's over, Dora.
We're back to being Jake and Amy, two normal cops working a job.
All right, there you go.
Jake: Thanks.
woman: You're the couple that just got engaged.
That's us, Johnny and Dora, a couple for sure.
Okay, according to my sources in the assistant community, the letter is right here in the fourth-floor archives, cabinet J-13.
Nice job. What's the plan?
You sneak in and get the letter.
I'll distract the file clerk.
Apparently, he's very into bird watching, so talking to a woman should blow his mind.
And talking to this woman, it could kill him.
Here, can you look at this map of a park and tell me where them hot birds hang out?
Well, you're gonna want to, uh, avoid the, uh, great lawn, because it's basically just grackles.
Ugh, grackles?
Yeah.
Gina: I hate grackles.
They're the worst.
Well, a lot of people think grackles are just a common bird up here, but you know what?
On the West Coast they don't get grackles.
Can you give some more info for a novice bird watcher such as myself?
You have got to know the difference between your water birds.
I mean, so many people don't know the difference between an anhinga and a snake bird and a swamp hawk.
A lot of people don't know they're all the same bird.
Are those the ones that sound like Rihanna kind of when they sing?
I'm not familiar with who that is.
They're like, ""Eh, eh.""
That sounds like that might be a crested woodpecker.
Or is it more like... [whistles]
Well, that's a crested titmouse maybe?
Oh, my God, that's it.
Wayne, you are a damn treasure trove.
We got the letter.
Well done.
Now get me Madeline and a bucket of water.
It's time to melt a witch.
Rosa: Who else is going?
Rosa, listen to me, there is no party.
Just get off my doughnut already.
Don't lie to me, Boyle, or you will be eating your bone marrow custard through a straw.
That's exactly how you're supposed to eat bone marrow...
Charles!
Ah!
All right, there's a party.
I can't give you details.
All I can say is I know you, and I know you'll have a good time.
If you knew me, you'd know I hate surprise parties, so clearly you don't know me at all.
What? We're friends.
I was building up to calling you ""Ro-ro"" one of these days.
That will never happen.
In fact, you just lost ""Rosa"" privileges.
From now on, you can call me ""Diaz"" or ""Hey, you.""
Come on, Rosa.
Come on, hey, you.



Wow, champagne and oysters.
You really shouldn't have, guys.
Well, it's a special night.
So when did you guys meet?
Last year.
Five years ago.
We first met five years ago, but we don't count it, because...
I was dating a speedboat model at the time.
And I was dating a super handsome comptroller of a major U.S. city.
Anyways, about a year ago, we bumped into each other at a bar, and we haven't been able to keep our hands off each other since.
Mm.
So how did you know she was the one?
I'd love to answer that.
Um, you know, just whenever I look at her face and the attached physique.
And you?
Uh...
He makes me laugh.
And, you know, there's really no one else's opinion who I care about more than hers, so...
woman: Okay, so enough chitchat Let's see the ring.
I don't have it on me.
She has gigantic fingers.
What I mean to say is that the ring I got would never have fit on her fingers, because they are that of a giant, behemoth person.
[laughter]
Madeline, thank you for coming.
Raymond, always a pleasure to call on a vanquished foe.
I feel like Jackie Joyner-Kersee congratulating one of the other slower runners.
Terry: Buckle up.
It's gonna be a hell of a ride.
Ray: Care to sit?
I'm sure you'd like to take some weight off your cloven hooves.
Calling me the devil?
How original, Raymond.
Actually I was calling you a goat, you goat.
both: Oh.
I'd like to talk about my promotion.
Very well, but first, how do I know you're not wearing a wire?
I need to pat you down.
If you must.
Terry: What is going on?
Shh. I'm watching something.
man: Can you get the car from the valet, babe?
I'm gonna in the back and say hi to the chef.
Good luck on your wedding, guys.
Oh, have fun on your honeymoon.
We will. We're going to Waco, Texas.
Huh. Okay, bye.
Bye.
Waco, Texas?
I don't know.
It was just on Dateline.
All right, well, Augustine took the laptop case with him.
He's gonna make the drop. Let's go.
Look, there's the buyer.
Or maybe he's just actually saying hi to the chef?
Why isn't he making the handoff?
Jake: Oh, crap, he saw us.
Uh,...
Excuse me.
Oh, hey.
We were just looking for a place to, uh...
Boink.
Yep. Boink.
That's my preferred term for it as well.
I get it.
Newly engaged kids. Enjoy.
Thanks.
Good. Good, good, good, good.
We kept our cover intact. Ce work.
Quick, professional thinking out there.
Very quick Very professional.
Detective.
Detective.
Let's get back on the case.
Yes.
So how was the restaurant?
Such a normal time!
Why are you being weird?
Amy and I kissed.
What?
To keep our cover from being blown; we didn't have a choice.
Tell me everything!
Jake: Charles, it was just a kiss, okay?
It was for work. It was nothing.
Yeah, who cares about a kiss?
Call me if you grab each other's asses.
He's pulling over. It's going down.
Charles: You guys are so naive.
It's never nothing.
In high school, I played Daddy Warbucks in Annie,
Becca Murse played Annie, and we were supposed to hug onstage.
And at first, that seemed like nothing too, but by opening night, we were full-on making out.
As Daddy Warbucks and Annie?
Mm-hmm.
The audience was not on board.
Playwright sued the school.
Rosa: Guys, guys, it's not a handoff.
He's leaving the package.
Okay, you and Rosa follow Augustine.
Right, and you and Amy follow your hearts.
No, we're gonna stay with the package.
And each other forever.
Come on, man!
So here's how I see this going down.
You plead for your job back. I refuse.
You start weeping like a war widow.
Does that sound about right?
Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeline.
How did you get this?
Gina: Gina and Terry got it, you grackle.
Ray: It doesn't matter how I got it.
Sorry, sir, didn't realize that was how you wanted to play it.
I see you've got an audience for this little stunt?
Yes, well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile?
Now, Madeline, before one of us starts weeping like a war widow, would you like to give me my precinct back?
It's not that simple; I can't just reverse your promotion.
You have until tomorrow, you grackle.
Rosa: We can't pull him over this close to the drop site.
It'll alert the buyer. I say we follow him for a mile.
Copy that.
How's your mom enjoying the new phone you got her for her birthday on March 16th?
Dude, stop saying random facts to try to prove you know me.
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm simply making small talk with my friend Rosa, who went skydiving once.
Enough!
I'm going to the dumb party but only because I don't want to hurt Marcus.
I'm still super mad at you.
Mm, like how you're still super mad at Gilmore Girls for how the finale went down?
Oh, I just want to see Lorelai happy, and shut up!
Ah, see? I knew you so well, I knew it was co... ah!
Hey, seriously, we're cool, right?
Yeah, totally.
We're fine.
Good.
Gosh, you know, I'm actually a little bit hungry.
I never ended up eating at that dumb fancy restaurant.
You know what I'm getting on my way home?
Yeah, you're gonna go to the Polish place and get perogies, potato pancakes, and a cup of hot chocolate.
That's exactly what I'm gonna get.
Yeah.
I will be having pizza, two slices of meat supreme from Tony's, served display temperature.
Meat supreme is a million red flags, and eating it cold is just insane.
No, no, no. It's not cold.
It's display temperature.
Jake.
There's a difference, Amy.
No, Jake, he's looking at us.
Well, this is happening.
Huh?
NYPD! Freeze! We are police colleagues!
You're under arrest. This is a work event.
Hey, can you sign this arrest report for Augustine and the buyer?
Sure.
Great.
Man, I forgot how long your signature takes.
I'm just gonna watch Braveheart on my phone real quick.
[laughs]
Given the circumstances, I could see how that might have seemed like flirty teasing or something, but I was legit being critical.
You have a problem.
No, even that sounded like banter now.
All right, there's only one way out of this for me.
I just got to get super cruel.
Prepare to have your physical flaws pointed out, Amy.
I'm talking about your tall butt and your weird elbows.
Jake, it's okay.
Thank you.
This whole night was really weird.
I know.
I just... ugh.
I want everything to go back how it was, you know?
It's so awkward.
Yeah.
And you're right.
We shouldn't date cops, 'cause we're a great team.
We work great together.
I don't want to mess that up.
Yeah, I don't want everything to change.
Yeah, me neither.
Okay, then that's that, Detective Peralta.
Detective Santiago.
See you around the precinct.
Yep.
Tall butt.
Okay, before we go in, remember you have to pretend to be surprised.
How's this? Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I imagined.
The energy was great, but the message was flawed.
All right, let's get this over with.
Surprise.
What's going on?
I rented this entire bar so you and I could celebrate with no people anywhere near us.
I probably should have hired a bartender, though.
I have no idea how to make drinks.
This is incredible.
It was all Charles' idea.
I told you I knew you, Ro-ro.
Thank you.
But never call me ""Ro-ro"" again.
Oh, but I will.
I've earned this.
Happy b-day, Ro-ro.
Whoo!
Welcome, Madeline. Have you thought things over?
I have, but first, how do I know you're not wearing a wire?
So I've thought it over, and perhaps you should go ahead and show that letter to the commissioner.
And let him fire you?
I'll deny I wrote it.
It will take months to authenticate, which will give me plenty of time to make some personnel changes around here.
There's an opening for a detective down in Brighton Beach.
I think I'll transfer Diaz there.
Detective Boyle I'll send to Long lsland City.
Santiago will be a great fit for Pelham Bay.
And Peralta, your little pet project, I'm gonna ship him off to Staten lsland.
Hope he likes breaking up tanning salon fistfights.
Looks like you've got a decision to make, Raymond.
What are you gonna do?
Ray: Squad, if I could have your attention please?
I am being transferred to the public relations office.
I'm leaving the Nine-Nine effective immediately.
What the hell?
I don't understand.
What the hell?
Why are you doing this?
What the hell?
I want to say it has been a pleasure to have worked alongside all of you for the past 21 1/2 months.
I'm sorry for getting so emotional.
A pretty consistent tone, actually.
These have been the... these have been the best years of my career.
Oh, no. This is new.
And I know that everyone of you gave me everything you had, and I will never forget it.
Go back to being robot captain.
[laughs] Meep-morp.
Zeet.
[clears throat] Dismissed.
Sir!
I'm coming with you.
Thank you, Gina.
I'm also coming.
Not necessary.
Hey.
Hey.
Thought I might find you in here.
I just needed to process the captain's news.
I feel so bad for him.
So how are you holding up?
I don't know. I'm still in shock.
You?
Um, basically handling it the way I dealt with my dad leaving, just repressing the hell out of it.
So a lot of change around here, huh?
man: Hey, Jake, the new captain's here.
Who do you think it's gonna be?
Terry: I have no idea.
I bet it's me.
I just hope I'm ready.
Rosa: Wow.
Come on, guys.
I know you're sad, but let's do our best to make a good first impression here.
Smart. Good call.

Boom, I've already established my authority through my amazing sense of humor.

Totally. Yeah.
So how do we keep it light and breezy?
I know. A comprehensive set of rules.
How am I attracted to you?
Doesn't matter. I am. Go.

Hello, Raymond.
You're looking old and sickly.
So nice of you to greet us, Madeline.
I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.
Sticks and stones, Raymond.
Describing your breakfast?
I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit.
I'll turn this place around just like I did the Nine-Nine.
I doubt that.
Everyone, this is your new commanding officer, Raymond Holt.
He's going to be with you for a long, long time.
Thank you, Chief Wuntch.
I'm excited to be back.
I look forward to doing meaningful work beginning with my eight-point plan for community engagement.
Wonderful.
But no new initiatives until you finish the meaningful work that's already in progress here.
Could be a while, Raymond.
They're trying to come up with a name for the NYPD's new pigeon mascot.
Oh, no.
What? Naming a pigeon?
How long could that possibly take?
They've been at it for months.
[chuckles] I love my life.
[laughs]
Holy Moses, he's alive.
So I want to explain what happened back there.
I did not have a heart attack.
The doctors have informed me that I have a genetic heart condition.
My aortic valve is 16% too narrow, which lowers my life expectancy from 103 to 64.
So sorry, sir. That's terrible.
Yes, it's depressing.
They also informed me that I carry the gene for webbed feet, which is interesting, more than anything else.
But, uh, when you stare death in the face, as I have, it really puts things into perspective, namely that I've been wasting too much of my time farting around!
So that stops now!
Say good-bye to the fun, hilarious, laid-back Seth Dozerman that you used to love.
Boys, hand 'em out!
What the hell are these?
""What the hell are these?""
These are Dozer-pads.
Each one is equipped with a GPS system and a countdown clock to remind you to complete a task every 55 minutes.

What happens when the clock runs out?

Dozerman: Failure. Failure.
You are behind schedule!
Oh, that's fun.
Yeah.
Your 55 minutes starts right... now.
Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long.
I'm not a toddler. This is stupid.
I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that ""stupid"" is a no-no word.

Fine, but I am gonna play the hell out of some backgammon.

Are you going on a date with Amy?
What? No. Why?
Uh, because you guys just kissed on that mission.
Charles, we just kissed 'cause we were undercover.
That's it.
Yeah, it didn't mean anything.
Not that it's any of your business, Boyle, but the person that I'm taking on a date is a girl from the gym.
What?
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about her?
Or that you go to the gym?
Jake, avoid the weights.
Nobody wants you turning into another Terry.
Ugh.
Hey, people like the way that I look.
Sure they do, big guy.
Look, I can't believe you're gonna take some fitness floozy to Bouche Manger.
You should be going with Amy.
Right, Amy?
Uh... [scoffs]
Whatever, dog.
Date the flooze.
See?
It's never gonna happen, Boyle, okay?
Because I find Amy repulsive, and she finds me extremely handsome.
So stop pressuring us.
Oh, you sweet, naive boy.
I haven't even begun to pressure you two.
I've already written my best man speech for your wedding.
Oh, I'm gonna need you to get married on a farm.

So here we are, officially on a date, romantical date.
Yes, we are.
No longer just colleagues.

Yes, great idea.
Pardon me, ma'am.
Could you please bring us four kamikaze shots?
And four for me as well.
Ah, I like your style.

So we broke a rule.
Yeah.

We are not leaving these seats until you give me some deets.
All right, fine.
It started off a bit rocky, but it ended up being really fun.
Did you kiss?
Did you french?
Boyle, I'm not gonna answer that.
And no one over the age of 12 says ""french.""
Oh, that's a yes. Oh, my God, you had s*x.
[grunts]
I can tell because you're glowing.
Ugh, Jake, no one wants to hear about your s*x life.
You just asked me repeatedly.
Because I was rooting for you and Amy, but now I can see you're super serious about this anonymous gym seductress.
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm... I would never date Jake.
I work with Jake.
I'd love to see you date someone from work.
Your head would explode.
Your head would explode... because of how well I would handle it.
Mm. Sick burn.
Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you.
Captain, everything all right?
[tapping]
You tell me.
According to your Dozer-pad, four of your coworkers have been gathered around your desk for the last 90 seconds.
Also, someone named Norm Scully has been in the bathroom for the last 72 minutes.
Oh, yeah, that means he's about halfway.
But in regards to the coworkers, sir, I was telling them I wanted to get more work done, but all they wanted to do was talk about my dating life, knowing full well that my true love is efficiency.
You know my motto, sir.
Cho's before hos.
""Cho's"" is ""chores.""
What?
I like you.
I could tell from the moment I walked in here that we were one and the same... detail-oriented, love crunching numbers.
Bet your apartment's immaculate.
Could probably eat off the floor.
And I do. Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna handle this for you.
Okay.
I'm gonna send out a Dozerblast.
Hey, everyone stop talking about Peralta's personal life.
Dozerblast over.
Well, thank you very much, sir, and might I just say that this has been a Dozerblast.

Uh?

Get back to work.
Okay.

Several months now.
I feel like you might need a breather, so I've prepared an eight-point presentation on community engagement.
We'll get to your presentation, Raymond.
It's on the agenda.
Well, it says here it's scheduled ""after everyone leaves.""
And not a minute later.
Trent, Bryce, where are we with the name?
We've narrowed it down to two choices...
Petey or Paulie.
With all due respect, that pigeon is clearly a Ray J.
Hi. Gina Linetti, the human form of the 100 emoji.
I'd like to hear Captain Holt's thoughts on a name.
Very well. My thoughts are... who cares?
Give us a name, Raymond.
Weigh in on this.
It's your job now.
No.
A name.
Petey or Paulie, which is it?
What does it matter?
Why'd you even choose a pigeon anyway?
It's a terrible mascot.
Because they're a staple of New York, they're nonthreatening, and they're everywhere.
They're carriers of disease, and they eat garbage!
Name the pigeon, Raymond!
You can't make me.
I can make you, and I will.
Name the pigeon. That's an order!
Paulie.
Thank you.
Was that so hard?
[sighs]
Yeah, I'm trying to find some evidence.
I'm just gonna look in here.
Another perfect cover. Two for two. Nailed it.
All right, I talked to Dozerman and convinced him to outlaw all personal talk at work.
We're in the clear.
And everyone hates you for that, but this is totally working, and no one knows.
I know. It's the best.
And you know what? I'm glad we broke the rule and had s*x on the first date.
Me too, 'cause we're, like, really good at it.
So good, right?
Stupid good.
It makes no sense.
[gasps]
We're light and breezy.
If we want to break rules, break rules.
Like, what's another rule we could break?
No making out at work.
Okay, that's very flattering, Amy, but there are some rules that I shall never...
Let's go.
Okay.



Dozerman: Warning. Unknown environment. Unknown environment.
What's that noise?
I don't hear anything.
Dozerman: Warning. Unknown environment. Unknown environment. Warning. Unknown environment.
What? I put it up there for safe keeping.
Safe keeping?
Yeah.
I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it.
Oops.
Dozerman: Tamper alert.
Tamper alert.
Come on, Diaz.
You two have been in this evidence locker for...
Hey!
What? Nothing.
Nothing... you were just making out with Peralta.
Ah, there's that candy bar wrapper I was looking for.
Oh, Santiago, what are you doing here?
[chuckles]
So I guess it is hos before cho's with you, friend.
Now I understand why nothing gets done in this precinct.
The detectives are too busy frenching with each other, but you know what?
Your little honeymoon is over!
'Cause as long as I'm here, you two are done!
And I'm gonna be here a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long...
[squeaks]
Oh, this is a heart attack.
This right here, this is a heart attack.
Ooh, it's a big one. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm gonna get help.
Sir, it's all right. We're getting help.
[grunts] Okay.
Tell my wife that I love her... work ethic.
What happened in there?
Nothing. We were just working, separately.
Yeah, and then Dozerman just came in and died.
Peacefully, like an old cat.
Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled?
Ah...
[exhales]
Nope. Uh...
[gibbers]
He might have been startled by how far apart we were standing.
That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut.
Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes.
Right, the surveillance tapes.
Yep, because this is a police precinct.
You two have something to tell me?
All right, fine.
Detective Santiago and I may have been in there snorking.
Yes!
Oh!
Wait. What about the gym floozy?
Amy was the gym floozy.
The gym floozy was under my nose the whole time.
Oh, I am over the moon.
Okay.
Over the moon.
All right.
So what is this?
Casual? Serious?
I need to know how to make fun of you.
You guys dating?
Yes.
No.
Oh, that's not good.
I mean, yes.
I just said no because of the rules.
We said we weren't gonna tell anyone.
It's very new, and we're still figuring it out.
Enough. Look.
Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment.
As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you.
So, Boyle...
Mm.
Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah?
Oh, absolutely.
Mm.
Captain, I know this isn't my place to say, but Madeline Wuntch is here to see you.
Actually that's exactly your place to say.
You are my assistant.
What precisely did you think your job was?
Ideally? Bullfighter.
But it's such a boys' club.
Hmm.
Ooh.
I like what you've done with your office, Raymond.
It's cozy, like a shoebox one buries a dead hamster in.
So what did you want to see me about?
I'd like to propose a truce.
Our feud is getting in the way of the NYPD's business.
Madeline, the PR department is a joke.
Their work here is meaningless.
Nine weeks to choose the name Paulie.
I knew instantly it should be Pepper, Officer Pepper O'Pigeon.
Maybe we should start the whole naming process all over again.
I could turn this department around if you'd let me.
You're wasting my talents.
This man is a Timberlake, and you need to stop treating him like a Fatone.
Yes, yes, perhaps you're right.
Perhaps I am wasting your talents.
I want you to spread your wings, as it were.
I think we've found the perfect person to wear the pigeon costume.
It's you, Raymond.
Do we need to get the costume altered, or do you have your own pigeon pants?
No, Madeline, I don't have my own pigeon pants.
Dozerman: You are 43 minutes behind.
I know. Get off my back, computer ghost.
Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge?
The guy is dead.
It's not a game.
I'm following our captain's orders.
His orders were stupid.
I hated him more than any cop I've ever known.
[gasps]
Whoa.
I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face.
I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same.
He was trying to make our precinct better.
Look. Holt's gone.
Dozerman died.
Who knows who we're getting next?
I'm just trying to keep this place running.
That's my job.
[electronic chime]
Case cleared!
Yeah, how do you like me now, sucker?
I mean, I hope you found peace.
Hey, so everybody knows about us now, which means all the rules have been broken and nothing bad happened.
Nothing bad happened?
Terry yelled at us, and we killed our captain.
Jake, is this a bad idea?
It seems like the universe is sending us a lot of signs that we should hit the brakes.
Hasn't exactly been light and breezy.
Yeah, it's been a little more stressful and death-y.
You have to admit it hasn't started out great.
What do you want to do, then?
Go back to being colleagues?
Yeah.
Maybe that's what it needs to be right now.
[funky music]
Okay.
Okay.

Sorry.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Boyle, can we please just go to dinner?
No, no, no, no, no!
This is not how you and Amy are supposed to end.
You're supposed to grow old and die holding each other as your cruise ship slowly takes on water.
What do you want me to say?
We tried really hard. We made rules.
We kept it light and breezy.
Light and breezy?
Ow!
Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pantsuit, not a relationship you care about.
We were just being cautious.
Cautious?
Ow!
You guys started this with one foot out the door.
That's what doomed you, not the universe.
Actually, it makes a lot of sense.
Ow, I was agreeing with you!
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited about all this!
All right, so what do I do?
Tell me.
Easy.
You march over there, you tell her how you feel, and you bring a fancy bottle of lavender shampoo, because shampooing a woman's head is the most erotic thing you could ever possibly...
No, no, no shampoo. That's the worst.
But I am gonna go over there.
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.
Yes! Go get her.
No! Wait till it starts raining.
No, that's crazy. Go now.
Okay.
Ahh!
Sorry! Sorry.
It's okay.
I was home, and I really wanted to talk to someone about us and Dozerman and about Holt being gone, and then I realized that the only person I want to talk about that stuff with is you.
So screw just being colleagues, and screw light and breezy, right?
[sighs]
Definitely.
Guys, we did it.
We really did it.
Oh, Charles is here.
Big time.
[bell ringing]
Captain.
The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is.
I told 'em he got sucked up into an airplane engine.
Is that all right?
I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina.
Wuntch has defeated me.
This is how it ends, with me standing on the urine-soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume.
I quit.
No.
I did not follow you to PR to watch you quit.
I followed you because you're great and because you make everything you touch better, and I figured PR would be the easiest path to launching my reality show ""Linetti, Set, Go.""
I thought your reality show was to be called ""Gina in a Bottle.""
No, that was my fragrance line.
Keep up.
Listen.
You cannot let Wuntch defeat you.
That is not who you are.
You are a person who will go out there and deliver his eight-point plan on whatever, whatever.
Community engagement.
Whatever.
Even if the only people listening are a bunch of second graders, because Captain Raymond Holt never gives up!
Inspiring words.
I'm going to give that speech.
Help me with that pigeon head.
Yeah, all right.
Let's blow some tiny minds.
[electronic chime]
Dozerman: Rosa Diaz, you are six hours ahead of schedule.
Great job.
Wow, Diaz.
That's the first time I've seen him smile.
I didn't do it for him.
I did it 'cause it's my job.
We cool?
We're cool.
Good.
[banging]
Dozerman: Damage. Critical damage.
[electronic beeping]
There's a rumor the new captain'll be here today.
Now, I don't know who Wuntch is sending us, but it doesn't matter, because we're a family, we're strong, and together, we can do anything.
Nine-Nine!
All: Nine-Nine!
[funky music]
What's up, ding-dongs?
I'm your new captain.
The Vulture.
No.
Still hot.
Now, I know we have our history, me vulturing your cases, me telling you to eat my farts, but that's all in the past, 'cause now that I run this precinct, things are gonna get much, much worse.
So suck it.
No!

03x02 - The Funeral

Okay, squad, the funeral's at 3:00, followed by a reception at Shaw's Bar.
I want you all on your best behavior.
Yeah, and all eyes are gonna be on us because Frick and Frack here killed Captain Dozerman.
Hey, we accidentally startled a man with a genetic heart condition.
If you really think about it, his parents killed him.
All right, whatever.
Look, there's a horse race going off in Dubai.
I got serious money on it.
Dismissed.
Oh, yeah, we should all check out that race.
God.
He is the worst captain we've ever had.
He drew boobies on my bulletproof vest.
He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.
He heard that I speak Spanish, and he made me fire his housekeeper.
She was Polish.
At least he doesn't practice his crane kicks with you.
[both grunt]
I said not to move!
I didn't move.
Listen, guys.
Jake and I were talking last night.
Pillow talk alert! Set the scene.
Spooning or face-to-face?
Charles.
[whispering] Spooning.
Anyway, we came up with a plan.
Jake is going to befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us.
It's true.
I'm gonna bro down with him.
If everything goes according to plan, we should be beer pong doubles partners by the end of the week.
Now somebody get me a puka shell necklace.
I'm going full douche.
♪ ♪
Okay.
Hey, 'sup, bro?
'Sup, Jake?
Got a little update for you on that Deberg assault case.
Turns out the victim's wife was super hot.
Yeah, I read the file. She's a mom.
Not interested.
True that.
So listen, I've been thinking.
We got off on the wrong foot here.
And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar.
You do?
Absolutely.
We both love premium tequila...
Yeah.
Robin Thicke.
Oh, yeah.
Gots to have my puks.
Gots to.
And of course, most importantly: Nip slips.
[chuckles] Let me ask you a question, Jake.
You also like Okinawan martial arts?
Because you left this in my back.
Hmm?
What I'm saying, Einstein, is that you stabbed me in my back.
How so?
We came up with a plan.
Jake is going to befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us.
Busted. I knew that you were faking it.
I'll bet you don't even like nip slips!
So, what, you bugged the briefing room?
No, Scully butt-dialed me yesterday and he still hasn't hung up.
Once again, Scully's butt is the downfall of this precinct.
Look, Jake, I know that you and Santiago are trying to take me down.
You guys go home. You lay in bed together.
You plot against me.
Well, no longer.
I want you to dump Santiago, and that's an order.
What? You can't do that.
It's completely against the rules.
Okay, Sonia Sotomayor.
I would never break the rules.
But what I could do, for totally ""unrelated reasons,"" is have you busted back down to a beat cop.
No, don't do that, all right?
I can learn to love nip slips.
No, you either love them, or you don't.
It's too late.
You dump Santiago, or you kiss that detective badge good-bye.
Beat it.
First time back in the Nine-Nine.
Mm.
I really miss these people, the whole crew... Jake, Terry, bleh.
I forget all the other names.
Just remember, we're here as PR representatives.
I don't wanna be.
Too bad.
We're like rock stars to these people.
They're gonna go nuts, just like...
[hushed yelling]
I would hate it if these doors opened and everyone stopped working to applaud us.
Hmm, nothing.
You must be loving this.
Yes.
What?
He's ordering us to break up?
Look, we can deal with this.
We just need a new plan.
I got it.
We lie, tell him we broke up, and then date in secret.
Great! And you'd be okay lying to your captain?
Okay, new plan.
Uh-huh.
[gasps] Captain Holt is here today.
Yes, genius!
He loves us, and he's got tons of sway in the department.
He'll tell the Vulture to back down.
Yeah, he'll be all... [with deep voice] ""Vulture, I must insist that you desist.""
I really think this is gonna work.
Also, if you ever want to bust out that Holt impression at home, I'd be okay with that.
Oh, okay.
Duly noted, super disturbing, but I'm definitely gonna do it.
Hey, G-spot!
Rosa, Charles, oh, I missed you guys so much.
Really, 'cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone.
Girl, that was just the showman in me.
PR is so boring.
I need some Nine-Nine drama, stat.
I don't think we're that dramatic.
I've been gone one week.
Jake and Amy are dating, and they've killed a person.
Come on, Charles.
You got to have something weird and tragic going on.
Nope.
Not unless you call hooking up with a girl at a funeral ""weird and tragic.""
Home run!
Her name is Lieutenant Singh.
She's super hot.
We were seated next to each other two funerals ago.
And there was hard eye contact all through ""Danny Boy.""
Last funeral, we made out in the parking lot.
This time...
[with British accent] Something naughty this way comes.
Ugh. What do you even know about this person?
Oh, we don't know anything about each other.
She says she likes that about us.
It's just pure animal attraction.
This is creepy and unlike you.
You even know her first name?
Oh, um, do animals in the wild know each other's names?
Look, all I know is, Charles Boyle is going to that funeral, and he's going to put the ""bone"" back in boneyard.
Hmm, strange to be on this side of the desk.
Why?
Oh, right, you used to work here.
You know I made a lot of improvements since you left?
I got a fridge for my protein shakes.
I got a kettlebell station.
I got a wolf that I killed in Utah.
I'm fairly certain that's a dog.
Yeah, it was dark.
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to sign these...
Captain Holt, I didn't realize you were here.
Sergeant Jeffords, hello.
Welcome back.
Hey, you know, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Hugs are a form of inappropriate workplace touching.
Trust me, I'm very familiar with the sexual harassment guidelines.
That'll be all.
Well, I won't take up too much of your time.
Because the Nine-Nine was Captain Dozerman's last precinct, you will be seated at the front of the funeral.
I wanted to alert you that there'll be press, cameras...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cameras?
Crap, nobody said anything about cameras.
I got to rock the bells.
There we go.
Oh, I noticed in the bullpen that you had changed the case numbering system.
I found, when I was commanding officer, that...
I'm gonna stop you right there.
You're not commanding officer anymore.
I was making a suggestion.
Yeah, look, you did a lot of good for this place while you were here, which is great for me, because I get to take credit for it.
But you're not a real cop anymore.
You're a desk jockey.
This is my precinct now.
And the sooner that you accept that, the better.
Yes, well, I know my way out.
'Cause you used to work here.
I keep forgetting.
Everybody does.
Well, well, if it isn't Captain Raymond Jacob Holt.
It's great to see you back at the Nine-Nine, sir.
Yes.
There it is, that classic Jake Holt banter, zingers just flying around.
It's like you never left.
No, I most definitely left.
Okay.
Well, I know how much you love hot goss, so you probably heard Amy and I have been dating.
And we would love your approval.
No.
But that's not what this is about.
It sure is not.
Sir, the Vulture is out of control.
All right, he told me if I don't dump Amy, he's gonna demote me.
You got to help us.
Let me stop you right there, Peralta.
I'm not the Chief of Detectives.
I'm not the Vulture's boss.
I'm just some guy in PR.
But we thought...
I can't save your ass.
I don't work here anymore.
And the sooner you accept that, the better.
Well, looks like somebody's got a bad case of the funeral crankies.
Okay, guys,
I know Captain Dozerman was a nightmare and that none of us liked him.
But I'm gonna need all of you to pretend like you're sad.
Everyone make a sad face.
Scully, you are nailing it!
My wife just texted. She's leaving me.
Good, use it.
Now, anyone seen Captain Holt?
He seemed a little down when he came in.
Yeah, he let me choose the music on the way over here, which leads me to believe he's given up on life.
I got to go find him.
Now, be respectful and grieve your asses off.
I don't know why this is happening.
Scully, I love it!
Everyone follow his lead.
So what are we gonna do about the Vulture?
I've got a new plan. Pretend like we're talking.
We are talking.
Exactly.
It's working already.
Now I'm going to coolly run my hands through my hair.
Look where my elbow's pointing.
[gasps] It's Davis Garmin, Chief of Detectives.
Holt said he could overrule the Vulture.
Exactly.
The only question now is, will he believe us?
Yes, 'cause we're gonna take a page from the Vulture's book.
""The Big Book of Small Butts""?
What?
It's the only thing I've ever seen him read.
No, we're gonna secretly record the Vulture telling you to dump me.
Then we'll play it for Chief Garmin.
Then...
We're gonna totally have s*x on top of each other.
You get to keep your job.
Yes, that.
Ooh, Charles, your jump-off is here.
Hello, Detective.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Real tragic about the captain.
Yes, real tragic.
I like the way your butt looks today.
I've been doing lunges in the shower.
Well, this got upsetting real quick.
I want to live in this moment forever.
I got us a motel room across the street.
Meet me there in 15 minutes.
I'll meet you, all right.
M-E-A-T.
Still think it's creepy?
Yes.
Charles, it is not like you to have s*x with a total stranger.
Really, tell that to me in an hour when we've had s*x 23 times.
There you are.
You okay, sir?
No.
Until this morning, some small part of me still believed I would be captain of the Nine-Nine again.
What a fool I was.
I should never have returned.
It's like visiting your childhood home and seeing it's been replaced by a denim pants store.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down, sir.
You didn't even stop and sniff the bouquet.
You always sniff the bouquet.
Maybe the old Holt did.
But the new Holt chugs Beaujolais from a Burgundy glass without a care.
Oh, it's a Sauternes glass.
Look, the alcohol has rendered me a simpleton.
Maybe you should just call it a day.
I can't.
I've been asked to deliver a toast here after the funeral, a message of hope.
This is what I have so far.
""Pain...""
That's it.
One tweak... maybe you should lose the word ""pain"" and then get in a cab and go home.
Maybe I will.
But first, you're gonna have one drink with me, Sergeant.
For old times' sake?
One drink, and then we go.
One drink.

Hey, Captain.
I was looking for you inside.
One thing I won't do is fart in church.
This is God's house.
Oh.
Respectful.
So listen, remember when you said to me that I have to dump Santiago or else you're gonna bust me down to beat cop?
What I remember, Jake, is you pretending to be my bro and me being like, ""I'm onto you, dillweed.
[bagpipes blaring]
Oh, uh, sorry, could you say that one more time?
I couldn't hear you over the bagpipes.
[bagpipes blaring]
Ugh, one second.
Excuse me, could you stop playing that?
Just trying to have a conversation.
I'm warming up, man. Sorry.
Yeah, I know. We just need two minutes.
No can do.
The funeral's about to start.
Everyone wants to hear me honk, so...
Do you really need to warm up, though?
I mean, you're just gonna make a terrible wall of sound.
First of all, that's offensive to me as half Scottish.
Second of all, you think you could do better?
Blow my bag.
Look, we just need a couple of minutes to chat.
That's it.
I'm not gonna stop playing until you blow it.
All right, just give it to me.
All right?
Prepare to hear me play the bagpipes perfectly.
Okay.
[bagpipes wailing]
Oh, my God.
Point proven.
Yeah, I think I've heard just about enough of this catfight.
I'm out.
Wait, Captain! Sir!
Your boyfriend... sorry, your ex-boyfriend is pathetic.
You should be glad that I ordered him to dump you.
Swish, Kobe.
Got it.
Yes! You're amazing!
[bagpipes wailing]
That was ""We Are the Champions.""
Ugh, it's impossible to find Garmin with everybody mourning all over the place.
It's like they have no respect for our sneaky plans.
I know.
Oh, look, there he is.
Oh, great.
Hi there.
Sorry, this area is reserved for close personal friends of the deceased.
Ah, well, that is us.
Dozerman and I were pretty much besties.
Went on an annual fishing trip together.
Cayuga Lake, caught a lot of Coho salmon.
We are both so bummed that he's dead.
Super bummed.
Oh, right on. Come in.
Thanks.
Blessings to you.
Blessings?
I don't know.
It's my first time in a church.
All right, how did you do that?
Simple detective work.
There was a floral arrangement up front with a picture of Dozerman and 30 of his friends holding a big fish.
Cayuga Lake, I pulled straight from the guest book.
And Coho salmon?
Well, that's just something I know about from being a man of the world.
Our special today is Coho salmon on a...
Sounds disgusting.
Do you have chicken fingers?
Impressed?
Mm-hmm.
And horrified by your eating habits.
Well, if I'm so unhealthy, how come I never go to the bathroom?
Okay, let's get to Garmin.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Margaret Dozerman.
How did you know my husband?
Oh, Mrs. Dozerman, your husband was a great man.
Some of my fondest memories of him were on our fishing trips.
You went on those trips?
I did, indeed.
They called me ""the Coho King.""
Pretty much single-handedly organized those things myself.
So you were the one who brought all the prostitutes?
Uh...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can we slow down?
Why? Are you not into this?
No, no, no.
My friends are just in my head.
They think it's weird that we don't know anything about each other.
I think it's hot.
Totally, I'm glad we're not interested in each other as human beings.
Oh, how about if you tell me things about yourself and then I tell you how little I care about them?
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
I'm an only child.
Not interested.
I was born in Delaware.
Who even asked you?
I like this.
I don't care what you like.
But maybe you could tell me one more thing.
She's a vegan!
What is going on?
You're right. I couldn't help myself.
I wanted to know about her.
And I got what I deserved... a vegan, a gluten-free vegan!
Charles, you need to calm down.
No. You called it, Rosa.
So go ahead. Laugh at me!
Laugh!
Laugh it up!
Can I wait till after the funeral?
Shh!
Of course you can.
Sir, my life stinks.
Sharon's on bed rest.
My favorite mango yogurt got discontinued.
And my kids think their preschool teacher's a stupidface.
Everyone I work with is a stupidface.
Especially Bryce.
Sir?
Hmm?
Sir?
Hmm?
Sir?
Hmm?
Can I be honest?
Precinct's not the same without you.
The Vulture's the worst.
My mango yogurt...
Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt.
'Cause it's important!
When I saw you in the office this morning, I wanted to give you the biggest hug.
But the Vulture told you not to, and you had to listen.
He's your captain now, Terry.
I hate going to work and you're not there.
Everything is garbage.
Hmm. ""Everything is garbage.""
I should put that in my message of hope.
That's a really good idea!
It took my husband and me years of counseling to get over those little backwood orgies of yours.
He had s*x with five prostitutes in one weekend.
Ugh!
That's bananas!
I had no idea.
I was probably too busy praying.
You said you planned the trips.
Yeah, I did say that.
Called yourself the Coho King.
All right, look.
I'm not the Coho King.
My name is Jake.
And your husband was only my captain for, like, a day.
Wait a second.
Are you the Jake that killed him?
No, I'm prostitute Jake.
I love prostitutes.
You need to go.
You should leave right now.
You need to leave right now.
It's okay, Margaret. Come on.
Oh, Chief Garmin, wait, I just... need to play you one quick recording of my boss.
You recorded me?
That's not cool, Jake.
Well, we were just taking a page out of your book.
Yeah? What are you gonna do next, huh?
Are you gonna start wearing leather bracelets, hmm?
Good luck pulling off that chunky-B with those skinny little girl wrists of yours.
Congratulations.
You're no longer a detective.
You're a beat cop again.
I just crushed your dreams.
[clicks tongue]
Okay, I know things seem really bad right now, but we just need a minute to think.
[bagpipes playing ""Amazing Grace""]
Come on, man!
Okay, so the Vulture has your phone.
But new plan...
Jake, we've had lots of plans, and none of them have worked.
Yeah, but this is a good one.
The new plan is: No plan.
We wing it!
Probably won't work, but I said it with a lot of confidence.
Jake, you got demoted.
We said this relationship wasn't gonna get in the way of our careers, and it has.
So what? We'll figure it out.
I'll make my way back to detective.
Or maybe you won't.
I'm not gonna let you throw away your dream job.
Amy, this is good.
This is a six-day relationship.
We don't know what it is.
And now for a message of hope.
Ah, a message of hope, right on time.
Everything is garbage.
Oh, no.
You find something you care about, and it's taken from you... your colleague, your dream job, your mango yogurt.
Whoo!
Never love anything.
That's the lesson.
To Captain Dozerman.
All: Captain Dozerman.
Thank you, sir.
I'll take it from here. Very poetic.
If I might offer a counter-toast of sorts.
Captain Dozerman and I, we weren't together for very long.
In fact, as coworkers, our relationship was only six days.
But that's not nothing.
It was long enough for me to know that we had something special.
And sure, there may be obstacles.
Him having passed away, for example.
But I'm not giving up on us.
And I don't care if I get demoted.
I just care about being with you...
Captain Dozerman, an adult man who has passed into the nether world.
Move over, Peralta!
Move over!
Okay.
And if I may do a third toast.
It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt.
[all groan]
Don't boo me!
I lost something important too, shoot.
Thought I might find you here.
So not a big fan of my speech, huh?
No, I loved it.
I mean, I wish it hadn't been at a wake.
And I wish you hadn't kept referring to me as your dead boss.
Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt but still was somehow the best of the three toasts.
Hmm.
Look, I don't want to break up.
But I don't want to get demoted either.
I just don't know what to do.
I'm all out of plans.
I have one.
Holt saves your ass.
Captain.
I was moved by your speech, Peralta.
Thank you, sir. That's very nice of you to say.
The syntax was problematic.
Less nice.
And your vocabulary is a true indictment of the public school system.
Seems like you're just slamming me now.
But the fact that you're not willing to give up in the face of adversity is inspiring.
I love the Nine-Nine, and I'm not gonna turn my back on the squad.
So I fixed your problem with the Vulture.
Really?
I may just be a guy in PR.
But what does the Vulture love more than anything?
Garbage Pail Kids?
No. Publicity.
Captain Pembroke, how would you like your face on the NYPD website?
Really?
Yes! Yes!
In exchange for media attention, the Vulture will not bust you down or stand in the way of you two dating.
Sir, I don't know how to thank you.
Anything for the Nine-Nine.
Thank you, sir.
He totally approves of us.
Whatcha doing there, Boyle?
Trying to get drunk enough to have sexual intercourse with a vegan.
Why can't I just think with my junk like a modern man?
Why do you want to do that?
[sighs]
I got divorced, and I was crushed.
My fiancée left. I cried for weeks.
My only relationship that wasn't totally devastating when it ended was my casual s*x carnival with Gina.
Yeah, okay, But with of those relationships made you happiest before it ended?
[sighs]
My marriage. Vivian.
Yeah, because you connect with them emotionally, something we did not do because I'm a higher level of being, like Her from the movie ""Her.""
Dude, you can't go through life trying not to get hurt.
You should try to be happy.
So you think I should look for someone I can have emotional intercourse with.
I wish you hadn't said it like that, but yeah.
And I should start right here at this funeral.
I'd probably wait.
Nope, no time to lose.
Put on your sunglasses.
I need to see if there's anything in my teeth.
Ugh.
Oh, yeah.
Charles Boyle is ready for love.
Well, never wearing these again.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to start clapping, 'cause I just made a major drug bust.
Talking about four kilos of cocaine, $200,000 cash, and my new partner, a tarantula.
I call him Jake Jr., aka spidey Klum, aka Mrs. doubtspider, aka Joe spiden, aka tarantula basset, aka spi-dermot mulrooney.
Aka tarantulina jolie.
What?
No, Charles, have you seen this spider?
That's a terrible name.
Sorry.
Why do you have that thing?
Because they were gonna throw him away, but I couldn't do that to my furry little... ah!
He's actually really scary up close.
It's horrifying from everywhere.
Terry hates creepy crawlers.
Seriously, I'm not going to your apartment if that thing is there.
All right, fine, then he'll just live here and help me solve crimes.
Get used to him, everyone, 'cause me and this spider are partners for life.
He's gone.
I left the cage unlocked, and he's gone.
Somebody find him!
Stay off the ground!
I'm good.
I'm out of here.
He couldn't have gone far...
Unless he can fly.
Can tarantulas fly?
Jake, you better find that spider.
And I'm not coming back here until you do.
Uh, sarge, I think I found it.
[Gasps]
Why are you looking at me like that?
Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh.
It's on my head!
[Screams]
[Upbeat music]
A whole hour until we testify.
Hey, donut holes.
Don't mind if I do.
Ugh!
Fish?
Fish donuts, boyle?
What is wrong with you?
It's takoyaki.
I'm drowning my sorrows in octopus balls.
I've been online dating; It's a total disaster.
I've only had one match, and it was a pretty obvious catfish situation.
My name yennifer.
You give me social security?
Oh, yennifer...
Now, I see that as a positive story.
Out of all the identities he could have stolen, he chose yours, and you want to know why?
Because I posted my annual income?
Because you posted your annual income, you moron.
Excuse me, is that takoyaki?
Yeah, from senka, right down the street.
Oh, I love that place.
The chef lets me take octopus hearts home for my dogs.
Oh, lucky!
How many dogs do you have?
Oh, too many.
Three.
That's how many I have.
Oh.
All right, wait, quick question.
How do you keep them off the bed?
I gave up.
I sleep on the floor.
Me too.
Both: It's better for your back.
[Laughter]
Wow.
Well, nice meeting you.
What are you doing?
She's walking away.
I got nervous.
She eats octopus balls, and she sleeps on the floor.
She's the perfect woman.
Oh, my God.
Sorry, I was aiming at somebody else, but now that I have your attention, Charles?
He was aiming at a terrible cwim... criminal, he probably saved the world.
Do you want to have tak-takoyaki at the... um, on the bench over there?
Sure, I was hoping you'd ask.
My work here is done.
Ugh, still fish.
Oh, God.
Santiago, thank you for coming in.
It's no secret the NYPD has an image problem.
Yeah, when I told my garbage man I was a cop, he said, ""gross.""
He had someone else's band-aid stuck to him.
Police approval ratings are... pardon my language... in the commode.
All the headlines are about the bad cops, but there are good cops too, and I want to put up posters that showcase some of our best.
I'd like you to be on the first one.
Shut up, ray.
I mean, interesting, captain.
I'll think about it.
Wow, this is a bad idea.
First off, Amy has an epic lack of swagger.
Uh, I'll have you know I have swagger.
I ooze swagger.
Right.
More importantly, putting up a bunch of photos of smiling cops isn't gonna change how people feel about us.
I think this campaign is very promising.
Santiago, what's your take?
Oh, right, let's hear an unbiased opinion from your straight-up swimfan.
[Scoffs]
I think it's a great idea, sir.
Well, you can count me out.
I will not pose for your posters.
I didn't ask you, and you're not a police officer.
Yeah, I'm out.
Sarge, permission to arrest Hitchcock and Scully.
I told you before, it's not harassment unless you can prove intent to fart.
No, it's not that.
They robbed me.
They ate my moose tracks ice cream.
[Laughs]
That's funny.
I wouldn't think you like moose tracks.
My boyfriend Marcus introduced me to it.
[Laughs]
What?
It is a delicious treat for all ages.
Damn, rosa, okay.
Look, I think they've been skimming people's desserts for weeks, but I can never prove it.
Did you see them take your ice cream?
No, but Hitchcock has fudge stains all over his chest.
He's always got fudge stains all over his chest.
Ugh.
They'll deny everything.
We need hard proof.
So let's get it.
Step one: Put a delicious pie in the fridge and cover it with poison.
That's step one?
What's step two?
Tell their widows they were thieves.
Hey, where'd she go?
You guys were hitting it off.
I half expected to see you sitting in her lap by now.
She is amazing.
Her palate is wide and deep.
Gross.
And at one point when she wasn't looking, I snuck a whiff of her hair.
Of course you did.
She uses one of my top three shampoos: Tahitian coconut, extra lather.
Sounds good, boyle.
Did you get her number?
Oh, we lost track of time.
She had to go back into court.
When she's done, I'm gonna ask her out.
Oh, okay, okay.
So what's the plan?
Going straight from here to the spa.
Couples massage.
Okay, seems a little intense, but given how your other weirdness lined up, I say go for it.
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, okay.
How do I look?
You look great.
I've got a good feeling about this.
Genevieve, I know we just met, and I don't want to be too forward...
Charles.
But sometimes you just get a feeling about a person....
Charles.
And I've got that feeling about you.
I like you...
Charles, look down.
I think tonight we... oh, shoot.
They just gave me ten years in prison.
She didn't say no.
Hey, buddy.
Got you some of those fish donuts you like so much to cheer you up.
Although, full disclosure, I couldn't find where they sold them, so that's just a chocolate ꤬air with lox on it.
Oh, thanks, Jake, but I don't need cheering up.
You can eat it yourself.
Nope.
So what, you're not upset about falling hard for a lady who was immediately thrown in jail?
No, because she's not actually guilty.
They say she robbed her own art gallery for the insurance money, but that makes no sense.
She would have made more if the art had sold.
This piece, ""breastfeeding knight,"" was worth twice what she got from the insurance company.
Wow, look at that.
Not to sound overly intellectual, but dem knight boobies is crazy.
[Laughs] I get art.
Also, I talked to Genevieve's lawyer.
He's a total disaster.
I have a couple questions about a beautiful client of yours, Genevieve mirren-Carter.
She got hit by a tow truck and sued the driver?
No, she was accused of insurance fraud.
Oh, good, because I blew that tow truck case.
Straight-up forgot to go to court.
Well, they found one of the stolen paintings at her house.
But she said she didn't know how it ended up there.
She's being set up.
Framed.
Art joke. Continue.
My hunch is that it's a jealous ex-lover.
A girl like that, three dogs, makes her own turkey stock, that's the kind of woman you don't get over.
Look, I know you think my judgment's clouded because I like her a little bit...
You doodled your wedding invitation.
No, that's our joint tombstone.
My mistake.
But as a cop, I really don't think that she did it.
Something is off about the case.
Okay, boyle.
I trust your gut.
Let's go free an innocent woman.
Nice!
My dreams are coming true.
You and me getting my lady off together.
I mean, you know how that sounds, right?
Look strong but fair.
But approachable.
But professional.
And fun.
But not too fun.
This is your job.
Can you handle all that?
Sir, ""fun but not too fun"" was my campaign slogan when I ran for prom queen.
Did you win?
No.
Ames?
I want to say you look great.
Thank you.
You didn't let me finish.
Dot, dot, dot, for you.
Great news is, it doesn't matter, because this campaign, like three out of five backstreet boys, is inconsequential.
That's enough, Gina.
All I'm saying as a... if not the... voice of the streets is, this tisn't gonna work.
And all I'm saying as a... if not the... boss here is, if you're not gonna support me, you can leave.
Fine.
I will leave.
I'm gonna go get a mani-pedi, and I'm gonna do some serious subtweeting, so you might want to [whispering] Keep off the net.
Diaz.
Look what I found in Hitchcock and Scully's trash can: Ice cream spoon.
Son of a bitch.
You hungry, hungry hippos ate my ice cream.
Why was this in your trash?
And who throws away a spoon?
It's the easiest utensil to clean.
I don't even think it's ice cream.
It's probably medicine.
You know, I'm on lots of medicines, rosa.
I'm sick all over.
This is ice cream, and I'm gonna prove it.
Sarge, no.
It's been in their mouths.
What am I doing?
Well, I guess your little investigation has hit a dead end.
I'll be back.
Don't move.
Not a problem.
I hate moving.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Interesting.
Yeah, something definitely doesn't add up.
Did you know there's a sausage you can drink?
What?
Are you even talking about the case?
We got distracted.
She has an amazing tongue.
Strong, supple, great bud density.
Okay, I'm gonna take over the questioning.
Yeah, I'm too close to this.
Disgusting eating habits.
Hi, Genevieve.
I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions now, and detective boyle will just sit there and keep waving at you, I guess.
Now then, is there anybody you can think of besides yourself that has access to the gallery after hours?
No, just me, and the vault is only accessible through fingerprint ID.
Does Charles have a girlfriend?
I just saw her mouth my name.
What did she say?
Is she asking if I'm circumcised?
What? No.
Who asks that?
Stop interrupting.
Sorry about that.
Okay, next question.
Can you think of anyone that might be trying to set you up?
Maybe an employee or a rival of some kind?
Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick.
He's an artist, a terrible one.
He was always in debt and begging for money.
That's why we broke up.
Maybe he's resentful.
Dirtbag ex.
Oh, that was my theory, remember?
Tell her it was my theory.
Okay.
Wait, give me a second.
I want to look smart when you say it.
Okay.
Uh, hey, Genevieve, detective boyle wanted me to let you know that he, a college graduate, had a similar theory that it could have been an ex-boyfriend.
Wow.
He is so smart.
Wow, it actually worked.
I've got to hand it to you, buddy whatever you're putting down, she is picking up.
Oh, good.
Oh, one more thing.
Boyle has another question.
Tell her when this is all over, I'm gonna rub her body in pate, and then rub it off her with a cornichon.
I'm just gonna give the phone back.
Okay.



Hi.
Guard got nauseous, so we had to stop.
Hmm, that's weird.
Do you think it's because you're the two most disgusting people in the universe?
Could be.
Yeah, check this out.
Remember the ex-boyfriend that she mentioned, Nick?
Call him Mr. butthead.
Okay, well, apparently Mr. butthead just bought a brand-new gallery in dumbo to showcase his art, which is weird, because Genevieve said he was always in debt.
Looks like somebody just came into a ton of money.
Oh, and you think she's gonna want to get back together with him now that he's rich.
Damn it!
No, boyle.
He probably got the cash from selling the stolen art.
Your hunch was right.
Yeah, it was.
♪ my hunch, my hunch, my lovely case-y hunch ♪
Come on, Jake, sing with me.
That's not gonna happen.
I will literally never...
♪ whatcha gonna do with all that hunch ♪
♪ all that hunch inside your brain ♪
both: ♪ we're gonna solve, solve, solve this case ♪
♪ solve this case right in your face ♪
We should probably leave this prison.
Yep.
Okay, here's my cover.
My name is sherwin lemonde, sculptor, painter, full-time barista.
But once I sell my first piece, part-time barista.
Oh, nice.
I'm Donald hoberman-seitz.
I wear glasses.
Is that all you got?
Sorry, I spent the cab ride here imagining me and Genevieve kissing.
Okay, just let me do the talking.
Wine?
Yes, thank you so much.
Oh, wow, I love your outfit.
I'm an artist, so I get that it's more than just tight.
Nick likes to coat women in latex.
He's fascinated by the idea of the human chrysalis in society's pupation.
Hmm, cool.
Human chrysalis and whatnot.
Yeah, whatnot.
It's a whatnot.
Yeah, yeah.
I have no idea what a chrysalis is, but serious question: If she farts in that thing, does it blow up like a balloon?
You have to assume that it would.
You have to, right?
Yeah.
Art is so intense.
It really is.
Look, there's Nick.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Is this your work?
Yes.
It's good.
I haven't talked to anyone here, but it almost seems like you're going for a human chrysalis thing.
I'm glad you like it.
I wish I could take credit, but this is society.
I'm just holding up the mirror.
Hmm?
Wow.
You meant that literally.
Very cool.
Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist named sherwin.
I'm Donald hoberman-seitz.
I wear glasses.
So anyway, I was wondering.
How'd you get your own gallery?
It must be really expensive.
Art's not about the money, man.
Totally.
It's more about the other things.
Right on.
This painting is called ""Genevieve 416.""
What's that all about?
Well, April 16th was the day my ex, Genevieve, and I covered ourselves with paint and made love on that canvas for 24 hours straight.
That's pretty pathetic, dude.
You seem pretty obsessed with Genevieve, huh?
Excuse me?
Donald.
I bet it really hurt when she dumped you.
What?
Donald, your glasses.
Where were you July 21st, Mr. butthead?
Uh...
[Mocking] Uh, duh, uh...
You were robbing Genevieve's gallery.
You framed her, and I should arrest you right now.
What are you, cops?
What?
No, we're artists.
And as artists, we question everything, including certain people's whereabouts on particular dates.
Get out of here.
Fine, but we're taking this, because you don't deserve that memory.
That painting is $95,000.
I don't want it anyway.
Your pen1s was on it.
Sorry about that.
Donald is...
Sucks.
Hey, you dum-dums.
Ice cream.
Moose tracks ice cream.
How do you know?
Yep, it's definitely ice cream.
Knew it!
They're going down.
Also, whoever used this spoon, their body ain't right.
Okay, let's say it is ice cream.
But I didn't eat it; I couldn't have.
I'm lactose intolerant.
Me too.
I'm super lactose intolerant.
You're lying.
Have you ever seen us eat dairy?
You know no one can bear to watch you eat.
Check.
And...
Check.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I got to say, boyle.
Nick was pretty defensive.
Yeah, and he's a terrible artist.
All he does is have s*x on canvases.
Any fourth grader could do that.
But...
They shouldn't.
No.
Hey, Nick doesn't like cops, but he didn't do anything wrong.
And how would you know?
I'm his assistant, dvora.
He would never set up Genevieve.
He's still in love with her.
He keeps boxes of her old stuff lying around.
Ooh, can we look at, smell, and handle them?
I mean, you know, for the investigation.
We're cops.
Please, take the boxes.
I want them out of here.
Oh, okay, great.
You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?
Actually, I would.
He did a performance art piece that entire month.
He lived in a cage on the street and never left it.
The whole thing's on video.
Okay, great.
Totally.
We'll just go around back and pick up the boxes.
Oh, one more thing.
Where in this ""cage"" did he go to the bathroom?
Bucket.
Okay, gross.
Have a good night.
Sir, I saw my poster on the subway this morning.
Well, you must feel like a celebrity, a regular ira glass.
They put a Hitler mustache on me.
Yes, this is unfortunate, but let's not overreact to one graffito.
It wasn't just one.
People drew on every single poster.
They put devil horns, target on my face, this one says, ""die pig,"" and worst of all, they didn't put the comma between ""die"" and ""pig.""
This is easily dealt with.
I'll just issue a statement saying vandals will be prosecuted.
It's not just vandalism, sir.
People have real complaints too.
""End stop and frisks. Stop racial profiling. Unlawful arrest is a crime.""
I see.
I think Gina was right about the campaign, sir.
Hmm.
I'm surprised she hasn't marched in here to say, ""I told you so.""
She wouldn't do that.
You're right, Amy.
For once in your life, you're 100% right.
I would never say that.
Did you have enough time to read it all?
Yes.
Okay, good.
Yep, it's true.
He sat in a cage for a month.
Eww, the bucket checks out.
This is insane.
Anything is art.
Here, watch this.
A statue of Jesus made out of cigarette butts.
Boom, I'm a millionaire.
That's actually pretty good.
I know.
And I I could call it ""holy smokes.""
Should we really do this?
No, right?
That's crazy; You can't just become an artist out of nowhere.
Jake.
What?
The case.
Yeah.
So Nick has an alibi; That's not great.
But we have a box of Genevieve's stuff from the gallery.
I'm sure there's something in here that will exonerate her.
Right.
Oh, my God.
Socks and shoes.
This is exactly the type of stuff I own.
This is kismet.
Oh, no, what's this?
It's a receipt for a storage unit that she didn't tell anyone about.
It's probably nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Yeah.
It's totally nothing.
No.
It's a bunch of stolen art.
[Sighs]
Hey, buddy.
Sorry about Genevieve.
It's okay.
I'm resigned to my life of solitude.
Just me and my five dogs.
Wait, I thought you only had three dogs.
I just adopted two online right now.
Oh, this pit bull hates kids.
That's fine; I'll never have any.
Add to cart.
Okay, let me just grab that.
Listen to me, Charles.
You're gonna be fine.
There are plenty of women out there.
Strong, beautiful, smart women.
How about her?
She's very beautiful.
With my luck, she's probably a car thief.
Don't be ridiculous.
Hey, Scully.
Yeah?
Who's the babe?
Just booked her for elder abuse.
Elder abuse, that's nice.
All right, fine.
We shouldn't be doing this at a precinct.
I really thought I was gonna get Genevieve out of prison.
Then we'd cover ourselves in paint and make love for 25 hours, one more hour than her and Nick.
Boyle, you would hate that.
Your little hummingbird heart would explode.
I wish I didn't have a heart.
I'm off to the cheese shop...
And I'm buying by the wheel.
The cheese wheel.
Yeah, I got it.
Gina, as you predicted, there was some backlash to the poster campaign.
Yes, I'm the nostradamus of your shame.
I think a problem the police have had is our inability to admit our mistakes, so this campaign was, um...
A mistake.
You told me that, but I got defensive and didn't listen.
I should have been open to criticism, as this department should be open to criticism.
That's why I'm replacing these with...
These.
My email address is at the bottom, and I intend to respond to every message I receive.
Before we put them up, I want to hear your thoughts.
I love them.
Once again, my advice has, like, saved the city.
I came up with the slogan.
It's tacky to take credit for stuff.
We're here to apologize.
I can't prove you took my moose tracks, so I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I'm impressed.
It takes a big person to admit when they're being a total dum-dum.
We want to make it up to you.
We got you a pizza.
Only one pizza for both of us?
Oh, my God.
That was an obvious setup, you morons.
You're eating cheese.
You're lying about being lactose intolerant.
No, we weren't.
Some things are just delicious enough to suffer the consequences.
I'm diabetic, but I still eat sugar out of the bag.
Both: Ugh!
Just admit you took my moose tracks.
Admit it!
Admit...
It.
Yeah, we ate it.
And we're eating your pizza.
So who's the moron now?
Ooh, stomach.
Oh, yeah.
It's coming.
They admitted it.
That's a victory, right?
No, Terry.
There are no winners here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Coming through, coming through!
Move it!
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!
Getting in a little late there this morning, boyle.
Where you been?
Cursing out my own shadow for hanging out with a loser like me.
Also an eye doctor appointment.
Well, there's something in the holding cell that might cheer you up.
That's Nick's assistant.
Why is she here?
After you left last night, I was thinking about the 24-hour s*x painting, ""Genevieve 416.""
Check out the date on this receipt from the storage locker with the stolen art.
April 16th.
416!
Exactly.
She couldn't have rented it, because she was busy getting busy.
Oh, good one.
This is fantastic.
I mean, I'm not happy that she was having s*x with another man, but I'm okay with it if that's what gets her off.
Do you seriously not hear it, because it almost seems intentional at this point.
Why would dvora set Genevieve up?
Because she's in love with Nick.
She used one of those latex casts of Genevieve's hand to get the fingerprints so she could break into the gallery.
Wow, I can't believe you kept working the case even after I gave up.
That was a nice thing to do.
Charles, I didn't do it to be nice.
I did it to be amazing.
And I think you're a great detective, and I trusted your gut.
Go get your girlfriend out of prison.
Oh, thanks, man.
Next time you see me, I'm gonna be all out of orgasms.
No, you can't say that while you're hugging someone.
Not a doctor. Shh.

All right, ladies, I don't got a whole lot of time here, so what do you say we make like Boyle's mom and you debrief me?
Didn't happen, and I should know.
She tells me everything.
Yeah, not everything, Chucky.
She took off my undies.
Hey, Peralta.
What is that?
This?
Yeah.
Oh, nothing.
Just open-and-shut case.
Well, it looks like a pretty fat file for a dunker.
What is it?
Just some old lady has a missing torso that we can't find.
Put it in the major crimes pile.
But we've already given them all of our felonies.
It's because I got a bet going with the captain of the A4 to see whose squad can solve the most cases.
Winner gets to choose a tattoo for the loser, and guess what I'm getting him.
Calvin peeing on the Tasmanian Devil?
No, it's supposed to be a bad tattoo.
Man, you're really stupid in the morning, aren't you?
Captain, we all want you to win that bet, but do you think maybe we could keep a few real cases?
Look, I'm gonna keep it real simple for you.
We only solve misdemeanors, wieners.
Say it.
All: We only solve misdemeanors...
Wieners.
Congratulations.
You just called yourselves wieners.
Dismissed.

[sighs]
Good morning.
For whom?
For you-m.
Okay, I can't keep lying.
Wuntch is here.
Oh, there it is.
The shriveled husk of Raymond Holt.
Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?
Enough foreplay.
I'm here to discuss the department's new smuggling task force.
The task force?
Oh, I thought you'd be handing me another vapid PR assignment.
I am.
We need to choose a phrase to replace the phrase ""task force.""
Our research suggests it's too aggressive.
What?
I like it.
Task force sounds like some sort of body spray for hot dudes.
Oh, and, um, one more thing.
Since your little stunt with the subway poster, I think you could use some supervision.
Bob will be keeping an eye on you.
It's gonna be fun, Ray.
But I'm his boss.
Oh, ouch.
How demeaning.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Sarge, you got to check this out.
Jake, what are you doing?
We can't work real cases.
This is a B and E.
Oh, it's so much more than that.
Look at these photos.
Perp came in through the back window, set up the living room to look like a kid's tea party, didn't steal anything.
Do you know what this means?
The victim still has their stuff?
The perp wasn't there to take anything... except lives.
Sorry, I always wanted to say that.
I think this is the work of the Oolong Slayer.
Seems like a stretch.
If this is the Oolong Slayer, why isn't there a body?
I don't know, maybe he got spooked before the Vic got home, or it could be...
Jake, you want a case so bad, you're making one up.
Look, the slayer hasn't struck in five years.
Chief Garmin set up a task force to find the guy and turned up nothing, and most importantly, the vulture's orders were only misdemeanors, wieners.
Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window?
Hmm?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Was that the sound of a juicy file I heard plopping down on Peralta's desk?
Yeah, it was.
You just lost your overtime privileges for the month.
Everybody, listen up.
Anyone caught working on a case that I didn't assign loses their overtime.
Capooch?
All: Capooch.
Capooch.
Uncapooch.
You didn't say ""no take backs.""
♪ ♪
Ah, there you are.
I got something real special for the two of you.
Great, what do you got?
A month from today is my birthday.
I need you to throw me a party, all right?
Make it epic, surprise me.
Are you asking us to plan you a birthday party?
Yeah, Helen Keller.
Pay attention.
Did you choose us because we're women?
Women love planning parties.
It's in the Bible.
Unbelievable.
What a waste of time.
Disagree.
This is an amazing use of time.
We have complete control over that dummy's birthday party.
We can ruin it.
Yeah, fun.
I'll just mess up a captain's orders on purpose.
It'll be so... I can't even fake it.
Yeah, baby, I can pick up the crib, right after I get the groceries and before I start painting the nursery.
Yeah, I can draw a cloud.
I don't need a stencil.
Okay, I'll get the stencil.
Look, I don't know when I'll be home.
I'll text you, okay?
Ugh, all this paperwork is gonna straight-up kill me.
How are you so chipper?
Oh, simple.
I eat a cacao nib every time I close a case.
A what?
A cacao nib.
They're these happy little chocolaty delights from deep in the Peruvian rain forest.
Here, try one.
Do I look like a man who snacks?
You look like eight circles with suspenders on.
But these aren't bad for you.
They're full of fiber and antioxidants.
Go ahead, try one.
Okay, fine.
Just one.
Mm-hmm.
Damn, these are good.
And plus, they're organic and fair trade.
Terry loves responsible agricultural practices.
Mmm.
Uh-oh.
Jake, you should not be here IRL.
Gina, my old friend who I grew up with.
So good to see you, and I have missed you so much.
Is Holt in?
Yes, of course he is, but he's in a meeting, and you can not be seen stopping by for chits and/or chats.
You need to leave.
Gina, I'm not here to waste his time, all right?
I have an extremely dope, possibly even disgusting case, and I need to discuss it with him.
A case?
Extra no.
If Wuntch finds out he's working on a case, she will punish him.
She's on the warpath right now, Jake.
The warpath.
Okay, copy that.
Loud and clear.
Don't want to cause a problem.
I will skraight-up skedaddle with no further a-do-do.

[cooing]
What's going on?
Well, Gina said we couldn't be seen together, and I need your help.
Looks like we've both got a pretty bad case of jerk boss.
Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch.
The Oolong Slayer.
He's back.
I knew you would confirm my hunch.
He's back to his cool-ass psycho ways.
Great news, right?
Aside from a serial killer being on the loose.
What's your plan?
I'm gonna work the case in secret.
Wrong.
We're gonna work the case in secret.
Holy crap.
No one can know about this, understood?
Understood.
Understood.
What?
I hang out in the men's room all the time.
♪ The acoustics are amazing ♪
If I recall correctly, the Oolong Slayer last struck five years ago.
He left behind no DNA or fingerprints, but he did leave his calling card, a tea bag in his victim's mouth.
Yeah, how cool... I mean awful... is that?
Very cool... I mean awful.
What's our strategy?
One, reexamine all the task force's files, two, check all B and Es against the slayer's MO, and three, think of something supercool to say when we arrest him.
My leading contender?
""You're going to jail for oolong time.""
Jake, that's really good.
Right?
Let's not overlook the fact that he turned his crime scenes into tea parties for dollies.
Which suggests preadolescent trauma leading to a pattern of criminality that probably began as a juvenile.
I'm taking an abnormal psych class, and everyone in it is obsessed with me.
You look into the B and Es and I'll check out the juvie angle.
Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast.
[gasps]
That's what globes are for.
A 25-year-old port seems appropriate.
I would have gone 10.
I don't know what port is.
To catching a serial killer.
To catching a serial killer.
To Rihanna, because I love Rihanna.
Okay.
Case closed.
What time is it?
That's right, it's nib o'clock.
Whoo, new case, new nib.
Read 20 words, that's a nib.
Hmm, that nib was kind of small.
Hey, sarge?
You may want to slow down on those things.
Things?
These are the precious jewels of the rain forest, Boyle.
I don't mean to overstep here, but you're looking a little... fat.
Oh, boy.
How dare you?
You can't comment on my body.
This is a workplace.
Now I'm feeling objectified by your male gaze.
Absolutely not.
Sir, just listen.
No, I don't want to listen, Boyle.
You are trying to shame me, and that will not fly.
Okay.
Now I need some more nibs just to calm down.
Jake, dope alley.
I know.
I think this is where Batman's parents got killed.
I'll take your word for it.
The juvie angle didn't pan out.
Neither did the B and Es, but I traced the label on the slayer's oolong.
Turns out he got it at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop.
Good work, Peralta.
Breakthrough selfie?
Why not?
Breakthrough.
So what's the plan, boss?
We create a diversion while Gina copies his customer files.
My thumb drive looks like a watermelon, because I adore the summertime.
Oh, I love that.
Let's do this.
Oh, hey, pal, that's my ginkgo.
It's my ginkgo now, old man.
I'm still young enough to beat that ginkgo out of your hands.

All right.
Western medicine rules!
All right, sluggers.
Let's see what you got for the big b-day bash.
I thought you wanted us to surprise you.
It's a figure of speech, Detective Stupid-ago.
Well, I was thinking a DJ, two signature cocktails, passed hors d'oeuvres Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Passed hors d'oeuvres?
What is this, a fundraiser for French dorks?
So no passed hors d'oeuvres?
I can't even answer that.
All right, tough guy.
What do you got planned?
I don't know.
Meet at a bar and... drink there.
That's it?
Well, it's still better than Santiago's.
Look, this is real important to me, all right?
My brother's hot wife is gonna be there, and I haven't seen her since his funeral.
Wow.
Yeah, right?
I mean, you only get one shot at your brother's widow.
Just go.
Oh.
Partner.
Partner.



Not many people buy that tea, and only one has been doing so since the killings first began, and he has a record.
His name?
Braxton O'Reilly.
[gasps]
He's a maniac.
Arrested in '84 for torturing an animal?
Oh, this is our guy.
Oh, man, just a squirrel?
Still counts.
Let's get that psycho.
NYPD, nobody move.
Where is Braxton O'Reilly?
Where is that psycho monster?
He's dead.
Our condolences.
You were working a case.
I freaking knew it.
You're a liar.
And you.
You can't do anything except disobey orders and screw up.
I'm disappointed too.
No one cares, Bob.
And after all your so-called detective work, you didn't even get the right guy.

It was an error, but...
Do not interrupt me.

Seven times, once for every day your juicy, insubordinate ass is suspended.
Same goes for you, Peralta.
Except for the juicy ass part, because your ass is stupid.
Now get the hell out of my office.
Wait a minute, sir.
You know what.
Screw this.
It's ten days now.
Shouldn't have gone back in.
I am skraight-up depressed.
Amy's been doing her best to cheer me up.
She gave me this sticker this morning just for waking up.
Ew, it's like you're dating your teacher.
I know. It's so hot.
Meanwhile, Holt won't even talk to me.
How is he, by the way?
Honestly, terrible.
I've only heard from him once this week, and that was to tell me he'd finally come up with a new, non-threatening term for task forces.
Ya'll ready for this?
Do groups.
Wow, that sucks tremendously.
Can I have another port?
You're still drinking that stuff?
Yeah, Holt got me hooked on it.
I even got a bottle for my house.
It's really classing up the booze and take-out menus shelf.
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured something out.
I got to go.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Uh...
No, pay your bill.
Damn, who raised you?
Oh, my God.
You friended the vulture?
Well, he's not telling us anything, so it was the only way to figure out what he likes.
Maybe this will help.
He just said his favorite color is underboob.
Look, Amy, you're a good detective.
You don't have to perfectly plan some butthead's birthday party.
I'm sorry, but I believe that hard work pays off.
Shut up.
Excuse me?
No, no, no, shut up and look.
You're completely right.
Your hard work just paid off.
The vulture is in a band?
Fantastic Jack and the Junkyard Rats.
Just when I thought he couldn't be any more the worst, he out-the worsts himself.
[laughs]
I have an idea.
I don't know why you insisted on eating here, Gina.
It seems like your average greasy spoon.
Pardon me.
Did one of you order the hot plate of justice?
Peralta, what are you doing here?
Saving New York City from a maniacal...
Um, excuse me?
Are those my eggs?
You kind of interrupted an incredible moment, but here, take that.
No, no, we can't be seen together.
Gina, did you know about this?
Uh, tricking you was the only way I could get you to talk to him.
Plus, you know I heart intrigue.
Sir, take a look at these photos.
None of the victims had any alcohol in their apartments.
Not even a dusty bottle.
You want to know why?
Because they were all sober.
They all attended 12-step programs.
None of them the same one, but they all have the same leader, a creep with a record of torturing animals.
I'm talking dogs.
I found the Oolong Slayer, and his name is...
I never do this, but I kind of ordered rye.
Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay?
I'm trying to blow my friend's mind over here.
Could someone get this lunatic some rye?
His name is James Dylan Borden, and he works the night shift at creep-a-palooza... the mannequin factory in Red Hook.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Are you insane?
We were just suspended for screwing up this case.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Wuntch can probably hear us right now.
She has super sonar hearing, because she's a bat.
Sir, we're tracking a serial killer.
There's nothing better.
We're living the dream.
That's your dream.
Mine was to run the nine-nine, and that will never happen again.
Just give the case to major crimes.
Wow.
Never thought I'd live to see Holt side with the vulture and Wuntch.
Mark the day, Gina.

Oh, honey.
We're well into October.

Hey, Charles.
I thought you should know.
I heard what you said, and it really sank in.
I'm off the nibs.
Really?
Of course.
I'm Terry Jeffords, and when I put my mind to something, I do it.
[chuckles]
My resting heart rate is six.
Six, Boyle.
You know, the rest of you could learn a little something from me.
Sure, sometimes we fall down, but it's how we back up that matters.
We need to look our failings in the eye and say, ""Not today, not today, nibs.""
[chuckles]
Oh, sergeant.
Fine!
I'm not better.
These nibs are just too damn delicious.
I don't think the nibs being too yummy is the problem.
I think right now, there's too much on your plate... metaphor intended.
You're stress eating.
That's even worse!
The stress isn't going anywhere.
I'm about to have my third kid, and they just get more stressful over time, man.

Good morning, Boyle.
It's Halloween... I'm surprised you didn't put on a costume.
I was going to, sir, but then I decided, ""screw that jazz.""
Well, I'm the only one who ever dresses up, no one ever gets my costume, and they make fun of me... so I'm done.
These people don't deserve my dress-up gifts.
[elevator dings]
Charles, seriously?
No costume?
What the hell, Charles?
Where's your Halloween spirit?
But you guys always make fun of me.
I have never once insulted you in my life, especially vis-à-vis your appearance.
Yeah, man, we always love your costumes.
Remember last year, when you came as that person and/or thing?
Yes, I do remember!
Sir, permission to sprint to my car and get my emergency costume?
Does it matter if I say no?
No!
A-bam, bam, boom.
What the... what...
Why are you dressed up? You look like an idiot.
But... but...
Yeah, what are you supposed to be, a sassy car mechanic?
No, come on... he's clearly the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot, Harry Pop-Tart.
I am not! You know who I am!
Squad, that's enough... you're making Boyle feel bad on purpose.
He's Elvis.
Yes!
Elvis Stojko, the Canadian figure skater.
No!
Attention, squad: today is the most important day in the history of this precinct.
For today is Halloween...
I thought we were going to say it together.
I never agreed to that.
All right.
As you may know, for the past two years, Captain Holt and I have engaged in an epic battle of wits.
The goal: to determine who must call the other an amazing detective/genius.
The first year, by sheer, dumb luck, Jake eked out a feeble victory.
And last year, I let the captain win, because he's old an sad.
Sad because the competition was so dismal.
Is this meaning about something?
It's about everything.
This year's the tie-breaker, a final heist to decide once and for all the true king of the nine-nine.
Halloween Heist III: The Heistening. Tagline?
This year we both attempt to steal the same object instead of Jake attempting to steal one from me.
I gave you one direction on the tagline... snappy.
But yes, we will be attempting to steal the same item... this.
The crown will be locked in this briefcase, which in turn will be locked in the interrogation room.
♪ And so unto the briefcase goes the crown ♪
Didn't sing it with me.
We will need help, so to be fair, we're holding a draft.
The captain and I have given up our overtime, so everyone who participates will get the night off... captain?
With the first pick of the draft, I choose...
Terry.
Okay, brawns over brains.
All right, I take Charles.
I get it. Close friend.
I pick Gina.
Gina?
I take Rosa.
What?
Okay, all right. Well, Captain... that leaves me with you.
Let's do this.
Hang on, Santiago.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
You're Peralta's paramour; maybe you should be on his team.
No, no, no... Amy would do anything to win your approval, including pretending to be in a relationship with me for the past few weeks only to betray me now.
Jake, you are majorly overthinking this.
Maybe, but it's a risk I'm not willing to take.
You're not on my team, Amy.
Yeah, Amy's out.
By midnight, whoever has the crown will be the king of the nine-nine.
Uh, Hitchcock and I still haven't been chosen.
I'm good.
Me too.
So, I see you've been assigned to guard the briefcase too.
Yup, I'm not supposed to let it or you out of my sight, if that even is you.
Ow, that's my face!
Oh, sorry... I thought it was a cheap, rubber mask.
Well, I have exciting news.
I found the perfect guy to set you up with.
After zero consideration, I'm happy to say, ""hard pass.""
Come on, our parents are married.
Genevieve and I are dating.
I want you to have someone too.

You shouldn't have to slow-dance alone after family dinner.
How did my life come to this?

I have spectacular taste in men.
You would love Nadia.
His name is Nadia?
Oh, all of a sudden Nadia's not a cool name?
You are impossible.

Got it.
Hey, Jake. Can we talk?
Yeah.
You really hurt my feelings by leaving me off your team.
Oh, I had no idea you felt that way.
Well, it doesn't feel great to be left out.
Right, totally, I get it. I'm sorry...

What? Why are you yelling at my boobs?
Because that's where the camera is.
Nice try, Ray-Ray!
There's no camera, Jake.

Okay fine... if you're telling the truth, then I sincerely apologize.
But since you're not, I will defeat you!

Ahhh! Gah! Scary witch!
Scary, so scary!
Amy, don't feel bad.

No, I'm not part of this.
Oh, of course not.
Neither am I. Wink.

I'm going to meet him in an illegal dance competition in an abandoned subway tunnel.

Alternately, he could win an illegal street race in which my love is the prize.
Oh, my God! Gina, look! Roaches!

Look!
Ew, Charles, kill them with whatever cologne you're wearing!
No, I can't! They're moving too fast!
I can't kill them! It's pandemonium!
If I die, turn my Tweets into a book!
Commence operation, ""Oh crap, wrong vent.""
[gasp]
Oh crap, wrong vent.
This was a mistake.
Nice try, losers. You blew it.
Yeah, we totally blew it.
And all because Boyle marked the wrong vent.
It's not my fault... I thought it was the right vent.
Unbelievable, mister.
You are, mister.
I'm having trouble even believing you at all right now.
That is the last time I let Charles mark a vent.
I'm normally great at marking vents.
Lock picked.
Never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, will I ever, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, never, never... I forgive you, and good-bye.
Wow, you should have seen us, Rosa.
Charles and I were amazing.
I somersaulted through a window, cut the crown out of a briefcase, and replaced everything in under a minute.
Yeah, I guess you helped a little.
But our fake argument was super convincing.
And all of a sudden, we had to make it longer, and we did.
Anyways, now all we gotta do is guard this drawer until midnight, and the best part about it is Captain Holt has absolutely no idea.
He is such a fool.
Yes, I'm the fool.
You fool.
So we wanted Jake to take the crown?
Sergeant, are you familiar with the Hungarian fencing term, Hosszú Gorcs?
You must realize my answer is no.
It's a strategy of letting your opponent win points early to give them a sense of overconfidence, thus exposing a much easier target for you later.
You think he's overconfident enough?
I'm the smartest man alive.
I'm never gonna die.
[knocks on door]
Sir, do you have a minute?
Of course.
Jeffords, we'll rendezvous later.
Sir, I want to talk about Jake.
Okay...
Amy! Help!
Our foot fungus heist has gone sideways!
Hitchcock, not now.
Scully doesn't know I'm in here.
I stole his foot cream, but then I lost it.
Amy, you're the only hope I have of finding it.
You're a detective.
You're a detective! Get out of here!
Go! [sighs]
Sir, Jake really pissed me off, and I want to help you take him down.
Well, that's an intriguing proposition.
You certainly could be useful...
Thank you.
To Jake!
I got you, Peralta! You're not fooling anyone!
Why does everyone think that's where a camera would be?
Because the cleavage cloaks the camera with its curves.
That will be all, spy.
Sorry I said cleavage.
Mm-hmm.
Charles, that is so nasty you put cockroaches in your pants.
When you say it like that, yeah.
But Jake made it sound so cool.
How?
[knocks on door]
Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone.
Come in, Nadia.
Hey, Charles.
What up, bro?
Gina, this was the boy I was telling you about.
You're Nadia?
Well, my real name's Leo; Nadia's just my tag.
I don't love it, but when Banksy gives you a nickname, it just sticks.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
This isn't a setup... this is a setup.
And all of this is supposed to distract me from the heist.
The heist?
[mocking tone] The heist?
You shut your hot lips.
Charles, I don't buy it.
This is an obvious trap, okay?
Who are you, really, hmm?
You some male prostitute that Charles busted out on some lonely pier somewhere?
Well, guess what, sweetie?
This is one trick you ain't gonna be turning tonight.
I'm not a prostitute.
Okay.
[laughs]
Right. Bye-bye, whore.
It's go time, Sergeant.
Hey, Rosa.
I'm not saying these are from your motorcycle, but I found these stripped handlebars outside.
You better not have messed with my bike for this heist.
Let me remind you I'm carrying a weapon.
We all have the same weapons.
Damn, Rosa! Where'd you get that?
The scorpion has left the nest.
♪ ♪
And...
Ding.
[elevator dings]
See Daddy? Come on.
Time for the twin twist.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, you guys.
We wanted to surprise Terry; have you seen him?
Oh, he just went downstairs for a bit, but he should be back soon.
Oh. Cagney? Lacey?
Do you guys want to take a picture with Uncle Jake?
Yeah!
[laughs]
You don't mind, do you?
Um... no, of course not.
That would be so fun.
What if we do it in the briefing room, like you're assigning them a case?
No, I mean, you know what would be fun... even more that that... is if we took a picture right here, and I could have my hand on this cabinet.
Okay.
Nailed it.
Here we go.
Oh, God, it was in video mode... sorry.
Take your time; I could do this all day.
Matter of fact, what if we did one where I had both hands on the cabinet... one on top, and then one on the front?
Looks good, yeah.
All right, smile... three, two, one...
Cheese! Very good.
Great, you guys. Let's go find Daddy.
[witch cackling]
What's going on?
Aha! What are you doing?
Nothing... just enjoying a taste of my favorite beverage, the soda pop.
Really? I have never seen you enjoy soda pop before.
Hmm.
Have some now.
Ahh.
It's delicious.
I don't buy it.
You're making the same face you made when you found a chocolate chip in your trail mix.
Something's up. I'm patting you down.
Damn it, nothing but a surprisingly toned set of abs.
Why would I have the crown, Jake?
Isn't it still in the interrogation room?
Yes. Yes. Of course.
Of course it's still in there.
Welp, I guess I'll see you at midnight.
After you.
No, after you.
I insist.



[witch cackling]
Ugh.
You drank a soda?
Not sure that's the worst thing in the world.
It was the worst thing in the world... worse than a fruit-forward Riesling.
No, I'm not exaggerating.
Anyhow, I cleverly ditched the crown in a trash can... wait a minute... so as to not arouse suspicion and then retrieve it.
Got it.
Hey... while I'm in there, should I get you a soda?
I know you're joking, but on the off chance you aren't...
No.
Hi, there.
Oh, is it?
The handlebar thing was fake.
They were trying to distract me.
I think they made a play for the crown.
I know, but I had my hand on the cabinet the whole time, so I'm pretty confident there's no way they could have gotten it.
They got it.
Look at the back. Screws are loose.
Damn it. That son of a bitch is good.
Sir, we got a problem.
The crown wasn't in the trash can.
Jake must have taken it back.
Damn it.
That son of a bitch is good.
We have to get that crown back.
I already changed my email to ""kingjakerulez"" with a z.
Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot.
Hello, Peralta.
Captain.
Midnight nears.
Yes, it does.
Tick tock.
Tick tock indeed.
But tick tock for who?
You know it's ""for whom.""
Don't try to provoke me.
I didn't know that.
Both: I'm going to get that crown back.
Wait... what?
Huh?
Will you excuse me for just one moment?
Yes, I too need to be excused.
[whispering] He doesn't have the crown!
Why you asked that?
I don't know who has it.
What do we do?
Pull the security tape. I'll distract them.
Hey, look at this.
Ahhhhhhhhhh.
Damn it, how did that not work?
Hmm, Captain Holt said you guys stole the crown when Jake came through the ceiling.
Yeah, I can't believe you fell for that.
You really think I'd mark the wrong vent?
I've never marked a wrong vent in my life.
You're very intense about vents.
Yeah.
Wait... so Nadia wasn't just a distraction?
No, 100% real.
Handsome, cool, hair as thick as a collie's.
I found you the perfect guy, and you drove him off.
Ugh. I'm sorry.
I should have trusted you.
Please call him and tell him I messed up.
Fine, but only if you agree that your first date will be a double date with me and Genevieve on a week-long trip to Turk's...
Forget it, no. Forget it.
No! Okay, I'll call him.
Please, I want this so badly.
Fine, you may call him for me.
Thank you.
Okay, here I am taking pictures with Terry's kids.
Man, I look so strong standing next to them.
Should I have kids?
Sure.
Okay.
It's Holt. Whoa, how did he do that?
Guy has an insane set of abs.
Oh, look, he's got the crown.
And he's headed to the break room.
He dumped it in the trash.
Did he go back and get it?
Nope, janitor came in and took it.
But which janitor?
Looks like I'm going to have to squint.
His name is Al... Al the janitor.
All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now; That means Al's long gone.
How are we going to get his home address?
Who's the one person you know who's a**l enough to send out holiday cards to every single employee?
Amy!
What do you want, Jake?
What? Why would you assume that I want anything?
What I want is to apologize to my girlfriend, who I hurt.
It's ""whom.""
Why does the word ""who"" even exist if you're not allowed to say it?
Anyways, now that I've apologized and you've accepted, can you give me janitor Al's address?
This is related to your heist, isn't it?
No, no. It's about a crime.
I think janitor Al is going to kill the president.
Oh, Santiago. There's my protégé.
Let me guess... you want the janitor's address.
Janitor? Address? Al?
I never said his name.
Well, isn't this rich.
After being excluded by both of you, here I am with the power to decide who wins and who loses your little heist.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
You are my wisest detective.
Pathetic. She can't be manipulated, sir.
Amy, we are in love.
I know we've never said it before, but I think this is the perfect time, don't you?
Love? Ha.
What's love compared to the respect of a workplace superior?
Amy Santiago, will you m...
Enough!
Okay.
Pretending to be nice to me is worse than being mean.
You know what? You want the address?
Here, you can both have it.
[cell phones ringing]
Hope you're happy, you selfish monsters.
I feel terrible.
We should apologize.
Yes, I agree.
You definitely should now; I'll do mine later.
Fat chance.
Charles, I need your butt. Meet me downstairs.
Alpha Team, this is the Golden Sparrow.
Rendezvous at Drop Zone Yankee.
When did you come up with those code names?
Okay, he lives on the sixteenth floor.
I think we beat Holt here.
Or did you?
I'll get the elevator.
Crap! Looks like we're taking the stairs.
All right, it's sixteen floors... pace yourselves.
Forget it. Run as fast as you can!
[panting]
[knocks] Ha ha!
I win. I knocked first.
You're not Al.
You're looking for Al?
Of course we're looking for Al, you imbecile!
Sorry.
He's having a cigarette on the roof.
The roof?
[panting]
Yes. I did it.
I am the greatest athlete in the world.
[vomits]
Al? Al?
Where's Al?
Oh, there he is. There he is!
I did it. I did it.
[vomits]
Good God.
Are you Al the janitor?
Nope. I'm your worst nightmare.
Amy Santiago.
Oh, no.
I don't understand what is happening.
Allow me to explain.
Amy and I were ahead of you the whole time.
No, you weren't part of this.
Get back over to the loser side, loser.
All right. Worth a shot.
So how'd you pull it off?
Well, it all started when I went to tell Jake how badly he hurt my feelings, and he yelled at my breasts.
Oh, boy, I am not going to come off well in this story.
Nope.
Remember when you set off the witch?
[witch cackling]
You made Captain Holt flinch, which was weird, since his door was closed, but not weird, since he actually heard it over a bug he planted at your desk.
It was in an old muffin that you never threw in the trash.
That's why people throw away garbage.
How are we together?
Eh.
Anyway, I tapped into the bug's frequencies, so I had ears on Jake.
I needed to know what Holt was up to.
That's where Hitchcock came in.
I masterminded the entire plan.
You did one small thing, and I had to explain it to you, like, 45 times.
He left a tiny crack in the blind, so I could read the Captain's lips.
""Sharon and your kids will distract Jake.
""They'll be here at 9:30 sharp.
My waffle xylophone on the cheese man.""
What?
My lip-reading is not flawless.
Now that I knew your plan, it was simple to disrupt.
While Scully gracefully moved the witch, I got into character.
Holt triggered the witch, which brought Jake into the room.
And I threw the crown in the trash can.
Exactly as I planned.
Then I sent you all here, placed an out-of-order sign on the perfectly functional elevator, made you all walk up 31 flights of stairs and vomit twice.
Actually, it was four times, if you count all the stairwell stuff.
You thought I was just Holt's lackey.
And you thought I was just Jake's girlfriend.
Well, I'm my own person, capable of making my own decisions, and I decided to humiliate you both.
Well, you did, and it was awesome.
One last question: where's the crown?
Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar, the official site of my coronation.
All hail the crown of destiny.
[cheers]
And all hail she who wears it, Amy Santiago, the...
Queen.
Queen of the nine-nine.
[cheers]
I believe there's something else you both need to say.
Gladly.
Both: Amy Santiago is an amazing detective/genius.
Drinks are on us.
Nope.
Drinks are on me.
Yeah!
Hey.
I'm glad you showed up.
Sorry I was acting so weird earlier.
Hey, I don't blame you. Sagittarius, right?
With Saturn where it is, you're right to be wary of new relationships.
How is it possible that a spirit such as yourself even knows Charles?
I did an art show at Genevieve's gallery.
Oh, right... so you're not really friends, you know his girlfriend through the art world.
Yeah, plus, she's my twin sister.
What?
Hi, Leo. A kiss for my bro.
And a kiss for my beau.
No.
A kiss for my beau.
And a kiss for my sis.
No!

[suspenseful music]
Falcon one, do we have a go?
The light is green, tiger one.
What are you gonna say when you crash through the window?
Hey, there, sorry for dropping in.
Goose bumps, Jake. Goose bumps.
Is the equipment secure?
Check.
Weapon loaded?
Check.
Did you have breakfast?
What? That's not on the checklist.
I added it because I care about you.
No, I did not have breakfast.
Unacceptable.
Look in your pocket.
Hey, there's little chocolate chips in this.
Yeah, I'm not an idiot. I know how to trick my best friend into eating his fiber.
All right, bar digested. Mission go.
♪ ♪
[dramatic music]
NYPD!
Stay where you are!
Hands in the air where I can see 'em!
Hey, there, sorry for dropping in.
Was it cool? It felt really cool.
Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty cool.
Pretty cool? What went wrong?
Nothing.
You have fudge on cheek.
Oh, from the breakfast bar, Boyle!
♪ ♪
So I smash through the window, feet first.
There's glass everywhere, and I say, ""Hey, there, sorry for dropping in.""
Ho!
Whoa.
And the best part is, there was nothing on my cheek.
That's a weird detail to throw in there.
You're a weird detail to throw in there.
Hmm? What?
Wait a second, Peralta.
You busted through a window for no reason?
Basic police tactic, Sarge. Cover every exit.
It was a sealed window on the fifth floor.
You could have just gone in the door with Charles.
Yeah, but then what would my catchphrase have been?
""Knock, knock, who's there? Justice""?
Ooh, that's actually amazing.
Charles, write that down.
Already did.
Sarge, what's the big deal?
We stopped two kilos of heroin from hitting the streets.
Who cares about one broken window?
I do!
I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.
But... Terry loves paperwork?
No, Jake, I do not.
Oh.
Look, man, I've got two kids, a job, and a very pregnant wife.
I get one hour a week to myself on Sundays.
You know what I do with that time?
I run a hot bubble bath, wheel in a TV, and watch sports bloopers.
Sports bloopers?
They're hilarious and relaxing, and they humanize my heroes.
Okay, well, I went through a window.
That's a blooper of sorts, right?
No!
It's not a blooper if you meant to do it!
Thanks for ruining my weekend.
This is a debacle.
Oh, man. Sarge is pissed.
What are we gonna do, Jake?
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.
We just have to turn this debacle into a straight-up ""bacle.""
Guess I should be getting back.
Uncle Ray, thank you for loaning me you best detective for lunch.
My pleasure.
Of course, she is entitled to 45 minutes as per her union contract.
Okay, well, great to see you.
Bye, baby.
A minute, Detective Diaz.
What's going on with you and Marcus?
What are you talking about?
Your shoulders tightened when he said ""baby.""
Your nostrils flared when I asked what was going on with the two of you.
And you have saag paneer on your sleeve, which, given your aversion to Indian cuisine, suggests you let him choose the restaurant.
Why would you do that?
Kindness.
Pity.
You're about to break up with him.
Damn, you are good.
Mm-hmm.
Things aren't working out.
I don't want to talk about it.
I regret the words we've already spoken.
Listen, I know I probably shouldn't get involved, but Marcus is my nephew, and I hope you'll let him down gently.
Don't worry.
I don't want things to be awkward.
I'm gonna send him a text while he's sleeping that says, ""We're done.""
Clear. Accurate.
But do you feel like it's enough?
""We're done.
Good-bye.""
Yes. That should do it.
What's going on, Peralta?
Charles says you're going to make me happier than I was on my wedding night.
Well, that's not how I would have put it, but I know you were mad at me for ruining blooper time, so I did all your paperwork.
That's not helpful.
You always make a thousand mistakes.
Mm-hmm, that's what Amy said as well right before she took over for me, so it's perfect.
Okay. Hey, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
And I spoke with Sharon.
I spoke with Captain Holt.
And we all agree that you deserve a break.
So this weekend, Charles and I are taking you to the great outdoors to Detective Lohank's cabin.
Boom. Suck it, wedding night.
Lohank? That sad sack?
All he does is talk about his wife sleeping with other men.
No, he also has some great stories about his prostate cancer.
Besides, he's not sticking around.
It's just the three of us.
Those woods are full of ticks.
It's Lyme disease central.
So we'll get some bug spray.
Plus that cabin's probably covered in black mold.
Racist.
You know what?
I am gonna stay home and have a blooper bath.
Oh, come on, Sarge.
It's gonna be fun.
You remember fun, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. It's just... I planned this awesome guys' weekend for us, and all you can think about is Lyme disease.
Untrue.
I'm thinking about all tick-borne diseases... anaplasmosis, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
You know, maybe I could just chill out a little.
Yes. You're stressed.
A little fun would do you good, I promise.
You know what? You're right.
You all better get ready for fun Terry.
Ooh, fun Terry. He sounds fun.
Oh, he's crazy.
Thanks for planning this, Jake.
No, thank you for being amazing and also for driving us up to the cabin.
My car's in the shop, and riding in Charles's is like sitting inside of a dog's behonkus.
Fun Terry. Can't wait.
Hey, Gina. Would you do me a favor?
Yes, thank you for asking.
I did not feel like doing this work right now.
Oh, those look like important papers.
What's up? How can I help?
Well, when I was a kid, I invented a magnetic flashlight clip so I could read under the covers.
This clip and I went all around the world together... the Shire, Sweet Valley High, Terabithia.
But never to a friend's house, huh?
Uncalled for.
Anyway, I realized that this could be really helpful for police work, so I made an appointment with the head of NYPD purchasing.
I have to sell him on it, but I'm afraid I might come across a little boring.
[gasps] Amy, are you asking me to ""She's All That"" you?
I didn't read that.
But if it's about helping out a friend, then yes.
Please ""She's All That"" me.
Okay.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way, all right?
First I'm going to need to break you down to nothing and then build you back up piece by piece.
Well, the meeting's tomorrow.
Well, we'll just break you down to nothing and see what time it is.
Mmm! What is that smell?
That is the absence of urine.
You got to leave Brooklyn to get that.
No urine... I could get used to this.
Oh, yes.
And that's just the beginning, my friend.
Just wait till you're sitting fireside, sipping on a premium Chinese Scotch, and smoking a sweet Rwandan cigar.
Okay. Okay.
I probably could have done without the countries of origin, but that sounds great.
Yeah.
What else do you have planned?
Oh, so much. I'm talking fishing.
I'm talking poker. I'm talking Frisbee.
Boyle, what else am I talking?
Wildflower picking so we can make our own cologne.
Nope, I was talking bonfires and s'mores, but that's my fault for throwing to you.
This is going to be fun as hell.
This is going to be the best weekend ever!
Welcome to Stink Puddle Manor.
Stink Puddle?
Manor.
Just out of curiosity, why would you name your house Stink Puddle?
Oh, I didn't.
The home inspector came up with it.
I can't smell anything since the radiation therapy.
Another great story, eh?
So there's no power, no heat.
Is there running water?
Of course there's running water.
Oh, but I wouldn't use it.
It's very contaminated.
We had three dogs die in the well.
Three?
If they weren't all tied together, we might have just lost the one.
Sad thing is, they were therapy dogs for my son.
Oh.
He had real abandonment issues after my wife left.
It was kind of like an emotional scar on an emotional scar.
But the woods are super nice, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Gorgeous.
Except during sinkhole season.
When's sinkhole season?
It's been going on for, like, 20 years now.
It's kind of like a ""Game of Thrones"" winter.
Right. Yeah.
Anyway, I'll leave you guys to it.
Have fun.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
For instance, drink the water or let your wife go on work trips.
Duly noted.
You wanted to see me?
I told Kevin about how I approved of your strategy for breaking up with Marcus, and he said that we were ""sociopaths.""
So you're gonna leave him?
No, I think he may have a point.
You might need to do more than simply text.
A long, drawn-out breakup is just gonna end in a big scene and Marcus crying.
He has so many emotions.
[sobbing]
It's just so beautiful how much they love each other.
It's a commercial for a refrigerator.
Yes, it is daunting.
But I did some research on amicable breakups.
I visited www .ladiesgoodhealthmag.com/ 6-relationships/867599904/ 9432&20.html.
Do you know that site?
No.
Well, apparently, it's less painful if you acknowledge the dumpee's feelings.
Ew.
But don't worry.
We'll practice. Hmm?
I'll be Marcus. Go.
[clears throat]
Marcus, I think we should break up.
That makes me feel sad.
I am sad.
Your sadness is noted.
I feel acknowledged.
Thank you for breaking up with me.
It will take me eight minutes to collect my things.
I think that went very well.
Hmm.
Okay, creek.
I'd like three fresh trout to go, please.



[percussive music]
It just went straight up.
Now it's coming down. Oh, boy!
Watch and learn, losers.
Yah!
I didn't see where it went.
Back of my neck.
It's in the back of my neck. [groans]
Okay, I've learned from your mistakes.
Not too hard, late release, and...
[water splashes]
That was fun. Fishing was fun.
Yeah.
Back to the cabin?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Before we get into your pitch, what are you calling the product?
The Handless Lighting System, or HLS.
Sounds like a genetic disorder.
How's about Shoulder Nova?
I love it. Amazing.
It's perfect.
Now let's talk presentation.
What's your opener?
Hi, I'm Amy Santiago, and my product will make a real difference.
It is the Shoulder Nova.
My only note is, make it 1000% more captivating.
Very good note. Yeah.
Okay.
I got it. [clears throat]
Mm...
Ding.
Oh, hello. I'm Amy Santiago.
Was that captivating enough?
Weirdly, it might have been a scooch too captivating.
Here's what I'm thinking.
Mm-kay? You can take a seat.
Okay.
Until this moment, there was only darkness.
But now there is... light.
[sighs]
I am Vanessa Santiago, and I'm about to blow your minds.
You want me to change my name to Vanessa?
Desperately.
I got to say, the Chinese know how to make a terrible scotch.
They certainly do.
Ugh, it's bad. Gets you drunk, though.
Well, I found all the worms.
They're eating a fox corpse in the outhouse.
Speaking of which, I'm getting hungry.
What's for dinner?
Dinner?
[laughs nervously] Yes, of course. Dinner.
Did you not pack any food?
There's fresh fox.
Oh, it is not fresh.
Are you serious?
We stopped three times on the way up here to buy fireworks, and you never thought to get groceries?
What was in those coolers?
The fireworks.
Look, I thought we would be incredible at fishing.
Excuse me for believing in us.
It'll be okay, guys. No need to worry.
I just took a foraging class, and not to brag, I was voted Mr. Fungus.
Aha, Mr. Fungus to the rescue.
See, Sarge, everything's going to work out, and you don't have to stress all the time.
Boyle, you really think you can find us dinner?
[laughing] Um, let's just say it's gonna be a ""spore-gasbord.""
[percussive music]
Something bad happened to Charles, didn't it?
Big time.
Oh God, what if the last thing we ever heard him say was ""spore-gasbord?""
Charles! Charles!
I'm starting to get worried, Jake.
Relax.
If anybody can handle it out here, it's Charles.
He saw ""Into the Woods"" ten times in the theater.
Watch it. That's poison ivy.
Whoa. Good call.
I'm allergic to poison ivy.
I got it one time at sports camp, making out in the woods with Liz Almont.
Okay, fine. We weren't making out.
I was looking for my inhaler.
And it wasn't sports camp. It was asthma camp.
Hey, Jake. Are we lost?
What? No.
We're on an ""adventure.""
Right, Fun Terry?
Fun Terry's gone.
He starved to death an hour ago.
This is Original Terry.
That's the worst Terry.
You didn't bring a map or a flashlight or anything that could keep us from getting lost?
Yes, I brought all of those things.
It's called a cell phone.
Map. Flashlight. Compass.
An app that makes me sound like T-Pain.
Nope, the battery's dead. Now it's just a brick.
But don't freak out.
I don't need an app to sound like T-Pain, right?
[nasally] ♪ We're totally lost ♪
Yeah, that was a little more Kermit, but...
Oh, you're back.
How did the breakup go?
I tried to acknowledge his feelings.
It wasn't easy. There were a lot of them.
I'm just so confused.
So sad.
Are you climbing out the window?
No.
I climbed back in, and we talked about emotions for 20 minutes.
Dear God.
I know.
But I think it went well.
At least there was no crying.
Well done, Diaz.
I'm actually really glad you made me do it this way.
I got to tell him that even though it was ending, it was incredibly meaningful to me, and I'm gonna miss him.
Oh, no.
This is exactly what I didn't want.
You crying? Oof!
I deserved that.
Charles is dead, and we're next.
All right, don't be so melodramatic.
He's probably chewing on bark and berries, having the time of his life, safe and sound.
Terry! Jake!
Ho, ho! What's that I hear?
Charles Boyle, safe and sound?
What are you saying, Charles?
That you're having the time of your life?
I fell in a sinkhole, and I'm badly hurt!
Damn it!
Boyle, what the hell?
I know. It's a pretty big hole, right?
How'd you end up down there?
I spotted a gorgeous chanterelle.
I reached for it, but then I rolled my ankle and fell in.
All right, buddy, don't worry. We got you, okay?
I was so scared, you guys.
A psychic told me I was gonna die alone in a pit, and I kept telling myself, ""This is a hole, not a pit. This is a hole, not a pit. This is a hole, not a pit. This is a hole, not a pit. Charles, it's a hole, not a pit.""
All right. Here, grab me.
[grunts]
Take my hand, all right?
Okay.
Okay, now pull us up, Terry.
Oh crap, I'm slipping!
[all yell]
[groaning]
No, it's Lohank's dogs all over again!
So in conclusion, by eliminating flashlight fumbling, the Shoulder Nova could save the average police officer over 13,000 seconds.
Wow, that sounds like a lot, Vanessa.
It is.
I guess there's only one thing left to do.
Both: You have the right to remain...
Uhh!
Both: Well lit!
[clapping]
Wow, that presentation was terrific.
So fun to watch.
Thank you, sir.
See, the problem is the product.
I just don't see any need for it at all.
I just put the flashlight in my mouth when my hands are full.
Sir, the human mouth is nasty.
Yeah, but mouths are free.
I'm sorry. I'm just not interested.
Okay. Thank you for your time.
You are scum.
[scraping]
This isn't working.
Great trip, Jake.
Oh, thanks, man.
You know that was sarcastic!
How?
You didn't bring food or water or ask if Lohank's cabin was straight out of a horror movie.
Now you got us trapped in a pit!
Hole.
Okay, I know that things are not looking great right now, but you have to admit, you were having fun earlier.
I'm not now. I'm more stressed than ever.
Maybe that's 'cause you're just focusing on the negative, Ter-bear. I mean, look at Charles.
He's chill. I'm chill.
That's 'cause he's in shock! You know what?
The reason you're so chill is because you have everyone cleaning up your messes for you.
Didn't bring food? Charles will find mushrooms.
Smashed through a window? Terry'll do the paperwork.
Hey, I did the paperwork.
No, Amy did it!
Oh, guys, please, please calm down.
I hate it when you argue.
It reminds of when my dad used to fight with my best friend... my mom.
I'm done with this.
I'm going to sleep.
Charles, spoon with me.
We need to huddle together for warmth.
No, Charles, you're my best friend.
You're going to spoon with me.
I called first spoon.
Charles, get over here right now.
Boyle, don't throw away a lifelong friendship for a one-night spoon with Terry.
Okay, enough. We're gonna stop fighting.
We're gonna lie down, and we're gonna triple-spoon like grown-ups!
Come on, bring it in. Bring it in.
[dramatic music]
There, okay.
See, that's better, right?
So do we know any songs?
Both: Shut up, Charles!
[percussive music]
Jake? Where's Jake?
Did you eat him, Terry?
No!
Good morning, guys!
How'd you get out of the pit?
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.
Actually, it took me hours.
I tied all my clothes together, tethered them to a log, and used it as a grappling hook.
Managed to snag it in a root.
Aren't you freezing?
Not at all.
Mainly because my skin is on fire from all the poison ivy in this tree.
[giggles]
Why'd you do that?
Oh, let me guess. Dumb mistake.
No, dumb choice.
I didn't want to sit around and wait for somebody to clean up my mess.
Hmm, I guess I got through to you.
Yeah.
Also, after you fell asleep, Boyle really laid into me.
It was brutal.
I got to say, Jake, this time, I think you're only 99% right.
[gasps]
We're rolling.
No!
Argh!
[groans]
Well, can you see anything from up there?
Yes, I can...
Stink Puddle Manor, about 65 trees sunward.
Man, one day in the woods, and I'm freakin' Lewis and Clark up here.
[door rattles]
Thank you for coming, Diaz.
I want to apologize for yesterday.
Inserting myself into my employee's breakup with my nephew somehow, uh, backfired.
It's not your fault.
I'm the one that made a scene like a dumb, crying baby.
I'm considering having my tear ducts melted shut.
It's not the end of the world to feel... things.
I guess not.
It's up there.
The thing is, I really care about Marcus, but he wanted to get married, and I'm just not ready for that.
And if I'm not ready with a guy as great as Marcus, then what if I'm never ready?
[voice breaking] What if that was it, my one chance at love?
What if I never get a second chance?
I don't know. I'm just...
I'm just sad.
Well, I understand.
It must be very difficult.
Wait, are you crying?
Yes.
[sighs]
Thank you for acknowledging my feelings.
Thank you for acknowledging mine.
[both sobbing]
We're both great at this.
[sobs and sniffles]
Hey, sport.
You look a little D in the D.
D for ""down in dumps,"" respectively.
Probably easier to just not abbreviate if you have to explain it.
Agree to D.
I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.
Yeah, thank you for all your help with the presentation.
And I'm sorry you had to waste your talent on such a stupid product.
Without product makers like you, us dazzle-doves wouldn't have nothing to shake our wings over.
Yeah, but my invention was useless.
No, that scum was wrong.
I showed the Shoulder Nova to a girl in my building.
She's like a mini Amy, and she loved it.
She said she was gonna break the world record for speed-reading.
Psh! Yeah.
Like some little girl's gonna take down Yuri Jurgonav.
[both laugh]
Anyway, I know it wasn't what you wanted, but you still made a difference.
Thanks, Gina.
I guess I did make a D.
Don't steal my thing.
Okay.
That's all I ask.
I won't.
Hey, Sarge.
Why'd you want us to meet you out here?
To thank you guys for the weekend.
Really? It was a total disaster.
Not a total disaster.
None of us got sick from that dog water.
You drank that?
No.
Look, Jake, you were right.
I have kind of forgotten how to have fun.
I'm going to try to work on that, so...
[gasps]
The fireworks you made me surrender when we reentered New York!
Uh-huh. Fun Terry's back.
We're gonna set 'em off in a big pile, all at once.
By shooting our guns at them?
What? No.
No.
We're going to set 'em off like normal people.
Oh. That's good too.
Ooh.
[fuse crackling]
Here we go.
[fireworks popping] Whoo-hoo!
[fireworks crackling and whistling]
See how fun this is?
Original Terry would have been worried that we're standing too close and need safety goggles, and he would have been absolutely right.
We're way too close. Run!

Yes, that's very cool, Scully.
Mm-hmm.
Will you excuse me just one moment?
Oh, sure.
Guys, guys, guys!
Scully has a mason jar full of lemonade.
You called us in here to tell us that?
No, I called you in here to change your lives!
For, you see, a mere five minutes ago, Hitchcock introduced me to his new goldfish, who lives in...

An identical mason jar!
Oh, this isn't gonna end well.
There are two possible outcomes, and we're going to bet on which one happens first.
So, will Hitchcock put fish food in Scully's lemonade, or will Scully drink Hitchcock's goldfish?
Now, you would think that putting fish food into lemonade...
Hitchcock just drank his own fish.

Yup. Your CI was right.

Oh. So what do you say?
Shall we take this partnership from the sheets to the streets?
Ooh, our first case as a couple.

All right. I'll take one.
Now, go sell your candy to everyone else, stupid.
Hey, hey, hey. You can't call a kid stupid.

Terry, this is Sam, my little brother from Brooklyn's Big Brothers.
I think it's funny when she calls me stupid.
No one cares, stupid.
Screw you, Rosa.
Sam's selling candy to pay for his basketball uniforms.
He's a forward. I taught him how to elbow.
Cool?
Now, go home and do all your homework, or I will end you.
Don't let Rosa fool you.

It's called ""taxi"" because it's yellow, and it takes you where you need to be.
Drug dealers have gotten so creative.
It used to just be ""crack,"" and then they'd be like, ""Hey, we got a new one. What are we gonna call this?""
And they'd go, ""I don't know, crank?""
This is certainly worth following up on.
Santiago, take Boyle, and work the case.
Oh, but Jake... I mean, Detective Peralta brought in the perp, so...
Good point.
Peralta and Boyle can work the case.
Actually, sir, I think we were kind of hoping we could work the case together.
Oh, are you two no longer...
Smooshing booties?
Yes, that's exactly how I was gonna finish my sentence.

We are still dating.
It's all above board.

Coming on a little strong there, buddy... and I'm digging it.
How much to take this bad boy home?
Actually, that's one of our more reasonable models.
Oh. Holy Moses!
That is much too much money.
Well, you spent twice that for Mr. Met to come to your birthday party.
Yeah, and it was worth it.
Mr. Met used my bathroom. Number two.
That's a memory I will cherish forever.
Look, mattresses are expensive, but they're an investment.
It's gonna be in your life for a long time.
True, but it's also still just a mattress, you know?
It's a lot of money to spend on a rectangle that's filled with springs and goose hair.
You know it's feathers.
I didn't.
And it would be money well spent, because it would allow me to actually sleep in your bed.
But I already have a mattress.
It just doesn't seem worth it.
Okay, well, to me, it sounds like you're saying I'm not worth it.
So I'm gonna go sleep in my grown-up mattress that I bought this century, and you're not invited.

But I do know this: I have reached the end of my sentence.
Oh, my God. Did that work?
Not at all.
Oh.
I can't believe you let a personal argument derail your investigation.
I would characterize it more as a professional police disagreement.
I listened to the tape.
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, then you know that it was a straight-up crazy bitch fight.
Look; I know we screwed up the case, and I'm sorry.
But if it's any consolation, I think we also screwed up our relationship.
Peralta, have a seat.
I believe this might help.
When Kevin and I first started dating, he taught at a small college upstate.
It was two hours away by train or bus, but only 30 minutes by car.
Is this another one of your riddles?
You rode to work on his shoulders.
One set of footprints. No?
No.
Okay.
Neither of us owned a car, and I didn't want to buy one because that would mean admitting that I cared for Kevin.
He had the same fear, and so visits were rare, and I was miserable.
Then one spring day, Kevin showed up at my door having purchased Gertie.
He took the leap, and I'm so grateful that he did.
I only regret that I didn't do it first.
Do you understand?
Absolutely.

Uh-oh.
That sounds ominous, like you went all Ms. Miriam on him.
I let him off with a warning.
See, thing about Ms. Miriam is she made me a good dancer, but she ruined my childhood.
She was constantly riding me about my posture and my technique and my pink hair.
Pink hair.
Never speak of that.
Copy.
She's the reason I quit ballet, and I sure as hell don't want Sam to quit the Big Brother program 'cause of me.
This is totally how I thought this Ms. Miriam thing was gonna go.
Another flawless Terry plan.
Boyle, I thought you should know.
I just got Gertie back from the garage.
She looks as good as new.
Better, even, because after 12 years, they finally got the Annie Lennox cassette out of the tape player.
Oh, I love her.
Here's a check for the full amount.
You don't owe me anything.
It was my fault, and I behaved poorly, as Gina made abundantly clear.
Oh, speaking of, you still owe me $14 for that cupcake.
Hey.
Hey.
What's up?
Two things.
I ran the footage from the hotel through facial recognition software and got a match: Grady Lamont.
This is his current address.
That's good, I guess.
Yeah, it's six years old.
Well, druggies are lazy?
He deals in uppers.
We're screwed.
Yup.
What's the second thing?
Well, the Captain and I were jamming on some personal issues, just going back and forth.
I honestly think I helped him more than he helped me.
I'm not buying any of that.
No.
[sighs]
Amy Santiago... I want to change mattresses for you.
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
I think I was just scared that you were gonna realize you're way better than me.
Like, you're Orangina, and I'm orange soda.
Are you kidding?
You're Orangina.
Ugh.
Don't say that.
Look.
I was scared too.
I'm gonna call my mom tonight.
Okay.
Let's buy this baby.
Calling up the website, finding the mattress, adding to cart, signing in as ""guest""...
That is not an option.
Creating an account...
You don't have to buy it right this second.
Nope, this is a big romantic gesture, and I'm nailing it.
Shipping address... not the same as billing address.
Got to enter both of those.
Jake, Jake, look! There's our guy.
Oh, perfect timing.
Submit order.
Province? Oh, no.
We're on the Canadian website.
Click on the American flag.
Jake!
Yeah.
We'll do this later. Let's go!

Cluck, cluck! Gobble, gobble!
Guess who just came from the P.S. 321 Thanksgiving Parade?
Charles, you actually might...
Who's Charles? I'm Tommy Gobbler.
And I'm stuffed with Thanksgiving happiness!
Gobble, gobble!
Seriously, Charles...
Uh-uh, I warned you!
I'm Tommy Gobbler, you silly pilgrim.
Okay, Tommy Gobbler.
There you go!
These are the Davidsons.
They want to know what happened to their missing grandmother.
I have some deeply tragic news for you.
♪ ♪
Listen up.
Diaz and I are going to Rikers to interview a guy we think has info on the Douglass Street murders.
Also, IT says the internet is down.
What? No!
I had just clicked a link that said Balloon Boy grew up hot.
Now I will never see those pictures.
Can't you just use the internet on your phone?
Bitch, you know I'm out of data.
Jake, can I speak to you for a minute?
In private.
Ooh, someone's in trouble.
It's me. I don't know why I did that.
So Sharon'll be here in an hour.
We're driving up to the Berkshires to spend one last weekend alone before the baby comes.
Yeah! Somebody's gonna get it!
She's 37 weeks pregnant, man.
We're gonna eat pie in bed.
Oh, yeah.
I just wanted to ask: If Sharon gets here before I'm back from Rikers, can you make sure she's comfortable?
And also, um...
Keep Captain Holt away from her.
Really? Why?
He's always weird around her and it stresses her out.
She says he reminds her of those judgmental trees from ""Lord of the Rings.""
[scoffs] They're called ""Ents.""
Get a life, dweeb.
I don't care.
Okay.
Can you handle it?
Yes, I can totally handle it.
I will take care of Sharon.
As long as she's carrying my godchild inside of her, I am her god-husband.
She is my god-wife.
And I will god-love her forever.
Come on, man.
Don't say stuff like that.
Which part? All of it?
I'm gonna assume it's all of it, and just make my exeunt.
Okay. Don't hurt me.
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
This year, I'm more thankful than ever to have you as my Captain.
And I'm thankful for the low price of gasoline.
And I'm thankful for the friendship...
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
There's no time for everyone to have a turn.
But I'm the only one that didn't get to...
Boyle.
Now, with the internet being down, we'll have to do all the paperwork by hand.
Would you two be okay with staying late tonight?
Well, I was gonna slow-cook a goose, but I guess I could normal cook her.
Great.
The bullpen is getting overcrowded, and I don't want the situation to deteriorate.
I'm sorry if this ruins your holiday.
Nonsense.
I'm thankful that you trust us with such an important task.
And I am thankful to have such a dedicated employee.
And I'm thankful...
Dismissed.
Yep.
Hey, Gina.
I need a top secret favor.
Sharon is coming to the precinct and I need your help.
Uh, it better not be pregnancy-related, 'cause that crap is nasty.
The miracle of life?
Dress it up however you want, that's some disgusting animal kingdom nonsense.
Okay, don't worry about Sharon.
I'll take care of her.
I've got everything she needs.
Pillow, blanket, copy of ""Breast-Feeders"" magazine... which, now that I say it out loud, sounds like p0rn.
Yep, it is.
So what do you need me for?
Keeping Captain Holt away from her.
Terry says he gets very awkward near Sharon.
Hmm. That's one way to put it.
Ah, Sharon. Nice to see you.
You look so big. Like a mighty truck.
I can help you avoid Captain Holt.
I'll keep you appraised of his location at all times.
Gina. Peralta.
He's behind me.
Yeah.
[thudding]
I love paperwork, but this is crazy.
There isn't even time to savor it.
Charles, you're going so fast.
I don't have a choice.
We can't let this place fill up with perps.
Yeah, but you're gonna cramp.
[chuckling] Are you kidding, baby?
I've been cramping for the past 20 minutes.
I'm so attracted to you right now.
[elevator door pings]
Sharon.
[claps] Mrs. Sarge, how are you?
Very pregnant.
Is Terry back yet?
Not yet, but he will be back any minute, and in the meantime, I will take great care of my godchild and my god-wife.
Oh, yes.
Terry did tell me that you might be calling me that.
Aww. You guys talk about me?
Sharon!
Hello.
Oh. Raymond. Hi.
Um, Captain, I need you to sign this here and here.
Excuse me, everyone.
We got to keep this area clear.
If you could all proceed in a wall-like fashion to the briefing room.
Oh, oh, oh...
That's it.
Also, right here.
Human blockade style.
And here, and here, and here.
Uh, give me one second, Gina, I just want to say hi to Sharon.
Just, um...
Sharon is gone.
Gina?
Is also gone.
Well, Sharon is happy, and Captain Holt has no idea where she is.
Damn, we are good at stashing pregnant ladies.
Guys?
My water just broke.
Don't worry about that, we'll just get you another one.
Oh, you mean your body water!
That's much worse.
Okay, Terry.
I love you. Just hurry back.
I love you too, baby.
Put Jake on, okay?
Hey there, Sarge.
Everything is totally under control.
As you know, her water broke and she's had a couple of contractions.
And... hey, Sharon, how are you doing vaginally?
What?
Don't ask her that!
Okay.
Jake, all you have to do is keep her comfortable.
I'm on my way.
Okay, sounds good.
And do you want to just meet us at the hospital or...
both: No hospital!
Okay. Got it. Got it.
Cool, cool, cool. No hospital.
I am picking up what you're screaming down.
We had a terrible experience when Cagney and Lacey were born.
Last time we went to the hospital, they pushed me to have a C-section, didn't have enough rooms, and the anesthesiologist was a med student who stabbed me in the spinal cord ten times before he got it right!
See? Needles in your spine?
Childbirth is a horror movie.
That is not helping.
Jake, there's a copy of our birth plan on my desk.
Call the doula.
Copy that.
I will call the doula.
Which is a thing that I definitely know what it is.
A doula is someone who supports you emotionally and physically and coaches you through the process.
Oh, I see.
So sort of like a vaginal Gandalf?
Stop saying that word!
Ooh, that's actually a pretty good analogy.
Well, Sharon liked it, Sarge.
All right, listen, you have nothing to worry about.
I've got it totally under control here.
Love you, bye. Great.
So I'm gonna go get your birth plan and then summon your wizard.
Oh, Sharon, I heard you had gone into labor in our police station.
I hope you don't contract an infection.
Yeah, we all hope that.
Hey, Cap-i-tan, Could I speak with you outside for just one moment?
Don't leave me.
Listen, you've got your plate full today, and this whole Sharon having a baby thing is honestly beneath you.
But I know a lot about childbirth.
My ex-boyfriend, Frederick was an OB/GYN and we would often talk about his work.
Before he started talking about it with...
Dave.
Well, you should probably know that I also have a lot of experience with childbirth.
And, with a final grunt, the mighty rhino expels her calf.
Ugh!
Gross! Come out of an egg next time.
I'm gonna go check in on Sharon.
Make sure she's not pushing prematurely... fatiguing the uterus.
Okay, wait, you can't talk to her!
Terry doesn't want you in there.
You make her uncomfortable.
I make her uncomfortable?
[sighs]
Well, that's ridiculous.
I should go confront her about this at length.
No, wait!
You could, but I think that would probably stress her out and we're trying to keep her calm right now.
So maybe just...
Focus on work?
Of course.
I only want to help.
Whatever's best for Sharon.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
You're fine with that?
Absolutely. I don't take it personally.
I mean, it's about me and my behavior, specifically, nobody else... not Hitchcock or Scully, but yeah, I'm fine.
What a joyous occasion.
So...
Sharon's water just broke.
Are you kidding? Let's go!
Hold up.
This guy knows where our murderer is hiding.
Just give me two minutes alone with him.
I'll let him know what's gonna happen to him if he doesn't cooperate.
[crying] I'm gonna miss the birth of my child!
It's a magical moment!
[crying] Okay, okay!
I'll tell you everything.
Thank you for letting me be part of this wonderful experience.
You're a terrible person, but you're welcome.
There you go.
All right.
Safe and sound.
So I spoke with your doily...
Doula.
So close.
And, unfortunately, she is out of town for Thanksgiving.
What?
I also spoke with your backup doula, who is in town.
Oh, thank God.
But is assisting with another birth.
Ugh!
Should not have paused between those two sentences.
Yeah.
Jake, where's Terry?
I don't know, exactly, but everything is okay.
I have familiarized myself with the soothing section of your birth plan, and I will now speak in a low, calming, Barry White voice.
[imitating Barry White] Oh, yeah.
Just breathe, baby.
You're making me more tense.
Yeah, I get why.
I'm doing a bad, bad job, girl.
How about we put on some relaxing music?
I think that Terry's got some CDs on his desk.
Oh, great. Hey, Gina, can you grab those?
I have made the mistake of looking at the birthing plan and just learned what an episiotomy is.
I'm gonna need 90 minutes.
Okay. I'll grab the CDs.
Be right back.
Oh, hey, sir, thank you again for letting us use your office.
I'm fine.
I'm getting a lot of work done here at Gina's desk.
It's wonderful.
She has all my favorite chewing gums.
Okay, well, I'm just getting some CDs from Terry's desk to help relax Sharon.
I don't know why you're telling me.
I'm not involved.
You made that very clear.
All right.
Do you work here?
I do.
My son was arrested six hours ago, and nobody can tell me when he's getting out.
What is going on?
[crowd arguing]
Uh-huh.
Yup.
Great question.
I will be right with you folks.
[door shutting]
Guys, we have clear some of these people.
I'm trying to keep things calm for Sharon, and this is not helping.
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm already writing dangerously fast.
It's Smudge City here, Jake.
Smudge City!
I mean, the problem is, we only have one fax machine, and it takes four minutes per page.
It's Logjam City, Jake. Logjam City!
Well, Sharon is about to have a baby, all right?
So I need it to be Calm City in here.
Calm City!
Hey, if you need more fax machines, there's a ton of them in that storage room where I go to take a nap.
Both: What?
Why didn't you say something?
And once again, Hitchcock and Scully save the day.
You didn't do anything. It was all Scully.
We're a package deal, everyone knows that.
Why is this train stopped?
I'm freaking out!
Sorry for the delay, but it turns out there's an exciting reason: The train in front of us has a pregnant woman on board, and she's giving birth.
[cheers and applause]]
Oh, don't applaud that!
Hey, this is terrible!
I'm sorry, but my wife is giving birth right now too!
[weak applause]
No, that's not what I want!
It feels real forced.
Move this train!
All right, so I was unable to get the CDs, however, I can sing you a very soothing tune.
Something like...
♪ When I get that feeling ♪
♪ I need sexual healing ♪
[alarm blaring] Oh boy.
What is that?
Is there a fire?
All right, I'm gonna go check this out.
Sharon, you stay here and prepare to jump out the window.
That came out weird.
[fire extinguisher hissing]
Guys, what the hell is going on?
Hitchcock and Scully saved the day.
No, you plugged ten fax machines into one outlet and caused a fire.
But I pointed to the fire extinguisher and was like, ""The fire extinguisher's over there.""
You pointed at the toaster oven!
You guys, the alarm is freaking out Sharon.
Does anyone know how to turn it off?
There's an override switch switch in my office above the thermostat.
Great. Can you turn it off?
Yes, I'd love to help out.
Perhaps you'd like me to wear a bomb suit with an opaque visor so Sharon doesn't know that it is I who...
Just forget it. I'll do it!
Oh, good. You didn't jump.
What's going on? Is everything okay?
Yes, I just need to flick this switch and turn off the old alarm-a-roono.
Oh, must've been the wrong switch.
But this one...
[water spraying]
Turns on the sprinklers.
[alarm and sprinklers continue]
And apparently, does not turn them back off. [chuckles]



[crowd murmuring]
Guys. What's going on?
I thought you were gonna clear the room?
They won't listen to us.
They're hungry and pissed and they all hate cops.
Would you guys just fix the paperwork problem?
I'll take care of this.
Excuse me, everyone.
Everyone, I'm gonna need you all to clear the room.
This woman is having vaginal contractions.
It's just ""contractions,"" you don't have to add ""vaginal"" to it.
Oh, sorry. This woman is having non-vaginal contractions.
Everyone out, please.
[crowd grumbling]
That was better, right?
Get you down...
Thank you. Thank you.
[pained groaning]
All right, Sharon.
Things are about to get very calm in here, all right?
Look at me.
You're gonna be so relaxed, that baby's gonna pop right out onto the floor, you won't even notice.
Don't let my baby touch the floor!
Right, right! Because of the filth.
Where is Terry?
I don't know.
His phone's going straight to voice-mail.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.
[screaming] No hospital!
Yeah, no hospital, baby.
I will be right back.
Sir?
I need your help.
I knew this moment would come, and I will be the bigger man.
I'd be happy to help.
Great.
We need a doctor here immediately.
We have to get your ex-boyfriend.
I will not help you.
Things did not end well between Frederick and me.
Ooh, why not?
Dish, sir, dish.
Gina, no.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but we simply don't have time to hear about the captain's sordid romantic past.
What have you become?
A hero in a time of crisis.
You stay here and take care of Sharon.
Ugh.
What if she's still pregnant when I get in there?
Then you'll deal with it.
Sir, we're going to get Frederick right now.
I'm sure he's over whatever little fight you guys had.
[upbeat music]
Frederick? Happy Thanksgiving.
[door slamming]
Huh.
Six more miles. Run, Terry, run!
Think of your wife in the care of Jake!
Sarge, look!
Aw, hell yeah!
[engine revving]
[motorcycle rumbling]
[intense music]
[wheels screeching]
[yelling]
Terry is terrified!
[groaning]
It's no use, they're all ruined.
No email, now no fax.
What're we gonna do?
I'll tell you what my dad used to tell me: ""When the going gets tough, ""the pill bug curls into a ball and pretends to be dead.""
You think we should pretend to be dead?
You asked for a solution, I gave you one.
[groans]
Hitchcock, Scully, how did you get things done before the internet and faxing?
Cocaine?
Right.
And also the tubes.
There's 27 miles of pneumatic tubes under the city, connecting all the precincts.
Guys.
You really think these still work?
Oh, I think they still...
[yelling]
[air whooshing, yelling]
Okay, I found you a pillow.
Full disclosure, it's Scully's hemorrhoid donut I don't want that near my baby.
Yeah, that's the right call.
Okay, I'm gonna go Howard Hughes my hands.
I am so uncomfortable.
Can we please try one of my positions from my birth plan?
Okay.
Think positive thoughts.
You're in a Channing Tatum movie.
You're in a Channing Tatum movie.
I don't like Channing Tatum.
I'm not talking to you.
[knocking]
Please don't slam the door again.
We have a bit of a medical situation.
Well, I wish I could help, but unfortunately, I have a bit of a wooden duck situation.
Excuse me, what now?
Still on about the duck, Frederick?
Years ago, when we moved in together, an antique duck decoy of his was misplaced.
It wasn't misplaced.
You threw it in the trash.
And with it, our relationship.
Oh, please.
We had other problems.
Or have you forgotten about...
Dave?
Dave and I were coworkers and nothing more.
Nothing more. Right?
Problem solved, everybody's friends.
Let's go help Sharon.
I will be happy to assist you if you will just admit, Raymond, that you threw my decoy in the garbage.
That will never happen because it's not true.
Thank you for nothing.
Good day.
Hi.
Would you mind just standing there with your glorious beard for one moment?
I'll be right back.
What the hell?
Just tell him what he wants to hear.
But it's a lie.
I don't give a crap, sir.
Sharon needs a doctor, so get over yourself.
Tell him you threw away his stupid duck, then give him 20 bucks to buy a new one.
It cost $740.
What?
That is an insane price for a duck!
That's way too much!
All right, now I'm angry about the wrong thing.
Look, just fix this for Sharon.
Frederick, the duck was ugly and gross and I threw it in the garbage.
Wow.
Well, I know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving: The truth.
[motorcycle rumbling]
[intense music]
[cell phone ringing]
My phone's ringing!
Oh... Oh no! No!
[motorcycle rumbles]
[sighs]
Terry's still not answering his phone.
Why am I the only one who cares about this baby?
[laughing]
Hey, what took so long? Is she okay?
Yeah, I was just telling her the entire duck story, now that it finally has a satisfying ending.
No, everything's fine, but I am a little concerned about Sharon's blood pressure.
And this is a terrible environment.
I wouldn't call it terrible.
We're surrounded by criminals, there's no bed, and you can hear the faint sound of someone screaming through all the vents.
That's Hitchcock.
His arm's stuck in a pneumatic tube.
It's hilarious.
[chuckling]
In my professional opinion, Sharon should go to the hospital.
[door opening]
[heavy breathing]
Hey.
So the doctor thinks we should go to the hospital.
Both: No hospital!
Yup, I thought you might say that.
Look, I can't get a hold of Terry.
Ugh, that one was rough.
Oh, maybe I should listen to the doctor.
What do you think?
Sharon, it doesn't matter what I think.
You and the sarge have a plan.
Yeah, but the plan changed, like, five horrible things ago.
I'm in a lot of pain.
I mean, I know we said no hospital, but...
I don't want to risk anything by making a stupid mistake.
Look, you're my god-husband.
We both know that's a fake position.
Not anymore.
What would you do?
[sighs]
[door opening]
Where is she?
Where's Sharon?
Room 41B.
Look, I'm sorry. I know you said...
Don't go to the hospital!
I tried calling you, you didn't pick up.
So you decided to do the exact opposite of the one thing I told you?
I thought it was the right thing to do, Terry.
Look, she's in there with Captain Holt's ex-boyfriend right now, but don't worry, I made him promise to stop bringing up the duck.
What the hell are you talking about?
I...
You know what?
I'll deal with you later.
Seems like you already dealt with me.
I got the gist, we're good.
Peralta, can I confess something to you?
I didn't throw Frederick's duck in the garbage.
Yes, I know, sir.
I didn't throw the duck in the garbage.
I threw it off a bridge.
[funky music]
Why would you do that?
Well, Frederick and I were having problems.
He knew I disliked the duck because of its weak beak, but he insisted on displaying it anyway.
I acted out in a petty manner.
Just as I did today.
I'm sorry that I wasn't more helpful.
It's fine, I understand.
You might find this hard to believe, but I can be a little childish sometimes, myself.
Yes.
You have gum in your hair right now.
Noted.
Hey!
Hey! You guys came.
What about all the paperwork?
We got it all in.
Filed 900 forms by hand in under 12 hours.
It was tough, but worth it.
We wouldn't have missed this.
Also, we had to go to the ER anyway.
Hitchcock's arm was mangled by the tube.
I'm in unspeakable pain.
Oh.
Ugh, this is agonizing.
It's been over an hour.
This has to be a record for longest childbirth.
It's a girl!
[cheers and applause]
Her name is Ava Jeffords.
She's 14 pounds, six ounces.
Whoa.
Oh yeah, Terry Jeffords makes big babies.
Guys, I just want to say thanks to all of you.
Charles and Amy filling out forms.
Rosa, I'm so thankful you got me here on that bike.
I'm thankful I could help.
I'm thankful that I'm...
Boyle, this is clearly a moment between him and Diaz.
Captain Holt, you brought me the doctor that brought my girl into the world.
And Gina, I know you got past your fears and helped Sharon out.
I'm so happy for you and I never want to see your daughter or remember this day.
And Hitchcock and Scully, I assume you're here for some unrelated injury.
That's correct.
Jake.
Can I see you for a minute?
Oh. Yeah.
It's a girl.
Ouch! Worth it.
Sharon and I wanted you to be the first person to meet Ava.
Oh, wow.
She's beautiful.
I'm sorry I got angry earlier.
You did a great job today.
Hospital was the right decision.
I'm so glad you're Ava's godfather.
I'm so glad you're Sharon's god-husband.
I'm so glad you're my god-wife.
I have no idea what I'm saying at this point.
Thank you, Jake.
You want to hold her?
Oh, um...
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
The baby, Jake!
Yeah! Right, right, the normal thing.

Do you guys know anyone who wants some used textbooks?
I'd love them.
It's never too late to teach yourself something new...
So no one.
Great.
Why are you throwing those out?
Because I'm never gonna pass this astronomy final, so I won't graduate, so my life is ruined.
Or we could help you study.
I did graduate magna cum laude from Syracuse.
I know that sounds like a brag.
And it was!
Terry killed it in college.
Plus, I know a thing or two about astronomy.
I had 11 straight birthdays at the planetarium.
That was also a brag.
My God, you guys are such pathetic nerds.
But maybe that's what I need right now, pathetic nerds.
Okay.
You pathetic nerds can help me.
Thank you?
You are so welcome.
Peralta, Diaz.
This is Inspector Knausgaard and Deputy Inspector Carlsson.
Their flight here was eight hours.
It's been a pleasure talking with you about the duration of your flight.
Good day.
Well, there goes my opening question about how long your flight was.
It was eight hours.
Yeah, no, I got that.
I was joking, sorry.
It must have got lost in translation.
No, we understand you perfectly.
Everyone in Sweden speaks English.
We also speak Norwegian, Dutch, German, French, Russian, and Finnish.
But not Danish.
That is a garbage language for garbage people.
Yeah.
Oh, word up.
Well, I have almost memorized ""Gangnam Style"" phonetically, so samesies.
I don't know this word. ""Samesies""?
From context, I believe it means ""proudly uneducated.""
Ah.
So...
No.
Where's our prisoner?
Being processed.
But, in the meantime, may I offer you some of the finest cuisine in Brooklyn from my favorite restaurant?
The food cart outside the precinct.
It's really good.
Hm, none for Soren.
He's allergic to lactose, gluten, and tomato ketchup.
Oh.
Also, none for Agneta.
She and her husband are trying to have another baby, so she can't eat anything that will alter her cervical pH.
Oh.
You guys are real close, huh?
In Sweden, we believe for a proper team to function, partners must be completely open with each other.
Yeah. We have no secrets.
Not even our bodies.
We sauna together all the time.
Yeah, well, we are also very close.
One time, Rosa saw me in my bathing suit.
No, I didn't, you told me to turn around.
Yeah.
Well, uh, since we cannot eat your disgusting street food, could you please check if our prisoner has been processed?
Yeah, we don't mean to offend, it's just this place is filthy and you both seem unprofessional.
Unprofessional?
Well, we were going to take you to our favorite laser tag place, but now, you're officially uninvited.
Rosa.
Ah, Boyle. Just the man we were looking for.
Kevin has accepted a fellowship to teach at the Sorbonne for the next six months.
Oh, I love Paris.
At least how it's represented in the movie ""Ratatouille.""
Uh...
The rodent chef.
Ah, yes. Farfetched.
Anyway, Kevin and I belong to the Park Slope Racquet Club, where we've established a squash doubles dynasty.
We've taken home the trophy two years in a row.
Unfortunately, I'll be flying to Paris this year during the tournament.
It's a seven-hour flight.
[whistles]
I remember you told me you played in college.
Three-time intramural champion at Sarah Lawrence.
Would have been four, but senior year I played Greaseball in our school's production of ""Starlight Express.""
Interesting casting.
In any case, I would be honored if you would take my place so that Raymond could make it a treble.
Absolutely! I would love to do that!
Great.
Formidable.
Yup!
That is great. This is great.
This is terrible.
Why?
You always said you wanted more face time with Holt.
No, not like this.
Squash brings out my competitive side.
Breaking racquets, cursing, excessive mooning.
One time, just to psych a guy out, I locked eyes with him and ate a squash ball.
That's not possible.
It's still in me, Terry.
Look, the point is to have fun.
So just relax and have fun.
Right, right, right, yeah.
It's just a game.
It's fun.
There's no need for Holt to see me unleash the beast.
[laughs] Okay.
That's a strange little man.
Probably telling Captain Holt how much they like to sauna together.
Please.
They think they're so great just 'cause they know each other's allergies.
You know what I'm allergic to?
Yup. Them.
Totally.
And also bees. You should know that.
If I got stung by a bee, I could die.
Detectives, I've been talking with the inspectors.
There's been a development in the Kottbullediamant case.
Excellent pronunciation, Captain.
Tack. They believe our perp may have smuggled more stolen Swedish diamonds into Brooklyn.
Oh, well, thank you for the tip.
Have a wonderful flight home.
We will send you the jewels as soon as we find them.
They're staying and working the case with you.
Ah, fantastic.
Rosa, could you please fill my car with a million bees?
Okay, since the Swedes are rudely late, let's talk anniversary gift.
Should I get Amy something caszh like shot glasses, or something less caszh, like golden shot glasses?
Still don't care. How about I get a jump on our new partners and search the perp's apartment?
Right. We'll get some clues, solve the case, make them look like fools.
They can eat our American dust.
No, no.
Soren is probably allergic to dust.
Oh, hello!
Yes, I am allergic to dust.
Everyone is.
That's what sneezes are.
You're what sneezes are.
Okay. [clears throat]
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, in Sweden, we call it police work.
Perhaps you don't have a word for it?
[whispers] I hate you.
This is our case.
You can't work it without us.
Get your weird, hairless fingers off of it.
Soren shaves his fingers for cycling.
It cuts down on drag.
Agneta is my biggest fanatic.
Just as I am a fanatic of her slam poetry.
Would you like to hear some?
Would I like to?
I would hate to!
Your loss.
Well, we've already searched the entire apartment.
Yeah, well, now we're gonna search it, and find things you all missed, like this!
Your own keys?
Damn straight.
Bag 'em, Diaz.

Astronomy is full of interesting facts.
For instance, here's one that Hollywood doesn't want you to know.
A parsec is actually a measure of distance.
One of the many inaccuracies in the ""Star Wars"" universe.
Uh-huh. And what's ""Star Wars""?
Oh, boy.
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
Okay, let's talk planets.
Jupiter is a gas giant.
So is Hitchcock.
How does this help me?
It also has 67 moons.
I came up with a fun mnemonic device to remember them all.
It goes, ""Every Individual Gets Crayons ""After Telling His Aggressive Little Mongoose Painter Called Ernest Some Lies About Tiny Panda Heads... period... Maybe One Kid Could Take Her Elephant Into California, Except...""
Where's Gina?
She told me you called me a gas giant.
Well, now you and I will never hook up.
Uh-oh. What's this?
A little piece of evidence that evaded your bald little hands.
A shipping manifest that was shoved into the back of a drawer.
Our perp transferred a container to a shipyard in Bay Ridge on October 11th.
That arrived over a month ago, I doubt you'll find anything in it.
Please, you're just pissed we cracked the case wide open and you've got nada.
That's right, I speak Spanish.
Actually, we've got much more than nada.
Damn it, he speaks Spanish too.
Agneta found an invitation to a party tonight at the home of...
Alvar Gustavsson.
The hot blond guy from ""True Blood""?
No, the Swedish millionaire with ties to organized crime.
Alvar Gustavsson.
Yeah.
Oh, that... Alvar Gooz-hev-vren.
Well, you're welcome to pursue that dead-end lead while we got to the shipping container and find the jewels.
And maybe to celebrate, Rosa will wear them to your dumbass party.
No, they're priceless, please do not do that.
Yeah, obviously we wouldn't.
We were just being jerks.
See you later, jerks.
Okay.
Bye, Jake. Bye, Rosie.
Whoo! You ready, Boyle?
Psyched up?
No, why?
Do I seem psyched?
'Cause I'm definitely not.
I just want to have fun.
And to win.
Hey, if we all have fun and don't throw any racquets and don't eat squash balls, then we're all winners.

Nothing. I'll serve.

I know astronomy can seem a little daunting and scientific, but I have a friend who I think can make it pretty interesting.
Who dis?
Hi, Gina, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.
And I care, why?
Director of the Hayden Planetarium.
One of the world's leading astrophysicists.
And he's doing me a huge favor.
And how do you know Terrance, Space Tie?
We're gym buddies.
[grunting]



Damn, Neil deGrasse Tyson!
How are you doing that?
It's physics, Terry.
It's physics.
Gina, look.
Give me two hours.
You'll not only pass your exam, you'll gain a deeper appreciation of the universe through which we journey on this spaceship Earth.
Spaceship Earth? Way to go.
You just made Earth lame, and that is my house.
Gina, why did you want to take astronomy?
Because I thought it would be cool, just me, sitting around naming moons left and right, like ""Zorp,"" ""Bong,"" ""Dingo.""
""Etcetera,"" that would be one of the names.
""Etcetera.""
She's gonna fail, isn't she?
Big time.
Yeah.
According to the shipping company, the container that came in on October 11th is 34G1.
Cool.
Hey, what did you and Marcus do for your six-month anniversary?
Keeping in mind, that he's dreamy and romantic and I only own $50.
Marcus and I broke up.
What? When?
A month ago.
A month ago?
How do I not know about this?
Because we don't talk about that crap.
We're not lame like the Swedes.
Right.
Yeah, totally.
If Agneta broke up with her husband, she'd probably be all, ""Oh, Soren, I am so heartbroken,"" and he'd be like, ""What can I do to help? I'm sorry,"" and give her a big old hug and she'd be all feeling better like an idiot.
We don't need to do that because what we do together is solve crimes.
You know it.
For example...
34G1.
Boom.
We are about to uncover a butt-load of diamonds.
Exactly.
It's fish! It's fish, Rosa!
Ugh.

Oh, hello, Jake.
You missed quite a party.
The blond man from ""True Blood"" was there.
Very cool guy.
So cool.
Yeah, that's cool. Hey, this is weird because I hate you guys, but can I ask you a question?
If you broke up with your husband, would you tell Soren about it?
Are you making a funny laugh joke right now?
I would insist he be there for it so that my husband would have a shoulder to cry on.
Yeah, several years ago, Agneta and Lars were having trouble conceiving.
She didn't even have to ask me to donate my sperm.
I had it already in a ""Tooperware,"" ready to go.
Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.
Can we ask you a question?
Mm-hm.
Why do you smell like fish?
Is it hygiene?
No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.
Did they?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.
They didn't.
Although, one did have a battery in it.
What kind of a sicko feeds a battery to a fish?
Well, while you were wasting your time, we set up a meeting on 14 November with the man we think is the buyer.
Um...
No, don't worry, Soren.
I rescheduled your cycling practice for 16 November, and your dentist for 19 November.
You know me so well.
[giggles]
Ugh. Those guys suck.
They're so into each other, they're probably gonna start holding hands.
Oh, they're actually holding hands.
Yeah, they are awful, for sure.
All tall and beautiful, and you don't want to know what they've got in their ""Tooperware.""
But honestly, I don't know that it's that bad that they're close.
Wrong, it's the worst.
Okay.
Oh, my God, I just figured out where the diamonds are.
We thought the shipping container came in on October 11th, 10/11, but dumb Europeans write their dates backwards.
We should've been going through the one from 10 November.
Of course!
Stupid rest of the world, writing their date all dumb.
Yeah. Let's go.
Okay.
Boyle.
Is everything okay, you know, with your brain?
Yeah. I'm great.
I'm having a lot of fun.
Yes, I've heard you say that 162 times.
You do realize, that if we lose this next match, we're out of the tournament?
Yes, but the important thing is we had a good time.
No! The important thing is that we win the trophy.
Because I promised Kevin before he left for Paris that we would do that.
Do you know why I chose you as my partner?
Because I'm the most athletic person you know?
No, because of an article I read in the ""Sarah Lawrence Phoenix"" about a young man they called ""squash's unhinged lunatic.""
I don't know what you're talking about.
According to that article, that lunatic was 27-0.
I need him on my team.

I am not enjoying this, no matter how much it is 100% my favorite movie come to life.
The important thing is keep Gina safe.
You have a civilian with you. I'm on the way.
Cool. Oh! Also bring a pic of yourself in a towel coming out of the shower.
Can't explain why, okay? Gotta go, bye.
There's a serious situation going down they need my help with.
Did one of your detectives lose his head up his own butt?
You don't even have a job, Zeke!
You know what, I'm not supposed to be bringing this up, but I'm bringing it up!
I'm sick of hearing you got things brewing.
You ask me, the only thing you got brewing is a pot of BS!
Kids, I love you. Sharon, you are perfect.
Zeke, get a job!

I'm gonna help you take these guys down.

No, you're not doing anything like that.
You're not a cop.
I've watched what you do for six years.
It's not that difficult.
""NYPD! You're under arrest!""

That was clearly an impression of Charles.
But stay here with him while I do some recon.
Wait, shouldn't we all stick together?
Someone has to asses the situation, Boyle.
Plus, we're trapped, on Christmas, with a bunch of bad guys who are very likely German.
This is my John McClane moment.
Okay. You're gonna need a tank top.
You can have mine.
No need.
I snagged this on the way here.

Yeah, they didn't have the best selection.
I'll probably just skip the tank.
Yeah.
I will return.
Okay. Gina.

I'm scared you won't let me make a flamethrower and use it to throw flame.
You're right. I will not do that.
You're gonna stay here and keep hiding.
Boyle and I are gonna handle this.
Here's the situation. 12 terrorists, 1 cop.
Just the way he likes it.
Who's he?
Me!
Why are you calling yourself ""He""?
Because that's the tagline from the ""Die Hard"" poster, and also my high school yearbook quote.
Oh, I knew I recognized it. Next time, lead with that.
Right. Sorry. Also, there aren't 12 of them.
There are seven, and they're not terrorists, they're robbers.
They brought drilling equipment to break into the safe.
Okay, so it's really seven robbers, two cops, and one Gina.
Yes. Exactly.
Yeah.
Where's Gina?
Gina?
There she is. She went for the hairspray.
She is incorrigible.
Who are you? Come here.
No!
No, no, no, no. Jake, they're taking Gina.
Yeah, I know. We're looking at the same thing.

I told you to watch her!
I know.
I am so sorry, but I promise you, we will get her back.
Oh, this is bad.
I got to report this to the Vulture.
He's in charge.
Ugh! The Vulture?
I thought he was on his massage tour of Southeast Asia.
He's leaving tomorrow.
That's why he wants this over quickly.
He wants to storm the building.
No!
No, no, no. That is a bad idea.
Look, we still haven't figured out where they're holding Gina and the rest of the hostages.
If you guys come busting in here, things could go sideways real fast.
That's what I told him, but then he just repeated it back to me in a lady's voice.
Listen to me, Sarge.
Boyle and I can take these guys out one by one and no one will get hurt.
Just ask the Vulture to give me some more time.
He'll be reasonable.
What am I talking about? It's the Vulture.
Tell him Tila Tequila's doing a free show in Central Park.
Then how come Tila just posted a selfie from the Kid Rock show in Daytona, bro?
Yeah, I follow her. You know what?
I know what's going on here.
Jake wants to go solo, and he's trying to steal my thunder.
He's inside and he has eyes on the situation.
Look, I'm in command here. Look around you.
I control all of this.
You see that guy behind you? That sniper?
He'll shoot whoever I tell him to.
Even you.
No, I won't.
Fine.
Then, uh, he'll sit on any rooftop I tell him to.
Hey, go sit on that rooftop, guy.
Look, just give Jake a chance.
If he fails, then you can storm the building.
I'll give him a chance to sit on his little white butt and wait for me to come rescue him.
You tell him that I'm Liam Neeson and he's my hot, dumb daughter.
All right, we're outnumbered and unarmed.
If we're gonna get Gina back, we need weapons.
This place sells hammers, wrenches...
Do they sell plants?
Because some of that potting soil is very toxic if ingested in large quantities.
So you want to feed the bad guys a lot of soil?
Force-feed 'em.
Okay, that's a good option that I will definitely consider.
Now, let's go out there and gear our asses up.
Both: Quietly.

Hostage taker: Eleanor Horstweil.
Age: 42. Occupation: Bank manager.
No priors. Clean bill of health.
Current husband: Hercules Thikalonos.
Don't bring him into it. We're actually quite close.
Noted. You divorced in 2010.
She got the house, both cars, and 85% of your salary going forward.
That's a typo, right?
It is not.
How did she get so much?
My lawyer was Hercules. That's how they met.
That seems real unethical.
Again, lay off Hercules. He's quite a decent man.
All right, look, we need some sort of bargaining chip.
Is there anything you got in the divorce that she wanted?
Yes... Abigail.
I'm gonna just assume Abigail's something super weird.
Nope. She was our hairdresser.
Ah, okay.
It was awkward for her to see both of us, so she made us choose.
I mean, I couldn't get rid of her.

I mean, you saw her hair today.

Hey, Sergeant.
How are you?
Well, my baby cries at the sight of my face now, so that's great.
I mean, she's a baby; She could be crying at anything.
Nope, she pointed right at my nose and then threw up.
What do you want, Santiago?
I was just wondering if you finished writing that recommendation letter.
It's due pretty soon.
I'm working on it.
It's taking a little while because it's hard to concentrate, what with all the agony.
Okay, well, thank you for still doing it.
If it helps, I brought you some soothing ginger tea.

Oh, God, I'm sorry! I'll get some cold water!
No, no, don't.
I am petrified of you!
All right, remember, this is a negotiation.
We can't let her know how badly you want this.
Jake, what if she destroys the sperm?
She's not gonna do that, Charles, because then she'd have no leverage.
All right, you know this; They never shoot the hostage.
Hey!
Did you threaten that 90-year-old man for me yet?
What? The guy you hit was 90?
Yeah, and you would know that if you had talked to him, which obviously you did not, so good-bye!
No, no, wait, wait, look.
We can't help you out until we know that you actually have the samples.
We need proof of life.
I'd be happy to dump one of the containers out of the window.
No, no, no, don't do that, please!
Don't dumb my sperm on us!
Hello, ma'am. Top of the morning to you.
All right, look, if you let us upstairs...
We'll give you Abigail.
I'll buzz you in.
And that is how it's done.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Why would you bring up babies right now?
It's a saying.
Who would do that?
The question is, why would someone want to talk to Gina?
That's very rude.
It's obvious why the guy wants to talk to a civilian like her; He's stalling.
That's also rude.
Maybe he wants to talk to a normal person instead of two rude cops.
Well, whatever his reason, we have no other choice.
Gina take his statement.
Yes, thank you!
I'm gonna get this guy to admit to crimes he hasn't even committed.
No, that would be a huge problem.
Copy that.
We'll get you a file on him so you can study up.
That won't be necessary. I'm gonna go with my gut.

Let's give the people what they want.

I'm ready to give you immunity.
No, you're not. That's not happening!

It's my sperm.
It's in the freezer.
I'll be right back.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Abigail was our only bargaining chip.
Don't worry. I have a plan.
As soon as she comes back in here, I'm gonna grab that cup right out of her hands and run like hell.
You think that'll work?
I don't just think it will.
I know it might.
Here it is... cold and sad. Just like you.
How do I know that that's really Charles'?
I'm gonna have to read the label up close.
If I could just take a look...[laughs]
Go, Boyle!
[shouts]
You really think I'm that stupid?
It's called a dummy cup, dummies.
Damn it. She's right; It's empty.
Oh...
I'm actually kind of relieved.
I did not want to see that.
You two are messing with the wrong woman.
And now you're gonna pay for it.
Wait, wait!
Eleanor, Eleanor!
There are two real containers.
One is in a safe location, and this is the other one.
Or rather, it was the other one.
[clattering]
No!
[garbage disposal churning]
She shot a hostage.
Charles, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice, Jake.
I'm gonna go bully an old priest so I can get my sperms back.
He's a priest?
Yeah, I looked him up.
He's a priest, a 90-year-old priest.
But don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm just gonna casually yawn...
Thereby exposing my gun and badge.
Listen, you can't do this, Charles; It's illegal.
I have to.
You saw what Eleanor did to millions of my babies.
I heard them scream!
That was you.
I am them, and they are me.
You could go to prison, okay?
You're right. You're right.
What am I thinking?
Thank you for looking out for me...
Yeah.
Friend.
No! What... oh, Charles, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no! Not the keys, no!
Oh, I should've known.
You're a hugger, not a shaker.
It was the most painful thing I've ever done, and I've taken three of my grandparents off life support.
How are you always in charge of that?
Wait, Charles, do not get in that car!
He's getting in the car.
Sorry.
Don't you drive away!
He's driving away.
[tires screeching] Charles!
[computer beeps]
[gasps] I just got an email from SAM-SAM.
Rejected?
I've never been rejected from anything.
Me neither.
Oops, did you say rejected or ejected?
I've been rejected a lot.
I don't understand.
My application was so good.
You know what? I've also been ejected.
Flume ride, Topeka, Kansas.
How did this happen?
Just forgot to put on the belt.
Jeffords.
Good talk, Ames.
You wrote me a bad recommendation.
How could you?
Excuse me?
It's the only explanation!
You're mad that I broke your face and I burned your whole body.
Well, grow up!
Grow up?
I have a Roth IRA!
I eat wheat toast! You grow up!
You know what?
Here's the letter that I sent.
""Amy Santiago is one of the finest detectives in my precinct... nay, the entire NYPD.""
Yeah, I even used the word ""nay.""
The idea that you would question my integrity is so...
Uh-oh, I got to sneeze. This is gonna hurt!
Oh, oh, God.
[sneezing]
[screaming]
Oh, Hitchcock, thank God!
Handcuffed yourself to a car?
Been there.
What? No, Charles did this.
Here, quick, hand me those keys.
Here we go.
What will you give me for them?
Seriously? What do you want?
A dollar for a soda; Mine are all wet.
Yes, obviously, I'll give you that!
Bam!
A soda only costs 75¢, you fool.
See you later, sucker!
Didn't even give him the dollar.
I know it seems like I blew it, but you got to give me another crack at him.
Now that I'm aware of our fascinating past, I have all the ammo that I need.
Perhaps you would've had that ammo if you had read the file Diaz offered you.
No doubt. No doubt. Gina culpa.
Okay, you get one more chance.
I will not let you down.
Steven, Steven, Steven, I have one question.
Who on the basketball team was into me?
I want names.
What?
We don't have time to play games, Steven.
That's it. I'm pulling her.
No, no, let her keep going.
Question two...
Who on the lacrosse team is into me, and which one them aged the best?
♪ A whole lot of woman... ♪
[rock music playing]
♪ A whole lot of... ♪
In 4,000 feet, stay straight.
You interrupted the song for that?

Hello.
Father, I understand you were recently involved in an automobile accident with an Eleanor Horstweil.
Oh, yes, uh, she came up onto the sidewalk and fractured my hip.
You were a pedestrian?
Are you technically a pedestrian if you're sitting on a bench?
Sitting on a bench...
Well, okay, I don't want to tell you to drop your suit against her, but I sure am getting sleepy.
Excuse me?
Yawns a-coming. [yawns]
[electric buzzing] [screaming]
I got you.
Hi there. I'm Jake.
This is my best friend, Charles.
He's trying to have a baby. You get it.
Now, come here, you.
Charles, I know you're mad, but you have to talk to me.
It's funny how getting tased in the back can break your heart and also really hurt your back.
I'm sorry.
I really wanted to be a papa, and you ruined it.
You pop-blocked me.
I know, but I couldn't let you break the law.
And I won't let Eleanor turn you into a bad person.
What other choice do I have?
There's always a choice, Charles And by the way, DNA is not the only thing that makes somebody into a father.
I mean, not that it's any of my business, but I have biological father, and he's a nightmare.
He never played catch with me.
He never taught me how to ride a bike.
I had to learn how to shave from watching ""Home Alone.""
Makes sense; It's like ""Die Hard"" for kids.
Plus, is this how you really want it to go?
Eleanor controlling your life, ruining your career?
So what do I do?
Honestly, I don't know.
But I do know that you're gonna be a great dad with or without your...
Boyle oil.
Nope, not gonna say it.
But you will.
There's still time left on Eleanor's deadline.
I'm gonna unlock this door.
You do what you got to do.
[door buzzes and clicks]
That seems like a bad sign.
Hey, Santiago, you know why you didn't get into SAM-SAM?
Probably because I used a modern format on my cover letter that put my email above my home address.
Why take such a risk?
No, I sent the recommendation letter to the wrong place.
I thought you were applying to be a mentor, not a mentee.
You thought I wanted to be a SAM, not a SAM?
Are you insane?
Well, you should be a SAM.
No, I should be a SAM.
We got to start saying something other than SAM because we are barreling toward a misunderstanding.
Amy, you are ready to be teaching others.
I made a call; You're going to be a mentor.
Oh, my God...
Sergeant, I'm so sorry for ever questioning your integrity.
Thank you so much...
No, no, no, stand back.
Look, I'm still very scared of you.
Good news. I got Steven to talk.
Diaz, fantastic. How did you do it?
Did you finally show him the municipal court website and the pulldown menus you can't click on?
No, I found something we bonded over.
She didn't even know who I was.
And we were good friends.
On more than one occasion, she's called me Gina.
That's her own name.
No, she didn't.
We complained about Gina for an hour, and then he opened up... gave me the name of the guy he works for.
I have never been so insulted in my entire life.
I'm not gonna work cases for you guys anymore.
We were never going to ask you to.
[chuckles]
You just lost your best detective.
Charles, thank God. What happened?
I did it.
Did what?
I'm freaking out over here; You stormed off.
Yeah, because I was inspired by you.
I ran all the way to Eleanor's house to tell her off.
What do you want, Chunk?
To let you know you can keep my sperm.
I don't need it.
I'm in love and I'm going to be a dad, and there's nothing you could do to stop me.
So good-bye forever.
Oh, and one more thing... tell Hercules I'll see him at spin class on Sunday.
Now good-bye!
How do you guys feel?
Great.
We were looking at possible donors on the way over.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check out this guy.
I like him; He want to Yale.
Oh, wait, that says ""Yeal University.""
Swipe him off.
This is fun... oh, that's weird.
That guy kind of looks like my dad.
Wait a minute. That is my dad.
You cannot use his sperm.
You cannot use his sperm.
My son would be your brother!

Morning, everyone.
Morning, sir.
Hey, look.
We're food stain buds.
Who are you wearing? Porridge?
Um, oatmeal.
Hmm.
Oh, my God.
He didn't even wipe it off.
He's totally given up on life.
It's loneliness.
Ever since Kevin left for his sabbatical in Paris, he hasn't been the same.
I tried to get him out of the house.
I invited him to bar trivia, but he turned me down, not that Trivia Newton John needed the help.
We're nationally ranked. It's no big deal.
You're right, it's not.
Well, aren't you all just a bunch of big-hearted dum-dums.
You want to make him feel less lonely?
This is how you do it.
A case file?
Yeah, dude loves work.
I thought all your cases were closed.
You were bragging about it so much last night, I couldn't hear the end of the neighbors' fight.
It ended in s*x. It always does.
It didn't make me horny.
It's a cold case from my first year as a detective.
Is it active again?
No, but Holt doesn't have to know that.
So you're gonna lie to him?
No, I'm going to make him forget about his sadness through the power of... distraction!
He's gone.
♪ ♪
Ah, hola, mi capitan.
Why am I speaking Italian, you might ask?
That was Spanish.
Yeah, there are too many languages.
An old case of mine is starting to heat up, and I'd like your old help to help me solve it, señor?
Still Spanish.
Right.
Joey Garibaldi was a mafia lieutenant.
About eight years ago, I was closing in on him when he disappeared.
But now I'm hearing chatter on the street that he's back in town.
Will you help me?
Hmm, sounds interesting. Count me in.
Yes! Thank you very much, sir.
Uh, good-a bye-a.
Italian.
Ooh, standardized tests?
I have a great trick.
Fill in all the bubbles with Wite-Out, jams the machine, everyone passes.
These are practice for the lieutenant's exam.
They're kicking my butt.
I can't get better than 70%.
C-minus, the perfect grade... you pass, but you're still hot.
Captain Holt gave me his test to help me study.
Look at what the grader wrote on his essay.
""Thank you for writing this.
Reading it made me a better man.""
I'll never be as good a leader as Holt.
You need to stop focusing on tests.
There's more to life than scores and book learning, okay?
Look at me, I've had no official dance training.
Yet here I stand... a miracle of movement.
Hey, you guys seen Boyle?
Yep, he's in a little ball under his desk.
Oh, no.
Did you watch ""Grimm"" again last night?
You know it gives you nightmares.
I'm sad.
Jason died this morning.
I'm sorry. That's terrible.
Is he a friend of yours?
He was my dog.
Oh, okay, so no big deal then.
No, it is to me.
But don't worry, I'll find a way to power through.
Oh, God.
This is how Jason saw the world.
Wait, was this your dog that humped everything?
Yeah, that's how he died.
He was going to town on one of my snow boots, and his little heart just gave out.
He didn't even finish.
Gross.
Anyway, we have to work a stream of B&E's on 4th Street.
It's time for you to move on.
It's what Jackson would've wanted.
Jason!
Whatever, little buddy.
Captain, thank you for meeting me.
Sorry to make you work on a Saturday.
No, nonsense, I was free.
Kevin is still in Paris.
Is he?
Wow, I totally forgot about that.
Any-hoops, this is all the stuff that we got from Garibaldi's apartment after he disappeared.
Tell me what you see.
This man is in every photograph.
Nick DiTullio.
I actually brought him in eight years ago, but he refused to talk.
Of course, you know the saying, ""time shall open up the mouth of every man to the truth of his neighbor.""
All right, it's a real saying. Let's not dwell on it.
The point is, he's definitely gonna tell us where Garibaldi is.
I don't know where Garibaldi is, all right?
It's not like we were close.
I was just his trainer at the gym.
Then why were you always going out to dinner with him?
Was he doing reps of linguine?
Noice.
Look, you don't say no to Garibaldi, all right?
That's why I always let him work his chest and his abs and never his legs.
Yeah, the key is balance.
That's why I never work any of it.
Unless you guys are gonna arrest me, I got to go.
There's an emergency at the gym.
Emergency at the gym just when two cops show up at his door.
That seems suspicious. We should follow him.
Yeah, this case might actually lead somewhere.
Why are you so surprised?
Because every day on this job is a wonder.
Damn right it is.
Medical examiner, jackpot.
The gym is full of bodies.
No, Department of Health.
Oh.
There's been an outbreak of the mumps.
[chuckles] Mumps, that's a funny word.
It's actually a very serious and highly contagious infectious disease.
Yeah, but we're fine.
We were only in contact with that guy for a couple of seconds.
Plus, he didn't even lick any of our eyeballs.
I'm afraid you both have the mumps.
[chuckles] Mumps, still a funny word.
Are we gonna die?
So you both have the mumps.
Sorry to say, it's very contagious.
You may not want to be here, detective.
Oh, it's cool.
I keep up to date on all my vaccinations.
I'm immune to stuff you've never even heard of.
But not immune to braggadocio.
Anyhow, over the next several hours, you will more than likely develop fever, aching, fatigue.
Doesn't sound too bad.
Also, tart foods will cause intense jaw pain, so you may want to avoid sour candies.
What?
You may get painful goiter-like swelling in your neck and often extreme testicular discomfort.
Okay, okay.
Cool, cool.
Both: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
No doubt.
Due the highly contagious nature of the virus, you will both be quarantined to your houses for the next nine days.
Oh, nine days in isolation.
Sir, I'd be happy to keep you company.
We can watch the ten-part Nicholas Nickleby special on PBS.
Hear there's a lot of long, quiet stretches.
I do love long, quiet stretches, but I don't want to be a burden.
Plus, I'm getting used to being on my own.
Or we could be quarantined together, you know, work the case.
Yes, that actually sounds kind of fun.
Kind of?
It's gonna be the best week ever.
I'm sorry, did you not hear me say extreme testicular discomfort?
Yes, we heard you, Dr. Bad News Doctor.
Okay, so I talked to Captain Holt.
He and Jake have the mumps.
I'm in charge until Holt gets better.
Hello, you wanted to see if you can make a great captain.
Now's your chance to shine.
You're the pretty little understudy.
And the aging lead?
Well, she just fell down the stairs.
Now all's you got to do is beat those wings and fly.
So for the next two weeks, Captain Holt will be on medical leave, which means I am the acting captain.
And we are your royal subjects.
Do continue.
I want this precinct to get our normal work done, but also, we're gonna clean out the evidence room, step up community service, and complete these 22 additional tasks.
Every time we check one off the list, you're gonna hear this bell.
It's the sound of victory.
Hmm, you should add ""fix bell"" to that list.
Morning, Captain.
Peralta.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
[groans]
His name is Simon, and I hate him.
Hello, Simon.
This is Balthazar.
He's an evil demon who spits fire in my throat.
Goiters, huh?
Anyway.
I've been looking over these photographs of the restaurant, and I've identified several other known mob types.
[groans]
What is it? Did you see something?
No, I just got very cold very fast.
And now my entire body is somehow on fire.
Oh, these mumps are jerks. Whew.
I also noticed this van is parked out front in several other photographs.
I never noticed that.
The restaurant must have been under surveillance.
I bet it was the feds.
You're right.
I'll reach out to my contact at the bureau, see if I can get us some footage.
Good idea.
Also, I know you're not supposed to, but I kind of want to poke my mump.
Bad idea.
I'm going in.
Here we go. [yelps]
It hurts!
How did I not see that coming?
I feel dizzy.
Hey.
You're off the floor.
Yeah.
Well, it's like my dad used to say.
""Real men don't cry for more than three days.""
So I decided to get my butt back to work.
Good.
You go through all the witness statements yet?
What? Oh, no.
By ""work,"" I meant on Jason's in memoriam video.
Are you serious?
Oh, yeah.
Take a look at what I got so far.
♪ Tell me how am I supposed to live without you ♪
♪ ♪
♪ Now that I've been loving you so long ♪
Hey, we've got a lot to do.
Focus up and stop watching funny dog videos.
Aw.
This might just be the fever talking, but this unedited footage of an Italian restaurant from eight years ago might be the best movie I've ever seen.
Also, how weird are forks?
Forks are very weird. I've always thought so.
Yeah, yeah.
Did we take too much cold medicine?
Not by a long shot.
Balthazar is a thirsty bitch.
Ah, I'll drink to that.
Wait, look.
Garkabargo!
Sorry, can't... can't talk.
Need more medi-jen.
Garibaldi!
He's eating snakes!
No, it's spaghetti.
It's always spaghetti.
I'm just saying, if that's spaghetti, it looks like snakes.
[bell chimes]
That's right, Nine-Nine.
That's the sound of the victory bell.
We just crossed our first task off the list.
Oh, my goodness.
Terry, that is so great.
Which one was it?
Fix bell.
All right.
Little less than I had hoped for, but still a thing.
You gonna hear that sound nonstop.
Unhand her, you beast!
Give it to me!
What the hell is going on in here?
Hitchcock's trying to steal my sandwich.
Well, we both ordered meatball subs, but they only delivered one.
It's mine!
Guys, guys, look, just walk to the sub shop... it's a block away... and get a second sandwich.
Walk?
Are you insane?
Fine, cut the damn sandwich in half.
And then what, genius? We each eat a 6-inch sub?
Two and a half meatballs a piece?
Are we children?
What is this, Russia?
Okay, that's it. No one eats the sub.
Get back to work!
Wait a minute.
Why'd he just go in the kitchen?
Do we have eyes in the kitchen?
There are eyes everywhere, man.
Ow, ow, achy, achy, ow.
Look, he slipped the chef a piece of paper.
I bet it's the address of his hideout.
The chef knows where the hideout is.
His name is Richie Lignardi.
We talk to him, we find Garibaldi.
We have to go right now.
Go where?
Ah! What's on your face?
Oh, right, uh, yes, my disgusting deformity.
Here, let me just...
Hey, what's up, girl?
Better?
It's not worse.
We're on our way right now to talk to a lead that knows where Garibaldi's hideout is.
You're quarantined.
You can't go outside spewing mumps like a couple of mump fountains.
Not like this, we can't!

Is this the piece of paper you're looking for?
You found the address?
No, it's a recipe for baked ziti.
It was taped to your wall the entire time.
You're delirious, and you're sick, and you definitely didn't solve the case.
You need to go back inside.
Well, I can't.
My legs stopped working.
[grunting]
Ah, my testicles.
The mumps have reached my testicles.
All right, just finish taking off your totally ineffective biohazard suits and have a little rest.
Nonsense, Santiago.
We just have to buckle down and work harder.
We simply hit a bump in the road.
More like a mump in the road.
[laughter]
[both groaning and yelling]
Such a good one.
Jake, can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Sure thing, let me just snag this, cover up the ol' swell sack.
All right.
Okay, so here's the deal.
I have a high fever, and I can't control my body, but you can do whatever you want to me.
Oh, but don't touch my mouth, neck, or testicles.
You've badly misread the situation.
Oh, thank God.
Jake, you need to drop this case.
What are you talking about?
The plan is working perfectly.
Holt hasn't been lonely all week.
Yeah, because he's too busy almost dying.
Look at him.
What?
He's just ""Beautiful Mind""-ing it.
Because he's a genius.
He's writing the word ""case"" over and over again.
Oh, now he's spelling it with a K.
Is that not how you spell it?
Again, I have a mouth, neck, and testicle-melting fever.
Jake.
Hmm?
Enough is enough.
You need to drop this stupid backburner cold case before you both die or I will kill you.
Oh, my God, I thought I was following her.
Yep, I should probably lie down.
Here we go.
Case!
What are you doing?
Just sealing Jason's collar in an airtight bag so it retains his scent.
I don't know how many whiffs I have left.
Wow.
Look, I know that dog meant a lot to you, so I got you this.
It's a dog.
His name's Arlo, but you can call him Jason Two or whatever.
Seriously?
I can't just replace Jason with some other dog.
Why not? All dogs are basically the same.
Watch this. Arlo, go hump that toy.
Get away from that.
That's Jason's.
[toy squeaks]
Look, man, I've been patient.
We have a case we need to work on.
It's time for you to get over it, move on.
Move on?
Move on.
Jason was part of my family, Rosa.
I loved him.
His humping was the only thing that got me through my divorce.
Seeing him so happy made me believe that I could be happy one day too.
You wouldn't understand this because you have a motorcycle helmet for a heart, but I need to feel this sadness.
So the only thing that I'm moving on from is you.
So I, like, have a dog now?
Hey, what's going on with those files?
Oh, we're not working on them.
We're on strike.
Hunger strike.
You're eating potato chips.
Chips don't count.
My doctor said they have zero nutritional value.
We want meatball subs.
You had no right to take ours.
Screw this.
I'll log those files and teach the Hazmat class, and I'll do everyone's work, because apparently, I am the only one keeping this precinct together!
[glass shattering]
Um, I think you closed the door too hard.
Hey, I found popsicles.
These should help cool us down.
[groans]
""Thanks, Jake.""
You're welcome, nards.
Peralta, Balthazar has a sister.
Meet Penelope.
Guh-hoo, yeah, mumps on mumps.
Let's not dwell on it. We should get back to work.
Or we could fall asleep for five to seven days and see how we feel.
I will not rest till justice is served.
There's no time to waste.
This case is urgent.
Oh, boy.
All right, listen.
The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.
Um...
I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.
You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.
I did. I did. I did.
But said chatter may have been fudged.
So you lied to me?
Out of pity.
You pity me.
I wouldn't put it that way.
I would.
I am offended. I am angry.
I am very tired.
So I'm gonna take a nap, but when I wake up, oh, you are in for it.
How dare you?
How dare me?
How dare you?
I was just trying to help.
Wow, your help feels an awful lot like pity, so do me a favor and don't ever help me again.
Wow, well, you didn't seem to mind me helping you when I got you your job back at the Nine-Nine.
I didn't ask you to do that.
[gasps]
You said we were out of peas, you pea hog!
You're the pea hog!
You're the pea hog!
No, you!
You take that back!
You!
[both screaming]
Double poke!
[both grunting]
Okay, hope you guys are hungry.
Made baked ziti.
Thought it would be fun to use Garibaldi's ultra authentic recipe.
Oh, great, pity food.
Thank you anyway, but I can cook for myself.
Wow, I would roll my eyes so hard right now if it didn't make my brain burn.
Okay, Captain, this ends now.
I know your pride is hurt, but no one ever took pity on you.
All we wanted to do was help you when you were down because that's what people do when they care about each other.
They tell each other lies and invent urgent mysteries that need to be solved?
Come up with excuses to spend time together like trivia nights or folk art festivals.
Or working old-ass cases with their mumpy boy, Jake.
Back to you, Amy. We're doing great.
You're gonna eat this ziti, and you're gonna appreciate it, and you're gonna grow the hell up.
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry for the way I acted.
I can't wait to eat your food.
Ugh, this is revolting.
Wow, have you learned nothing?
Oh, God!
That is worse than the mumps, Amy.
What the hell?
I used Garibaldi's exact recipe.
I know I'm not a great cook, but I love following instructions.
Seven cups of salt?
Even I know this isn't a recipe.
Which means it might be a code.
Ooh, interesting.
Ten digits, maybe it's a phone number.
Look, 718, Brooklyn area code.
Yes, that's definitely it.
Wait, did you actually use all of this salt and 18 cups of oregano?
Back off, I solved the case.
Nine onions?
Oh, Amy.
How am I the bad guy here?
All right, all right, looks good.
I can barely tell you hulked out in here.
Yeah, but two weeks in charge, and I didn't get any of my goals accomplished.
You got Hitchcock and Scully off their hunger strike.
I just threw a bunch of popcorn on the floor.
It wasn't that hard.
Yeah, they're animals.
Do you want to know why the amazing Captain Holt has never gotten the evidence room cleaned or done anything on your list?
Why?
Because all day long, he's putting out fires.
That's what a captain does.
The only difference between you and Holt is that he lacks the strength to close a door so hard a room blows up.
Thanks, Gina.
Ah, you don't have to thank me.
All I did was be the only person who believes in you.
Don't lean against the door.
Terry caused structural damage.
My God, you're strong.
Briefing room, now.
I really don't feel like having you yell at me anymore.
What is this?
It's a funeral for Jason.
I want to say a few words.
When Jason died seven days ago, I didn't give a rat's ass.
This is your speech?
'Cause I didn't understand why people care so much about their dumb dogs till I got a dumb dog myself.
I've only had Arlo for a day and a half, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself.
Very violent eulogy, I like it.
Charles, I'm sorry.
You don't have to get over it.
Take as long as you want.
Scully, it's time.
♪ Ave Maria ♪
Okay, thank you.
Good news, Garibaldi's phone number's still active, so they were able to locate him.
SWAT just picked him up, so that's that.
Yeah, that's that.
Perfect timing as our quarantine has finally ended and our goiters are gone.
Yes, indeed.
We're free to go outside and lick whoever's eyeballs we'd like.
Inaccurate, no one is ever free to do that.
Yeah, you're right.
Anyhow, I am out.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I was too proud to admit I was lonely.
So thank you.
You're welcome.
Ain't no thang.
No, it is a thang, and an even bigger thang is that you brought me back to the Nine-Nine, and I will always be grateful for that.
So... Here.
This is for you.
Oh, sour candies.
I missed you so much!
Oh! It burns!
Thank you for this candies!

Okey dokey.
The car is picking me and Amy up in two minutes.
You sure you're cool keeping tabs on my cases while I'm on the cruise?
You bet. I hope you have a great time.
Hey, don't make any new best friends.
[laughs]
[laughing]
Oh. Maybe you shouldn't go.
Are you kidding? I am psyched to go on this week-long cruise, just sitting around doing nothing.
Straight up living that slug life, y'all.
Cruise itineraries, hot out of the laminator.
Who's ready for some nonstop totally scheduled fun?
Oh, I actually thought we could just... sit by the pool, eat unlimited shrimp, and see what it does to our bodies.
That's cute.
I don't know if there's gonna be time, though.
The cruise offers 77 activities, and I signed us up for 76 of them.
Speed dating for widows seemed like a bummer.
Okay, so slightly different perspectives going into this cruise.
Call it the slug life talking, but I think it's gonna work itself out.
Good-bye, coworkers, or as they like to say at sea...
[imitating ship horn]
♪ ♪
This is so great.
Yeah.
Seagulls, check.
The ocean, check.
A gang of oldies in short shorts, check, check, check.
We are definitely on a cruise.
Welcome aboard.
Say, ""I love Carousel Cruises International Ltd.""
I love Carousel Cruises International Ltd.
I don't want to say that.
All right.
So... the Sail Away party is in an hour, and until then, I have us scheduled to take in live music at the all-ages piano lounge.
Okay, okay. Or we could just head straight to the room.
I brought a plastic tarp so we can eat shrimp in bed.
But the all-ages piano lounge has bottomless margaritas.
Eh.
They also have a drink with a potato skin in it.
Ohh. To the all-ages piano lounge, merlady.
Mm-hmm.
Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen, but especially ladies.
[whispers] I know that voice.
Get ready. It's time for some smush songs.
[tender keyboard music playing]
[gasps] Doug Judy. The Pontiac Bandit.
He's here.
We got songs about smushing, songs for smushing to, songs for the kids.
This is the all-ages piano lounge.
I can't believe he's here. I've been hunting him for years, and now fate has dropped him right into my lap.
He's gonna be so surprised when he sees me.
Hey, Peralta, you made it.
[chuckles]
What took you so long, brother?
Okay, seems like he's playing it pretty cool.
Probably more surprised on the inside.
Uh-huh.
Sir, Gina and I are worried about you.
You're drinking a second can of seltzer.
I need this to settle my nerves.
Hurricane Debbie is approaching.
My little sister Debbie, she's a real drama queen.
[chuckles] The drama queen of the Holt family?
What, did she laugh out loud one time?
She's laughed out loud multiple times.
Sir, you have a pretty low bar for what you consider drama.
Once, I used an exclamation point in a email.
You called me Diana Ross.
I assure you, in this case, I do not exaggerate.
Raymond!
Here.
Judge for yourselves.
Here you are.
Great. Oh, my God.
My trip here from the train station... hey, I swear to you I heard the cab driver mumble under his breath, ""You will die tonight.""
Is that not the most insane thing you have ever heard?
I mean, can you even, Raymond?
I cannot... even.
I hadn't seen her in a while.
She lived alone.
She was 89 years old.
Okay, thanks.
There's no forced entry or visible trauma.
It's probably natural causes.
We'll take a look around...
Sure.
This huge apartment.
What is this, like, 1,800 square feet?
Exposed brick.
Got tons of natural light.
Weird. I thought you'd be most exciting about the gas range.
[gasps] They have a gas range.
I have to apply for this apartment.
I mean, it just became available.
We're the only two people to see it.
This is an opportunity you just don't get in New York real estate ever.
A woman just died here.
Don't be gross and disrespectful.
Holy crap, look at all this closet space.
I'm applying too.
What? You don't need closet space.
You have, like, one outfit.
Just let me have this.
No.
We saw it at the same time.
May the best man win.
Game on.
[clears throat]
I mean, the game of contacting the next of kin.
That's the game I like to play.
Peralta, it's no coincidence you're on a ship.
You won a free cruise without entering a contest.
How do you think that happened?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I bought ""Speed 2"" on DVD, and the Internet realized that cruises were one of my interests.
Great film. Sandy B. in a sarong.
Damn straight.
But the tix are all me.
I brought you here 'cause I'm in peril.
Pfft. Peril.
Don't ""pfft"" my peril.
Pfft.
Somebody's trying to kill me, and I need protection, so I sent for my best friend.
I am not your best friend.
I'm your worst enemy. Get that through your head.
It's this kind of bickering that makes us such an adorable couple.
Whatever, Judy. You're under arrest.
You can't arrest me, boo. We're in international waters, which is also why I can smoke as much weed as I want.
Welcome to the high seas.
No, no way that that's true.
Amy, tell me I can arrest him right now.
Judy's right. We have no jurisdiction.
Technically this boat flies under the flag of Uzbekistan.
Uh-oh. Your girl knows about the Uzbeks. Oh.
But the captain can have him arrested.
He has total authority on this boat.
Perfect. Captains love me.
Just wait until he or she finds out they're employing a criminal.
Yeah, about 40% of the crew are criminals.
[groans]
It's hard to find normal people who want to live on a boat.
I, myself, am a tax evader.
I just need him locked up till we get back to New York.
Can't you just throw him in boat jail?
Both: It's called the brig.
He is my best lounge singer, and I need to keep people distracted.
Just between us, we're nearly out of ranch dressing.
On day one?
These people are animals.
Listen, as long as he's on my boat, Doug Judy is a free man.
[sighs]
Jake, Amy, welcome to my cabin, AKA the Boom-Boom Stateroom.
[gasps]
This is a royale level suite.
I never thought we'd see one in person.
Little perk of being Carousel Cruises' entertainer of the year.
♪ Which I am, girrr-rl ♪
A little pitch-y.
You're welcome to chill here.
It's the least I can do to thank you for protecting me.
Never. This protection scam is a scam.
Do you honestly think you can fool me again just because you've successfully done it numerous times before?
Look, my old boss wants me dead.
I've been laying low on this ship, and I got word from a friend on the inside that they found me, and there's a hitman coming to end my beautiful life.
That's why I sent you the free tickets.
No! No, no way. I'm not buying it.
You can't get away from me again.
Amy and I are gonna spend every second of our romantic cruise watching you, assuming that's okay?
Yep. That's what we're gonna do.
Yeah.
I'll just get rid of this itinerary.
No, no, no, no, Ames, don't put that down.
We have to find the hitman before he finds me.
I'm guessing this'll take us all over the boat.
Oh, yeah, that's an ENAC sitch right there.
""Every Nook And Cranny.""
Perfect. We'll just ENAC sitch, uh, of this bitch.
How's it going with your sister, sir?
Well, last night, she told me in a great detail about a fight she got into with her trainer, whom she accused of stealing a hairbrush.
Now she's on the phone, screaming at our mother.
We'll keep her out of your hair.
I'm good at distracting people.
It's what I do with my toddlers all day long.
How does she feel about balloon animals?
I'm sure she has a complicated relationship with them.
Ray!
Here she comes.
No balloon animals.
You ain't gonna believe Mom's take on this.
She thinks I'm the one who should apologize just 'cause it turns out the hairbrush ended up being in my car.
Yes, I'd love to discuss your hairbrush for even more time, but I have some pressing police matters to attend to.
Look at you. Always working.
What happened to my fun big brother?
Fun? I was never fun. You take that back.
I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it, sir.
When we were little, we would go down in the basement, and he would build us a fort.
We would stay down there all day.
And Ray would sing these silly little made-up songs.
George and Ira Gershwin did not compose silly, made-up songs.
Uh, Debbie, let me show you New York, okay?
The buildings, the subway, the bank, the dry cleaner... I got to run some errands.
Oh, that's a great idea, Gina.
Debbie, I'm so sorry I won't get a chance to see you much on your visit.
Uh, no thing but a chicken wing, 'cause I'm gonna be here for six weeks.
I'ma be all up in your life, okay?
[gasps] I got five down.
I figured out the theme. It's boats.
Okay, I get it.
She's smart and lovable; you're scrappy and lovable; together you're just lovable and lovable.
Okay, so where's this hitman, Judy?
Look, I don't know who they sent, but he's on the boat.
Check out this manifest.
Somebody boarded in San Juan named Henry Coles.
Henry Street and Coles Street, that's the corner of your old chop shop in Brooklyn.
This is an alias.
Mm-hmm.
And my porter buddy checked out Henry Coles' cabin, He hasn't been in it yet.
He's hiding somewhere on this boat ready to jump out and kill me at any moment.
Probably creepin' around in my closet.
Or stowed away in a lifeboat.
Or hiding in a wall.
Or holed up in the engine room.
Camouflaged in the shrubbery.
Both: Predator style.
[grunts] No. We are not having fun.
You will not suck me in with your wily charms.
Señor Gotaro, un café con leche, sin azúcar.
Gracias.
Hola, Mr. Gotaro. Good to see you.
Can I talk to Rosa for a quick sec about some super serious police work?
[whispering] I know what you're trying to do.
You brought him in here to butter him up.
Yeah, and I've been laying it on... real thick.
[static crackles]
Mint?
Okay, but you're making a big mistake.
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.
Of course, you knew that already because you're so smart.
I just did it to you.
[grunts] Fine, little man.
Bring it.
Okay.
Looks like you and I are in a good, old-fashioned suck-off.
Don't call it a suck-off.
Why not? Why shouldn't...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally, yep. Mm-hmm. Right. Smart. Good.
You brought your own shuffleboard stick?
Mm-hmm.
They're called tangs.
You should be glad she has her own.
You don't want her messing with another man's tang.
There is no way they're called tangs.
It's true. They are.
And the disks are called biscuits.
[biscuit scraping]
[whispers] Yes.
Tangs and biscuits?
That is so dumb.
I officially love shuffleboard.
Clear a path! I'm about to whip my biscuit!
Yah!
Whoo.
About time you smiled, Jake.
You've been a real tang in the mud.
All right.
Hey, little advice.
Amy is great.
You want to keep her, be more receptive to her interests.
All right, now you're taking it too far, Judy.
I don't need relationship advice from my criminal archnemesis.
Look, I just want to see you two happy.
No. This is just another one of your lies, just like your fake hitman.
There is a hitman on this boat.
Henry Coles is coming to kill me.
Excuse me?
What?
You said my name.
I'm Henry Coles.
You're Henry Coles?
According to my medical alert bracelet.
Well, this is interesting.
This is Henry Coles. Let's just take a look at that.
Oh, it says, ""Doug Judy is a liar.""
Actually, it says I'm a fall risk.
Okay, you're kind of ruining my burn here, Henry.
I knew it. I knew Henry Coles was a 90-year old man with type 1 diabetes and emphysema.
Obviously, I didn't know those specifics, but I knew you were lying.
So Henry Coles wasn't the guy.
My bad.
There's still somebody on this boat who wants to kill me.
You're trying to get away, and it's not gonna happen.
We're spending the rest of this trip in your cabin.
Amy and I will take sleep shifts to make sure someone's always watching you.
Thank you. That makes me feel super safe.
[lock beeps]
And if you want to smush, I have a sleep mask and noise canceling headphones.
Can't we just lock him up in there?
Do we really have to trade off sleep for the next six nights?
I know. I'm sorry.
But he did say that he'd wear a mask if we want to smush.
Fine. I get it. He's the Pontiac Bandit.
You take the first shift.
Thank you so much. You're the best.

Whatever you gotta tell yourself.
Baby steps. It's hard getting him out of his shell...
[sighs] Tell me about it.
Every time we get emotional, he's like, ""Noice, smort.""
Okay, can we focus up here?
We still don't know what your hitman looks like, so we're gonna have to flush him out.
Wait a minute.
Where do the toilets on this boat go?
You don't want to know.
[gasps] The pool?
Ocean.
Oh, that's even worse.
That's where my shrimp live.
Anyways, he'll probably try to hit me at my show this afternoon.
At least I'll die doing what I love: getting people horny at sea.
Yeah. Yeah. That's gross.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna leave you alone on stage and dangle you as bait.
Damn! Bait dangling?
If we're up on stage with you, it could spook him.
We'll blend into the crowd, and we'll take him down before he even gets to you.

You're under arrest for the murder of your tenant Shirley Crouch.

Is this because I didn't rent to you?
No.
But that was suspicious.
Why wouldn't you want cops with great credit living in your building?
Great credit and an eel hookup.
Because you murdered her.
Toxicology report says the old lady was poisoned.
Her apartment was rent controlled, and you couldn't jack up the price until she was out of there.
I just have one last question.
If you go to jail, who makes the rental decisions in the building?
It'll pass to a trust.

Cagney can write a lowercase L.
It's just a line, right?

Look, I worked hard to get us included in that pilot program.
Body cams are important, and I need these field tests to go well.
I'm gonna go take my position.

Unique New York. Unique New York.
Unique New York.
I took a Toastmasters class to prepare for tonight.
Seriously, it's gonna be fine.
We're just gonna have some dinner, eat dessert, play charades, and then talk for half an hour about which of her friends are sick.
We're gonna play charades?

You wait until t-minus two seconds to tell me that?
Okay. Movie. Book.
What's the thing for song? I don't know the thing for song.

Hi, birthday boy.
Hi.
Mom, is something on fire?
Yeah.
Okay.
You must be Amy.
Let me take you in.
Okay.
I'll just take in this gorgeous front door of yours.
Mom, seriously, the fire?
It's fine.
Things don't burn down like they used to.
I'm just gonna put it out.
Well, you know, it's good enough for Diane Keaton.
It's good enough for me.
I love her.
I mean, she's no Jane Seymour.
Where is Jane Seymour now, anyway?
She makes jewelry, and it's beautiful.
I just bought two brooches for the lesbians across the street.
Mom, I keep telling you, if you don't rein it in a little bit, you're gonna scare them off.
Well, that's what you said about Carla, and I ignored it, and now I have a friend with one arm.
I stand corrected.
[doorbell rings]
Oh, must be your birthday surprise.
You got the '86 Mets?
Be warned, a lot of them turned out to be drug addicts, so this could be a bummer.
You ready?
Hey, buddy.
Happy birthday.
Dad? What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
Yeah, well I am surprised that you know it's my birthday.
Actually, Jake... your father and I are, uh, seeing each other again.
Oh!
Wow, that's... that's so interesting.
[pop]
Oh...
I know this isn't the best time, but we are in your childhood bedroom, and I do have one question: did you have a nose ring in high school?
Yes. Until it got infected and I almost went blind.
Don't tell anyone.
Cool. It's our secret.
Just gonna check my email up high.
No new messages.
Amy, can we focus?
What is going on here? Why is my dad dating my mom?
What does he want?
Money, but she's a public school art teacher.
That doesn't make any sense. [snaps]
Maybe that son of a bitch wants his picture drawn!
Jake, Karen is a grown woman with a pretty respectable credit score.
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
Amy, I know that you have a binder, but you don't know her like I do.
She's too trusting for her own good.
She's fallen for more Nigerian scams than Scully.
She's fallen for 20 Nigerian scams?
20?
That's insane.
No, she's fallen for 2. Scully's fallen for 20?
[scoffing] Yeah.
Look, all right, you know what?
This is fine.
It's just the same that it's always been.
I have to protect her.
I'm gonna go down there, and I'm going to express my concerns to her in a calm, rational manner.
[yelling] What are you doing, Mom?
He's evil!
[gravelly voice] I'm glad we got these sweet cams.
What is happening with your voice?
This is Body Cam Charles.
I got to sound badass in case anybody watches the footage, capisce?
[shrilly] Aah!
Oh, I just spilled soup on the cam!
Why do you have soup on a stakeout?
Oh, no. Crap!
Oh, it's not turning back on.
Do you think Sarge is gonna be mad that I spilled ""fuh"" on the cam?
He definitely will if you say pho like that when you tell him.
I'm not gonna mispronounce it.
Not while you're rolling.
Go get yourself cleaned up!
[groans]
See anything, Sarge?
Not yet.
Don't know why I didn't go undercover as someone wearing a scarf.
Terry hates windchill.
Wait, here's our guy.
Got him.
Crap! I think he made me.
He's headed toward the restaurant!
You follow. I'll cover the back alley!

Ah!
Rosa?
Charles.
You're completely naked.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
[sighs]
Where is everyone, Gina?
Perhaps that's tonight's first puzzle.
I forgot to send the invitations.
But I was able to rally the best and brightest of those available.
Oh, dear God.
Sorry we're late.
Turns out the front door was a push, not a pull.
Well, maybe we should just reschedule.

You have three hours to find the four keys that will prevent the apocalypse and release you from this room.
Your time starts now.
Well, this is a sobering reality.
Okay, I got your favorite cake: blue.
I'm not hungry.
It's a figure of speech. Obviously, I'll have some.
You know, I don't think our guest Amy really wants to talk about this, Jake.
Can we just move on?
Yes. Maybe we could talk about someone we all admire: President Jimmy Carter.
When I think of the great...
So how serious is it, Hmm?
Have you guys kissed?
Has he stayed the night?
Has he brought you a chocolate orange from the airport?
'Cause that's his big move.
Jake, your mother and I have been seeing each other for three months.
Oh, you know what?
I oughta throw up in your face.
I know that you're angry, but when I was here last year, you really showed me what a selfish jerk I was.
You're the reason that all of this is happening.
Yeah, but I didn't want this.
I just wanted you to text me Mb dad joke every six months.
I can do that. Just give me your number.
You didn't save my number?
Now, Jake, look.
I know every mistake your father has made, and he says they're all in the past.
Now just blow out your candles.
Okay, great.
Great idea, Mom.
I'll blow out my birthday candles.
[inhales deeply]
[blows]
[whispering] I wished that you would leave.
Damn it, I shouldn't have said it out loud. Now it won't come true.



Okay, we have maps, a pantry, beds, a desk.
Where should we begin?
Do you have any experience with puzzles?
Yes.
I've never solved one.
This says we have three questions.
No.
Uh-oh.
How do we get outta here?
Can't tell you.
Really?
 Yes.
That's enough!
Sorry about that.
Can we please have our questions back?
No.
And that's three.
You're done.
Oh, Captain, how could you?
Hey.
You didn't come back down.
I had to talk to your parents for, like, an hour, and I ran out of stuff from the binder, and then I did something really weird.
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout ♪
♪ Down came... ♪
So... do you know where the nearest train station is?
I know it sucks that I did that, but think about how I feel.
My stupid parents are borking each other.
And my mom thinks she knows all the worst things that my dad did, but she has no idea.
She doesn't even know that he cheated on her with her best friend, Sheila Bodden.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I saw them.
They were in our car in the garage having s*x.
It's the whole reason I can't have s*x in cars in garages.
That's a very specific sexual hang-up.
I mean, has it really held you back?
Well, are we having s*x in car in a garage right now?
No. So, yeah, big time it's held me back.
I never told her about it 'cause I didn't want to crush her heart, but... now I have to use it.
I'm gonna tell my dad if he doesn't do the decent thing and leave my mom again...
I'm dropping the Sheila bomb.
Whoa.
I know this is a really big deal, but I have to ask.
Did you wear this hat in high school?
Amy!
There's only one way I'm gonna get my dad alone.
You have to tell my mom that you need to speak with her in private.
About what?
I barely know her.
Tell her you're plugged up and you need a laxative.
What? No!
What? I'm not gonna say that.
Okay, here's the plan: I drop the bomb during charades.
I'll just tell him I know about Sheila... with my body.
Um...
Fast, uh, fast... ""Fast and Furious""?
""Magic Mike""?
[mutters] I don't know...
Uh, ""Crying Game""?
I don't know.

[groans] Ah!
Both: Oh.
I... I didn't...
No, no, no.
It's fine. I... it's... I'm...
Um, right, why would you be?
Yeah, it's not like I'm always, uh...
[strained] Naked.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Look, man, no one's ever gonna see that footage.
The case was cut and dry.
It's not like I'm dying to tell anyone I saw your...
Bennie and the Jets.
[chuckles] Sure.
Whatever.
Hey, I've been looking for you guys.
I just talked to our perp's attorney.
He's claiming the drugs you seized in the bathroom weren't his.
What?
But we saw him throw them in the garbage.
Yeah.
Normally, it'd be your word against his, but lucky for us, you were wearing body cams!
Yeah, but the thing about cameras is that they don't really tell the full objective truth.
Images can be distorted. People often seem naked.
Boyle, what are you talking about?
Boyle is fully nude in the footage.
[yelling] Why?
The whole thing?
[clear throat loudly]
No, no, no.
Not the whole thing. Okay.
[panting]
It doesn't matter how much humping I do.
He's still not getting it.
[sighs] Okay.
Well... then this is happening.
Hey, Karen, can I talk to you for a second in private?
I'm a little plugged up.
Oh, well, say no more.
I have an entire cabinet devoted just to that.
Wow. TMI, you guys.
[chuckles]
[mouthing] Thank you.
Oh, man, this is so much fun.
Thanks for giving me a second chance, buddy.
Second chance?
Are you seriously not getting what I'm charades-ing down at you?
That was you and Sheila Bodden humping it up in the back of our car.
What? I...
Yeah, that's right. I saw you.
I saw your weird dad butt, and I saw her aquamarine leotard bunched up around her ankles!
It scarred me for life.
I'm sorry. I... I didn't know you saw that.
Yeah, well, I did, and I never told Mom about it, but I swear to you, I will unless you leave right now.
Should be easy for you since it's your favorite thing to do aside from humping it up with ladies.
You think I'm way more sexually active than I am.
I mean, I've only had s*x with, like, 400 women.
What?
400? Oh, my God.
Is that a lot?
I mean, all my friends are pilots.
I'm on the low end of average.
[sighs]
Listen.
I don't want to hurt your mother.
Please... don't tell her about Sheila.
Fine, I won't, provided you leave right now.
Your move, white devil.
So if I'm correct, this should contain... key number one!
Yay. Open the door.
Oh, we need to find four keys.
And it took half our time just to find this one because I had to do it completely alone.
You're all useless.
Sorry. I've been a little busy trying to solve the puzzle of how does one man chew so loud with just one mouth?

Where's your father?
Oh, Roger, you mean?
He left very suddenly.
Said something about ""being the worst.""
What did you say to him, Jake?
What?
Why do you assume that I said something?
He's a leaving jerk, so he left like a jerk.
This is what he does.
He's not a monster.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that if you knew everything that he's done.
What did he do, Jake?
Nothing. You know, just, like super-awful life-changing things.
No follow-up questions.
Is it worse than the time he cheated on me with Sheila Bodden?
Ah.
You knew about that?
Yeah.
I knew about that.

She left it in our bathroom.

And also, remember your turtle, Graham Crackers?
Dad had s*x with my turtle?
No, no, no, no, but he... he stepped on it getting out of bed.
But you said Graham Crackers got married and moved in with his wife.
How did I not know any of this stuff?
Well, because you were a kid, and kids don't actually know a lot about their parents.
Jake, I've dated a lot of men in the last 20 years.
You have?
A lot.
Okay, you don't have to put so much mustard on it.
And I haven't met anyone I like.
But I like your father.
And I know he has been a selfish jerk, but he really has changed.
Last month when I had bronchitis, he flew in on his day off just to bring me soup.
It was this weird Canadian soup.
I-I think it was just all cheese.
But it was really nice.
[sighs] Man, I feel stupid.
I was just trying to protect you, but I clearly made everything worse.
You have been protecting me since you were a kid.
Sometimes I think you got so good at it, you decided to become a cop and protect everyone.
Oh, that's a cool thought, but I became a cop because of ""Die Hard.""
I love you.
I love you, too, Mom.
Come here.
[sighs]
You know, I'm probably remembering a lot more nakedness than there actually was.
No, you're not.
Also, no one's gonna see it on that little TV.
Great news.
We were able to snag the new flat screen.

Your honor, Mr. Tran claims that he had no narcotics on him.
Fortunately, our detectives were equipped with body cams.
Someone's in here!

I think we all clearly saw where Mr. Tran threw the drugs in the trash right before he was apprehended.
At least it's over now.
Really? How do we know those were drugs?
Please back that tape up.
No! Objection!
On what grounds?
That's my pen1s?
Overruled.
Hey, man, look at that and tell me what you see.
A naked fool.
No. Between the thighs and under the testicles, there's a bag of cocaine.
A bag of cocaine that's gonna get us a conviction and prove the value of body cams.
You know what I see? A naked hero.
You're right, Sarge. Thank you.
Now let's zoom in.
[all groan]
Whoop! Over-zoomed.
Well, well, well.
Look who's trying to skip town.
You told me to.
Right.
Look, I talked to Mom, and I just want her to be happy.
So can we go back to my birthday party now?
I'd love that, son.
This is nice.
If you screw this up and hurt her in any way, I will throw you in jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, Dad, so do not test me.
[clears throat] Okay.
I still liked the hug even though you used it to threaten me.
Yeah, well...
I kind of liked threatening you, so...
Come on.
Okay, so we found key number three, thanks to Scully.
I was gonna eat those peaches anyway.
That leaves just one more key.

The auction for...
The Suitcase of Mystery!
Exactly, Jacob.
This puppy's been in the lost and found since 1976.

Yeah, okay, it sounds pretty cool, but Jake and I already talked how we'd play this.
We had a pretty sweet convo about it.
Remember?
I think we should do surveillance, collect intel, and build a case.
Sure.
So, we all got stories, pal.
Look. We need information.
If we bust in there and Ozerov doesn't have any drugs, our whole operation is blown.
But I know this guy, all right?
He never works out of one place for long.
I guarantee you he has drugs on him and if we don't get him now, we never will.
Well, too bad for you, because Jake agrees with me.
We're always on the same...
Page?
Yes! Told you.
Actually, Charles, I think Stevie's right.
No. You said ""page.""
I know, but he knows this case, and I trust his gut.
But, hey, let's go catch a bad guy together, right?
Gear up, Police Pals!
Hey, what is that?
Thought we were Beatsie Boys.
You didn't even tell him.
[muffled heavy rock music]
Rosa, do you need to listen to it that loud?
Yes!
I'm trying to drown out the sound from Ellen, the chat factory, over there.
My daughter got me a juicer for Christmas.
Did you know that you can juice nuts?
What?
I'm two seconds away from juicing Ellen.
I know it's tough, but Sarge...
Ah, no, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Shoo! Shoo!
Oh, can you at least put her on a leash?
She's a medical professional. Okay?
Would you keep a doctor on a leash?
That dog does not help you with your foot pain.
You just want an excuse to bring her everywhere!
Your dog is a fraud.
Fraud dog!
Come on.
Fraud dog! Fraud dog!
Fraud dog!
Juice Ellen!
Juice Ellen!
Fraud dog!
Whoa!
Both of you, outside now!



I know it's crowded in there and they're not very considerate guests and they took my mouse and then they took my keyboard and then they took the whole computer.
And when I had nothing else to give, they came for my yogurt.
No, not just any yogurt.
Full fat Greek with a touch of honey.
That's a once a week treat!
[microwave beeping]
What the hell are you guys doing out here?
Finally eating breakfast.
We snuck the microwave out here so we could cook our burritos like real policemen.
Now they have to use the toaster oven.
Enjoy your 16-minute cook times, idiots.
Guys, this is amazing.
Back off, it's our microwave! Ours!
[growls]
Nobody wants your microwave!
But look, the nine-eight's stuff is blocking the windows.
They can't see us out here.
It's so peaceful... and spacious.
This could be our new beginning.
All right.
Can't let Ozerov ditch the drugs.
We got to go in fast and strong.
I don't know about you, but I can use some adrenalin.
A little slap-slap-boom?
Mm.
What's slap-slap-boom?
Oh, it's just this thing we used to do to get each other pumped up where we slap each other in the face; you don't have to do it.
No, I want to. I want to go first.
[slaps] Ow!
[slaps] Ooh! Ooh!
Shh. There's movement.
But I'm the only one who got slapped in the face.
Charles, we gotta go!
NYPD! Show me your hands!
Hey, Ozerov, I'll have a martini with a twist.
The twist? You're under arrest.
None for me; I'm driving... you to jail.
He's clean. There's no drugs on him.
Damn it.
We wasted those cool lines on nothing.
Also, we blew the case.
That's obviously much worse.
That was my first thought.
Look, I know that we didn't find any drugs, but I still think it was worth the risk.
Well, I think it was a crap circus.
This whole operation is blown.
If you ask me, the Beatsie Boys should be called the Thoroughly Messed-Up Millies.
What?
I can't even imagine what you're going for.
I was being devastating!
Look, man, I get that you're pissed, but I am telling you, Ozerov is dirty.
Maybe, but if we had staked the bar out, we could've built up cases against a dozen guys here.
This place is filled with criminals.
I brought him in last month.
Hey, Detective Boyle.
Hi, Isaac.
The only good thing is, now this whole trio doesn't have to work together anymore.
Yes it does. Charles, you did it.
You saved the case.
What? Why? I didn't want to.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but consorting with known felons is a parole violation, meaning we have grounds to search Ozerov's home.
Hell yeah! Jakey P with the save!
Well, you know, Boyle is the one who pointed it out.
He deserves the credit.
True, true, true.
Good job, Earl!
You know my name is Charles.
So, if we're gonna start a secret office on the roof, we need equipment.
That means chairs, desks, printers, pens.
But we gotta sneak it out, so we need a distraction.
Okay, here is what I'm thinking.
We give that dog a bunch of chocolates.
It dies.
While everyone celebrates...
Okay, Amy's too close to this.
Rosa, you got any ideas?
Hitchcock and Scully just set fire to the kitchen sink.
Oh, boy. Ooh, boy.
Perfect!
Let's use that.
I looked everywhere. I didn't find anything.
Did you?
No.
But mirror top coffee table, iguana cage, samurai swords on the wall... either this guy is a drug dealer or uses an incautious interior designer.
He might be a drug dealer, but we have nothing on him.
Quick question, guys.
Why did the drug dealer never do his dishes?
Because he has drugs in his dishwasher.
Oh, yeah!
Dishwasher?
Hit me.
Here, is for you.
Hello?
Hey.
What's up, dude? It's me.
We got the drugs, man.
Hang on, Charles wants to say hi.
Do you have any milk?
Not a stranger in sight.
It's beautiful.
I've never heard the printer sound so happy.
I feel like it knows.
We did it.
A new world.
This must be how the founding fathers felt.
So... what are you doing out here?
Captain, it's mayhem in there.
Those people are messy and selfish.
And chatty.
And out here, we can actually get work done.
But...
Sir, I'll handle this.
We love it.
We're proud of you.
We want in.
No.
You're acting like little children playing basketball who've fallen behind by several two-pointer buckets so you just take your basket home, and now no one else can play.
I know it's not the time, but you gotta watch basketball if you're gonna try to reference it.
Sergeant, this is boorish behavior.
I wanted you to be a good host.
You told me to make it work, and I came up with a creative solution.
Diaz finished her arrest reports.
Santiago did the filing of ten men.
I don't want to hear it.
Just clean up this mess and get back inside.
[printer beeping]
Paper jam.
It does know.
Attenzione, dingbats.
Perchance a riddle. Shakespeare.
What has six thumbs and just arrested a drug dealer?
Both: These guys.
[chuckles]
Charles, thumbs up.
I said ""six thumbs"" and we're only showing four.
We're starting to look like fools.
Come on, Charles.
There it is.
That's the ticket.
Whoo!
All right, man, I'm gonna go check with Flynt.
You do some research on where we're gonna celebrate tonight.
Here's my only requirement: it has to be at your house 'cause I ain't got no money.
Uh, okay, how about at my house?
Swurt.
[both laughing]
Yes!
[sighs]
Psst, hey.
What are you doing?
Come here.
What?
I think Stevie's bad news.
What? Oh, come on, Charles.
You know, you've been acting weird about Stevie all day.
I think you might be jealous.
Of course I'm jealous.
I was never hiding that.
How?
He's tall. He's funny.
He can pull off an earring.
He doesn't have an earring.
But we both know he'd look good with one.
Oh, my God... What do you want me to say, Boyle?
I've been trying to include you in this all day long.
And, yes, I forgot you that one time, but I made up for it.
I slapped you in the face.
You're supposed to be my friend.
I'm an adult man, I can have two close friends.
Hell, I can have three close friends.
You wouldn't.
I would.
[scoffs]
Maybe I'll get in touch with my friend James from college.
Ooh, or you know who just looked me up online?
Brad from camp.
Stevie planted the drugs.
Come on!
I looked on that dishwasher before him, and it was empty.
Stevie planted those pills.
But you're right, he's the coolest!
You guys should go get your ears pierced together.
Invite Brad. It'll be smurt.
It's swurt, not smurt.
So, joke it's on you.
Damn it, Stevie!
Hey, I logged the drugs.
You know what that means. It's time to celebrate.
You know what that means. Let's eat big sandwiches!
I gotta talk to you... in private.
Come on.
Okay.
Uh, this is cozy.
Well, the precinct is so crowded, this is the only place no one can hear us talk.
[deep breath] Listen.
I know you planted the drugs at Ozerov's place.
What?
Charles checked the dishwasher, and he didn't see any drugs.
Yeah, well, they were there. All right?
I guess he just missed them.
Probably busy hiking up his pants above this belly button.
He has to do that because they don't make pants short enough for him.
Look. Don't lie to me, man.
Dude, the guy is a drug dealer.
All right?
I wasn't gonna let him walk again.
But you get it, though, right?
You're not a tight-ass like Charles.
You know, I wish I was like Charles.
He's a good cop and an honest person, and when we go on stakeouts, we do listen to Toni Braxton and it's super sad and it's awesome.
I can't believe I'm saying this, Stevie, but I gotta report you.
Ow!
Did you just Donkey Kong punch me?
There's no room to regular punch you.
[both grunting]
Ooh, all right.
It's on.
Ahh!
What's going on?
He did plant the drugs.
You trusted me.
Oww!
Son of a bitch! I hope there's room in this fight for three.
There's not.
You have a 2:30 meeting with small head big body.
I forgot to take his name.
D.A. Brayburn.
Deputy Inspector Flynt, do you mind if we have a meeting here in the office?
Actually, I do mind.
I'm not really in the mood for company.
I just had a bad loss in an online poker game.
Of course.
Anything for our guests.
Get back here, you crap basket.
You're going down!
Help!
He's attacking me for no reason!
[both grunt, all gasp]
Stevie Schillens, you have the right to remain...
A loser.
Noice.
But, now legally, I have to start over, Charles.
Stevie Schill... Oh!
[all gasp]
Get off him. We just made up.
[grunting]
Paul?
I thought we had something.
[grunts]
Get nine-eight.
[all chattering]
Hope your dog will help with neck pain.
Oh! She doesn't help with any pain.
I made it up.
Ha! I knew it!
Hey, Ellen.
I got your farm girl.
You wouldn't.
Bessy!
Terry got his computer back.
[grunts]
Oh, come on!
[yelling and groaning]
Sarge, take off your shirt!
It's restricting your movement.
[bullhorn blares]
What the hell is going on here?
Yeah.
What are you guys doing?
Brawling with other police officers?
What were you thinking?
Sir, I had nothing to do with this.
I was arresting a dirty cop.
I heard you scream out ""I love this!""
Yes.
""This"" being justice.
I love justice.
And to make matters worse, our radiator was broken during your wild street-ball scrum.
So now we have no heat.
Which means we'll have to work in the freezing cold, and our guests from the nine-eight will have to relocate again.
No smiles. No smiles.
This is a sad day for our precinct.
Dismissed.
[all grumbling]
Captain.
You know what's kinda weird?
There was no one was fighting over by the radiator.
You were the only person standing near it.
I suppose, in the hubbub, I may have tripped and busted a pipe.
[all yelling, metallic clank]
[steam hissing]
I knew it!
I knew you couldn't stand having someone in your space.
He used my letter opener to cut his tuna sandwich in half!
You were right.
They were disrespectful and had to go.
And, yes, sometimes you have to come up with a creative solution.
And sometimes just a bunch of dudes need to get into a room and just... [grunting]
""Take that! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!""
That's not the lesson here.
Okay, Captain.

Hey, Gina! We got an anonymous gift basket.
Yeah, it's full of treats.
It's got meats, cheeses, candies, all the food groups.
The cheese is amazing.
It melts in my mouth and in my hands.
Hmm, French chocolates, French cheeses, tiny French pickles.
Did none of you detectives think this might be a gift for Captain Holt from someone in France?
Like his husband, par exemple?
What? [laughs] No way.
This is a nice present from an unknown, appreciative citizen that wanted us to munch.
Hmm, what's this, then?
""Dear Captain Raymond Holt, thinking of you.
Best, Dr. Kevin Cozner, Ph.D.""
He even used their pet names.
Oh, no, I ate the chocolate-covered strawberry.
That's the most intimate snack of them all.
Holt's gonna be back from his meeting in 30 minutes.
What do we do?
Eat the note!
No! No.
It's okay. We can fix this.
Check it out, sir.
A lovely gift basket that Kevin sent you all the way from Paris.
Straight from Paris!
Stapler, scissors.
Rubber bands.
That man really knows me.
[all laugh]
♪ ♪
Attention, squad. I just received a call.
A very important, very high profile celebrity was robbed in our precinct.
What celebrity, sir? Is it a Chris?
Hemsworth? Evans? Pratt? Pine? Brown? Cross?
[gasps] Is it a non-Chris?
This is a sensitive matter, and I can only disclose details to the lead detective on the case.
Sergeant, let me know who's available, ASAP.
Yes, sir.
Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.
You know that I'm your guy for this.
You can't give a celebrity case to Amy.
The last movie she saw was a documentary about spelling bees.
Wrong; it was about the font Helvetica, and it played like an action thriller.
You already have a case, Peralta.
I assigned it to you this morning.
That was just some kid with a little bit of pot on him.
Meanwhile, Chris Rock is tied up in his basement calling out for my help, and you're standing in my way.
Just work the case I assigned you.
Can't I just give my case to Hitchcock and Scully?
I mean, they clearly have a ton of time on their hands.
Hitchcock hasn't even gotten out of his chair today.
Hey, Jake, I can go anywhere in this thing.
But... shouldn't.
Hitchcock and Scully are house mouses.
They do paperwork and they're good at it.
They don't go out in the field.
Boyle, you take the celebrity case.
Me? Instead of Jake?
Have you lost your damn mind? I am so sorry, Jake.
I don't know what's wrong with Terry.
Don't worry. I'm gonna work it with you.
I'm giving my drug bust to Hitchcock and Scully.
It's time to get these mice out of their hice.
Oh, that was lame. Life is meaningless.
We're all gonna die.
Mouses out of their houses. Yes, I am the greatest.
Every breath is a gift. Sorry about the roller coaster.
I'm just happy I'm tall enough to ride.
Hey, Rosa.
Saw you hadn't signed up for the blood drive yet, so I brought you the sheet.
Sorry, can't. I'm... under 17 years old.
Wait, you didn't sign up last year, either.
Or the year before.
Are you afraid of needles?
I don't like being stabbed by someone so they can steal my blood.
I'm crazy.
This is amazing; you're scared of something I'm not.
I'm tougher than you. I'm tougher than Rosa.
Eh, I take it back. I'm so sorry.
Look, it's okay. We all have fears.
I'm so claustrophobic, I can't even go into the downstairs supply closet.
I hear they have some hot new binder clips, but I'll never know.
I'm scared of businessmen.
A whole army of gray-suited Brads and Chads trying to suck my soul and redeem it for frequent flyer miles.
Great, so you guys get it.
Conversation over, bye.
No, no, no, no, no.
What if we each agree to face one of our fears today for ourselves and for all of womenkind?
Ugh. That sounds terrible.
But I'm in.
Fine, I'll do it too.
Guys, come on.
I really think this'll be good for... oh, wait.
You... we're doing my thing? Okay.
Thanks for taking us to lunch, Jake.
Of course. Get whatever you want.
Oh, man, I already ate.
I guess I'll just have a cheeseburger deluxe, couple slices of pie, maybe an egg cream.
Okay.
And a waffle.
So look, a big, important drug case came across my desk, and I need your help.
Only problem is, Sarge doesn't think you can handle it.
He's right.
No, he's not.
Look, you're Hitchcock and Scully.
You guys are legends.
You single-handedly caught the Prospect Park Flasher.
Well, he was being chased by other cops, but he did slip on my spilled chili.
And who bumped into Scully, causing the spill? Me.
Damn right, and who fell asleep under their desks and caught the janitor stealing evidence?
We did.
And who sued the department and got triple-ply toilet paper in every precinct?
We did.
Terry thinks you guys are too old and too lazy to handle this, but I know what you're really made of.
You're gonna take this case and prove him wrong!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
We're still gonna eat lunch, right?
Obviously, a high profile celebrity case such as this one needs to be handled with the utmost discretion.
I promise I'll be professional, even if it's Dianne Wiest.
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm gonna meet Dianne Wiest!
She's so sexual!
No, our victim... is John... William...
Weichselbraun.
Remind me who that is again?
You're kidding. He's a world-renowned oboist, first chair with the New York Symphony Orchestra.
Kevin and I are huge fans of Weichselbraun's work.
We are what the Internet sometimes refers to as...
Weichselbraun fans.
Not Weichselbrauniacs?
Oh, that's very good.
I'm gonna use that liberally.
Anyway, Weichselbraun's $40,000 oboe was stolen from his apartment, and you need to find it.
I'd work the case myself if it didn't smack of preferential treatment.
Don't worry, sir. I can handle this.
So you do think it smacks of preferential treatment?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Okay, you've convinced me. I'll work the case with you.
Great.
I think you owe me an apology.
I'll apologize to you in hell.
I actually don't know what this is about.
Sorry I took such a hard stance.
Holt's celebrity was just some lame oboist.
Meanwhile, we just linked your little dumb pot bust to a major narcotics ring.
This might be the biggest drug case the Nine-Nine's had in years.
Cool.
Uh-oh.
I know a real ""cool"" when I hear one.
That wasn't a real ""cool."" What did you do?
Well...
I may have given that very huge drug case to Hitchcock and Scully.
What?
In my defense, I was pretty sure you were never gonna find out.
I don't know where Hitchcock and Scully are.
They're not answering their phones, and they signed our dealer... the one link to our drug ring... out of holding.
I swear, if they mess up this case, Jake, it's on you.
They're detectives.
They've been on the force for 500 years.
They know what they're doing.
The only item on Scully's calendar for the entire year is ""eat peanut butter.""
Yeah, we got to find them.
And to do that, we have to think like they do.
I'm going in.
All right, there's the butt indentation, and...
[grunts]
I'm docked.
Ugh. Still warm.
All right, residual cushion fart is about a six out of ten.
He's been gone an hour, maybe two.
But where?
Hot dogs.
They went for hot dogs.
How do you know?
There's a water stain on the ceiling in the shape of a bun.
Let's go.
Excuse me, have you seen Hitchcock and Scully?
Three times a day for 12 years.
Twice as often since I started serving sweet wieners.
Sweet wieners?
It's a normal hot dog with a little chocolate sauce.
One please!
No, Jake.
No, Terry.
Have you seen them recently?
Half hour ago... they ate, and then they took off in a hurry.
[sighs] Half an hour.
They could be anywhere by now. Nope, there's Scully.
Where's Hitchcock?
I'm taking you guys off your drug case.
Of course you are.
Jake said you didn't believe in us.
What? He didn't believe in you either.
He was just pumping you up with lies so you'd work his case.
Jake, is this true?
I just thought, you know, the two of you might be better off mousing around the old house.
Oh, I get it.
Just because I got my finger stuck in a glue trap once, I'm a mouse?
I got the cheese out, by the way.
Oh, my God.
Look, man, we need to know where Hitchcock is.
I am ordering you to tell us everything.
Fine. We're setting up a sting.
I'm going undercover as Tex Dallas, billionaire oil man from Dallas, Texas, with ties to the cowboy mafia.
Oh, boy.
Hitchcock's my middle man, Reno Vegas, mobster from Reno, Las Vegas.
I said my ""oh, boy"" too soon.
In 20 minutes, he's going in totally alone, unarmed, without a cell phone, to meet with one of their guys to set up a buy.
So how do you like our plan now?
It's a disaster, man! We got to stop it!
Disaster? Tell me one thing that's wrong with Operation Beans.
Operation Beans?
Good afternoon, sir. I'm Detective Charles Boyle...
From the Nine-Nine.
My precinct. I'm the captain, Raymond Holt.
Okay. Uh, please, come on in.
I'll show you the back room where they broke in.
You're an incredibly gracious host, Mr. Weichselbraun.
Wow, that pronunciation is flawless.
[laughs]
I must admit, I'm a bit of a Weichselbrauniac.
Hmm, I saw you perform Bach's ""Oboe Sonata in G Minor"" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
I was in the front row.
You were escorted out for gasping too loudly.
Ah.
This is a pretty modest apartment.
How did you afford a $40,000 oboe in the first place?
I admit that there's not as much money in classical music as there once was...
Which is the real crime here.
Boyle, can I talk to you privately?
Sure.
What are you doing? You just insulted our celebrity victim to his face.
You keep saying ""celebrity,"" but he's drying his socks on a George Foreman grill.
This is John William Weichselbraun, the Silver Spit Prince.
I'm making myself primary detective on this case.
You can wait in the car.
Oh, but first, take a picture of the two of us together.
Make sure we're laughing.
Ha-ha!
[chuckles]
Ah.
Okay, so, I'm going to face my fear of confined spaces.
When I'm ready, you will shut the trunk and leave me here for 30 minutes.
I left a juice box and a diaper in there for you, so you're gonna be fine.
Or we could all give in to our fears and keep our blood in our bodies like normal people.
No, Rosa, we are doing something important here.
We are women, standing up and supporting each other and becoming...
New fear: listening to Amy inspire us.
Be back in a half hour, Ames.
Wait! Come back!
Come back, I can't do this!
No, you're the best!
[laughs]



You did it. How'd it go?
Well, the first ten minutes were really terrible.
The diaper did not fit. It was for a baby.
But then I relaxed, and I found my inner strength.
I think the lesson here is that, as women, we...
No, no, no, no!
You close that trunk again and I will kill you!
You hear me? I will kill you!
We're almost there. Slow down, Pinto.
I didn't agree to a bean name.
We are not doing Operation Beans.
You know, the only reason Hitchcock and I took this case is because you said we were great.
I'm beginning to think you were lying to us.
I was lying! I already admitted that.
Well, if anything happens, it's because of you.
Right, Mung?
Right.
If Hitchcock dies, it's 'cause of Pinto.
Terry, I know that you're mad, but you don't have to jump on the bean train.
Uh-oh.
Chickpea! No!
Looks like they're taking Hitchcock inside that building, and it looks like they're armed.
Dammit, Jake!
You couldn't just do the case I assigned you?
Hitchcock's life is in danger. He has a wife, man.
Don't worry. If anything happens to him, she'll be taken care of.
If I die, I want you to marry Lucille.
I can't stand the thought of you being alone.
Deal. Let's make it a blood pact.
Oh, look, I'm already bleeding.
So just normal friend stuff.
So what's the plan?
We stick with Operation Beans.
We knock on the front door. I say I'm Tex Dallas.
You're my buddy, Alamo, and you're Black Fred.
Black Fred? Why Black Fred?
There's no other Fred!
Yeah, but they don't know that.
I say Terry and I go in through the roof and do some recon.
Scully, you stay here and call for backup in case we need it.
Oh, no way.
That's my partner in there. I'm going in.
Also, I can't call for help. I don't have any quarters.
Hard to argue with that logic.
You know I...
Sir, I need to talk to you about the Weichselbraun case.
Oh, I didn't realize you were here, Mr. Weichselbraun.
I was in the area, and the captain is a fan, so I came by to give him a little gift, as a thank you.
It's a signed copy of his book of mouth exercises.
""Reed It and Weep."" ""Reed"" with two Es?
It's my favorite joke of all time.
I'll come back later.
Oh, nonsense.
I'm sure John... he insists I call him ""John""...
I'm sure John would appreciate an update on the whereabouts of his oboe, wouldn't you, John?
Yeah.
Well said, John.
Did you hear what John said?
I did, but it's an open investigation, and I don't think it's proper to share information with the parties involved.
Well, that's why you're no longer the primary.
John played oboe for Lynne Cheney.
I'm sure we can trust him to be discreet.
Out with it.
Okay, well, John, you're under arrest.
What?
Excuse me?
He staged the robbery for the insurance money because he's broke, because oboists are not celebrities.
This is ludicrous, Boyle.
Do you have one iota of evidence?
I found the oboe for sale online.
We traced the IP address back to Mr. Weichselbraun's computer.
Oh, John.
Okay, Sarge, everyone knows you're a superhero, so you lower Scully and I into that skylight and then fly down to meet us.
You know that's impossible.
Fine.
We'll lower Scully down together, and then flop onto him like a giant mattress.
No, you go first, then I lower Scully, and you... you get to catch him.
Great. I love that plan.
[quietly] Come on.
Whoa!
[both grunting]
I got him.
Look what I found.
French fries?
What? No, it's Hitchcock.
Where would I have found French fries in a weed farm?
Oh, man, look at him. This is bad.
He hates standing up.
To conquer my fear of businessmen, I must walk among them.
I will shake their clammy hands and listen to them talk about things like how hard Wednesdays can be.
Does this outfit look drab and lifeless enough?
Also, thanks, Amy, for letting me borrow it.
You're welcome. I wore that suit to prom.
Student chaperone.
I guess this is really happening.
[inhales]
How about those quarterly write-offs?
And did you hear about the merger?
Also, we all need to go in on those flowers for Beth.
Aw, Wednesdays.
Who are you again?
Gina, from Sales. I have the plant on my desk.
Oh, yeah. You want to sit with us.
We'll all be dead so soon.
What?
I would love to sit.
Ugh.
That was a nightmare. I ate a Caesar salad wrap.
I'm so proud of you, you lioness.
You faced your fear.
And I emerged victorious.
Yay!
[sighs]
That was a wig?
You didn't think I'd put my actual hair in a ponytail?
Are you insane?
Oh, there's the boss.
I ask only one time. Who do you work for?
DEA? FBI? Police?
I'm in the cowboy mafia.
I work for the Dallas Buyers Club.
I came up with that name.
No, you didn't.
It's a movie about AIDS.
You're lying. Let's try again.
FBI?
Oof!
DEA?
[grunts]
Police?
Aah!
Oh no, he's not gonna last.
Oh, Jake, you got to do something.
I don't want to marry Hitchcock's wife.
Here we come, Chickpea.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Easy!
Howdy there!
I'd really appreciate it kindly if y'all would stop punching my associate Reno, there.
Let me introduce myself. My name is Alamo.
This here's Tex, and this is...
Fred. Just Fred.
And we are... the Dallas Buyers Club.
Okay. We make a deal.
[speaks Serbian]
[chuckles] Sounds good.
No, I just told them to surround you.
Dagnabbit. Oof!
Look, Sarge, I'm sorry that we're in this mess, but on the bright side, we don't have to deal with some lame oboist.
You should be apologizing to Hitchcock and Scully.
You took them out of their house mouse comfort zone, and now they might get killed.
You really think they're going to kill us?
Oh, no, now I'm starting to panic sweat.
Starting to?
What have you been doing for the past hour?
Normal sweating.
Wait a minute.
If you get killed, what happens to all your debt?
Loophole!
Oh, you sweaty, chair-spinning morons.
You're gonna get us out of here.
Boyle, may I speak to you?
I don't know.
Are you still mad that I arrested John?
No.
I know he's guilty. I'm just chagrined.
Deeply chagrined.
I finally understand the old adage, ""Never meet your heroes.""
This is just like when I found out Robert Frost was from...
California.
Or when I saw Mario Batali with his hair down.
[shudders]
Well, you've handled this case with the utmost professionalism, while I've behaved crassly.
I think I've figured out a way to make it up to you.
Oh, my God, is Dianne Wiest here?
No, I've hired a trio of classical musicians to perform a Shostakovich cantata, originally written as an apology to a dear friend.
Are you stealing kitchen supplies?
Just let us have this stuff.
You have so much, and we have so little.
Perhaps I'll just buy you a drink instead.
Yeah, that would be best.
Classical musicians are savages.
They're not gonna kill you fast, Scully.
They're gonna make it real slow.
First they're gonna scalp you, and then they're gonna rip your tongue out!
No. That's my cupcake taster!
What are you doing? Lay off him!
Never! For my plan to work, he's gotta be basting in sweat.
Hitchcock, you once told me you could roll that chair anywhere.
Think you could take it up those stairs?
I once rode a chair home in a blizzard.
So, yeah, I can go up stairs.
So do it.
Oh, he's amazing.
He's like a big, lazy Michelle Kwan.
But how's he gonna get up the stairs?
Jake! He already did.
Okay, it's go time.
Help! My man's having a heart attack!
Help!
Hitchcock, now!
[grunts]
Scully! Grab his gun.
[roars]
It's not sticky because I'm so juicy!
Told you I knew what I was doing.
Black Fred, think quick.
No, no, ow! That was a gun, man!
Scully, grab that dude's knife and cut us loose.
We're gonna get the rest of these guys.
It's time for Operation Beans, phase two, the refrying.
Sure you're ready to go through with this?
You know what? Today was stupid.
But seeing you both overcome your fears did help me, and I think we've all grown as women.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Stab me! Stab me!
Do it, just do it!
Rosa?
I'm psyching myself up.
[yells]
Don't look at them! Look at me!
Do your job! Drain me!
[elevator bell dings]
There they are!
Everybody give it up for Hitchcock and Scully.
[applause]
To thank you for all you did, bringing down a drug ring, we have a little present for you: brand-new, top-of-the-line desk chairs, extra padding, with adjustable height and recline.
Hey, chair!
Get ready to meet your new best friend: my ass.
[both groaning happily]
That was very nice of you.
They did good.
Also, I was worried they might want to go out in the field more, and I need something to keep them at their desks.
You really think that that is going to keep them at their... and they're both asleep already.
And the city's safer for it.
Sleep tight, you magnificent oafs.
You deserve it.

03x17 - Adrian Pimento
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=25573,"





Hey Jake, can I show you something over here?
Sure thing, bud.
I'm trying to send Genevieve a sexy pic.
Does this make my bubble butt pop?
Nope. I'm out.
[whispers] Who's that?
[whispers] I don't know.
Um, excuse me, pal. Think you're at my desk.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Drop it! Drop the weapon!
Don't be a dum-dum.
Squad, meet Detective Adrian Pimento.
He's been deep undercover for the last 12 years, but he's just resurfaced, and he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.
That... is... awesome!
♪
Some of you just met Detective Pimento, and, of course, some of you knew him before he went undercover.
Hitchcock and Scully. Ha. You guys still work here?
The only way they're getting rid of us is in a body bag.
It actually happened once, but it was a false alarm.
Detective Pimento will be returning to his old desk.
Peralta will temporarily be moved to the break room.
Questions?
What'd you do undercover?
I worked for Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis.
That is an A-list mobster. Tell me literally everything.
Everyone, shut up!
Pretty much just a bagman for him.
I mean, I did some other stuff.
[grunting]
[crying]
Um, we usually try to tell funnier little stories.
Well, there's nothing funny about what I did for The Butcher.
I've had to learn not to blink, because every time I close my eyes, I see a fresh horror.
Ooh, dark.
But how do you keep your eyes moist?
Actually, I have a very funny story about keeping my eyes moist.
[grunting]
[laughs]
Come on... [laughing]
Nope.
Still not getting that vibe, man.
Really?
Mm-mm.
I'll get there. That's my bad, everybody.
Dismissed.
Sir, can I partner with Pimento on my B&E?
That guy is awesome.
He's like a real life Donnie Brasco.
Isn't Donnie Brasco a really sad movie that ends terribly?
Yeah, but he's got that cool jacket, and he's always down at the docks.
I'm not sure I want you working with Pimento.
He's a little unstable.
[banging]
Machine!
Psychologically, this could be a very difficult transition.
Yeah, I know, I went undercover.
63 days, no big deal. You probably forgot.
No, it's your outgoing voice mail message.
Hey, it's Jake.
Can't get to the phone right now.
I might be undercover again, like I was for 63 days.
Bye!
Look, I know what he's going through.
Let me be the man that brings him in from the cold.
All right, he can work the B&E with you.
Just make sure you take it easy.
Uh, sir, I was 20 minutes late for work today.
I don't think you need to tell me about taking it easy.
Are you bragging about being a bad employee?
No.
Dismissed? Me?
I figured out the best way to welcome Pimento to the Nine-Nine.
Stay out of his way, maybe buy him a drink, not do anything weird?
I'm making him a goat stew.
Huh... all right.
Yeah, now, this Turkmenistani dish is traditionally made from an animal that's been so overfed it can no longer stand.
[whistles] That's the dream.
Everything is authentic.
I even ordered the pressure cooker from Turkmenistan.
So you're on a terrorist watch list now?
Oh, yeah, Homeland Security's been in my house, yep.
Now, this just needs to cook for another 11 hours, 32 minutes, and 6...
[boom]
What the hell, Boyle! You almost killed me!
I'm not going out in a stew-making accident!
Terry's gonna die saving the President, or Terry's never gonna die!
There's no way we can clean this up by ourselves.
We're gonna need help.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you saying?
You know what she's saying, man.
Oh, no.
Mean Marge.
So we're supposed to come running to clean up your mess every time you snap your fat little fingers?
Oh, no, no, I actually can't snap my fingers, they're always too wet.
And I just thought, since it's your job...
Oh, I see.
You cops think you're too good to clean up after yourselves?
Uh... no, I can do it myself, I'll just...
That's union work!
How dare you try to steal our jobs.
So where do we go from here?
Well, you know the old saying, ""The only way to unclog a toilet is to let it sit.""
You're a janitor. You should know that's not true.
Boys, take out the trash.
Oh, great! So you will do it?
Oh! I'm the trash, I get it.
Okay, that makes more sense with your tone.
[metal chair skidding]
Oops! Oh...[laughs] Love you, Marge.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Yes, I have a special project for you.
Okay, but I'll have you know right now I only fly first class.
I'm not flying you anywhere.
I made an application to the M.C. Guffin Foundation for a grant to upgrade our office equipment.
Unfortunately, they require a video submission.
I understand you have some filmmaking experience.
Well, you know, I've been re-Vined by Rob Kardashian, so, yeah, I'm a director.
Here's what I'm picturing: I enter, in, like, a Fellini-style getup.
Rosa's dressed like a porcupine...
Oh, no, no. We're just gonna do a simple, straightforward tour of the precinct featuring Detective Diaz and me.
Are you sure?
You're not our most dynamic screen presences.
I can be dynamic.
Exclamation point.
Well, Diaz and I have that kind of easy chemistry where we finish each other's...
Sentences.
Please, don't interrupt me.
That kind of nonsense won't happen on camera.
Hey, hey, Pimento.
Hey!
This is my desk, okay?
Okay, well, now that that's out of the way, I was just coming to let you know we're gonna work a B&E together; we're gonna be partners.
Nope. I work alone.
Plus, The Butcher says he has spies in the NYPD, so I trust none of these dildos.
Listen, you can trust me.
I'm, like, obsessed with you.
[scoffs] Fine.
Tell me something you've never told another living soul.
Um...
Ooh, here's one.
I'm actually not strong enough to lift a water cooler jug, so I always find a way to make Terry do it.
Here's mine.
Jimmy ""The Butcher"" made me drive a croquet wicket through a guy's eyes into his brain.
Brain leaked out his eyes like he was crying his own mind.
My goodness.
Now that I've heard yours, I feel like my water cooler thing could have been a little more juicy, but...
No. That was embarrassing for you.
A bond has been made.
Feels good to trust again, brother.
Wow, either you are a cyborg or you're carrying so many weapons in this jacket.
Hey. Kitchen, now.
Okay.
What's up?
Something's not right about that guy.
Why, just because he keeps threatening to kill me in the middle of a police precinct? Uh, grow up.
Because I'm physically attracted to him.
And that's bad?
I'm only attracted to creeps: the Vulture, the ShamWow guy, and when I was a kid, I had a major crush on the evil Gremlin.
Stripe? Are you crazy?
Yeah, well I'm not gonna bone Gizmo.
I would.
Careful with Pimento.
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, partner.
Oh!
I've been waiting for you.
[chuckles]
Sorry if I surprised you.
It's just when I was undercover, the middle of the night was the only time I could do actual police work.
Uh, how'd you get in the apartment?
Oh, it was easy.
I just seduced the old lady upstairs, came down the fire escape, jimmied the window open.
Bing-bang-boom, I'm inside your living quarters.
Totally.
Course, next time you could just give me a call, you know.
Two ways to pop in on a friend.
I didn't kill the old lady upstairs, if that's what you're worried about.
Well, I am now.
Oh, wait a minute.
You think I'm being weird.
Oh, I shouldn't have come here. This is your apartment.
I'm so sorry, Jake! Stupid, Paul!
Stupid! You idiot, Paul!
Hey! Pimento!
Huh?!
Who's Paul?
Whoa.
Paul Sneed was my undercover name.
'Kay? Damn it, Jake.
I don't know who I am anymore.
You could have chose any name to go undercover, and you picked Paul Sneed?
Seems kind of crazy.
I shouldn't have come here.
This was a mistake. I'm not ready.
I knew I wasn't ready to go back to being police.
It's the only job I've ever had except for bagging groceries at the supermarket at the corner of Atlantic and Clinton.
I guess I could go back to that again.
""Paper or plastic?""
Yeah, still got it.
Listen to me, I was undercover.
63 days with the Mafia. I saw some messed-up stuff.
I know what your struggle is.
And I can bring you home, but you've got to trust me.
Okay. Yeah.
Great. Now, I've got to get some sleep.
You're welcome to stay here and work the case if you want.
Thanks, partner.
I promise I won't disturb you at all.
Whuuuhhhh.
Whuuuhhhh.
Hey, Pimento.
Huh?
I thought you were just gonna be looking through the files or something, man.
Sorry, brother.
Tai chi helps keep the demons at bay.
Right.
And...
Do you have to do it in your underwear?
I can't take them off, 'cause then you'd be looking right at my pen1s and testicles.
Can't argue with that logic. Mm-kay.
Why is there so much garbage in here?
[sighs] Mean Marge won't clean up the stew.
And also, she suspended our trash service.
What happened?
You didn't grovel enough, did you?
Seriously, Amy, you're gonna ask Charles Boyle if he groveled enough? Come on!
This is the grossest thing I've ever seen, and I have three kids under the age of four.
I live in a house of fluids.
Look, I have a plan, okay?
We're just gonna go over Mean Marge's head and we're gonna tell Holt.
Tell me what?
Oh, well, I don't know if you noticed, but there was an accident in the break room yesterday.
Oh, yes, shattered windows, bones everywhere.
It's very ""New York in the 70s."" Clean it up.
The, uh, problem... is Marge in facilities is refusing to help.
We were actually hoping maybe you could ask her.
Excuse me?
I'm the captain of this precinct.
I don't have time to mediate your petty squabbles.
I've taken a sacred oath to protect this community, and that is a job I take seriously.
So you're afraid of her, too, huh?
Terrified.



Yeah, perp knew where the camera was.
Must have cased the joint ahead of time.
We're gonna need all your footage from the past week.
Ha-ha-ha. This is an amateur job.
Everybody knows you break in when the owner's there.
That way you have guaranteed access to the safe, and you can kick his teeth in to send a message.
Okay, why don't you just...
Oh, sure, you could slit his throat, but then what are you going to do with all the blood?
Uh, we'd leave it in his body, where blood lives, because we're cops.
Oh, right, we're cops. And don't worry, sir.
We're gonna catch these bastards, or my name isn't Paul Sneed.
Adrian Pimento.
Adrian Pimento. So, what'd they take?
About $15,000 worth of stuff.
TVs, cameras, bunch of pre-paid cell phones.
Ooh, you sell burner phones?
What kind of deals you got on those?
Why do you want to know about the deals?
Just gathering evidence for the case, 'cause I'm a cop, remember?
Detective Paul Sneed.
Adrian Pimento.
Adrian Piment... I... I know who I am... you know what... forget this!
Ah... okay.
[grunting]
Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.
Look, I get it... you're still tense.
When I came back from being undercover, they made me see a shrink.
But then he told me I had dad issues, and I was like, ""You know what, you can't tell me what to do, you're not my dad,"" so he was a moron.
No, you know what, that's good advice... thanks, man, thanks.
I... I'll be right back, I just left something inside.
Hey, give me one of those.
Why are you buying a burner phone?
Cue smoke machine.
And... action Holt.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.
I don't understand why I'm on a wheelchair.
Cut!
For the last time, Rosa, through the magic of special effects, the wheelchair will turn into a horse, but I need you to work with me.
Give me a little ""hee-yah!""
Hee-yah!
This is idiotic.
Maybe because you didn't karate chop your way through the smoke, as scripted.
I'm out. Scully.
Rosa!
Hee-yah, hee-yah.
I wanted a simple, straightforward video tour of the precinct, and you've added the one ingredient I didn't want: pizzazz.
Pizzazz is who I am.
Would you tell the sky to stop being so blue?
Yes. I wish it were tan.
What?
It's my favorite color. It's no-nonsense.
Hey, I've been tailing Pimento, and I think you were right.
There's something weird going on with that guy.
I knew it. Ugh!
I can't believe I'm gonna sleep with him.
Well, you don't have to.
No, I'm gonna.
He secretly bought a burner phone, he broke into my apartment and he keeps forgetting he's a cop and calling himself by his alias, Paul Sneed.
Paul Sneed?
He said Figgis has spies in the NYPD.
Rosa, what if he's one of them? What if he turned?
Oh, here he comes.
Oh, man, bolt cutters?
Bolt cutters have literally never been used by an innocent person.
I use them all the time when I make jewelry.
What? Oh, my God.
Follow-up questions later.
All right, I got to keep following him.
All right, but be careful.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be invisible.
Now you see me, now you...
[car engine revs]
♪ 'Cause here's my number Ah...
♪ So call me maybe
[music stops]
We're cool, we're cool.
Everything's still cool. He didn't hear me, we're cool.
[phone pad beeps]
Rosa.
Pimento just put on a ski mask and broke into a creepy abandoned warehouse.
Mm, that's hot.
It is?
Oh, wait, he's coming back out.
Did he do something super shady?
Are his eyes all wild?
Rosa, focus.
Sorry.
Send a pic. Bye.
Okay, guess we're done talking.
Well, they still haven't cleaned up in there, but the good news is I got a new plan.
I let one of the perps accidentally get out of holding, then I take him down to the break room.
Oopsie. Now it's a whole crime scene.
[gasps] And then we can get crime scene cleaners.
Boom.
Not so fast.
That room gets clean when I say it gets cleaned.
You can't stop us now.
You ever heard the old saying, ""Know the garbage, know the man?""
That's not a saying.
Yes, it is. I know all your secrets.
[snaps fingers] Boyle.
You got a taste for fast food.
[giggles] Those aren't mine.
I only eat locally-sourced meats.
They could be Terry's. He was fat once, you know?
What the hell, Boyle?
Speaking of Jeffords, maybe your daughters would like to know that their daddy throws away all their drawings?
They just draw so many, and they're all so bad.
And you, Santiago, maybe the world would like to see that draft of a memo you wrote where you used T-H-E-I-R instead of T-H-E-R-E?
Oh, you sick son of a bitch.
Why do you hate us so much?
I know you call me Mean Marge.
Do you even know my last name?
Hmm?
Mop-Bucket?
Scully, don't guess.
Please.
No.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
""Mop-Bucket,"" Scully?
It was a educated guess.
Thanks for coming.
Pimento put the duffel in his trunk, parked around the corner, and went home; he's been doing shirtless tai chi in his window ever since.
Which window is that?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Look, I got to get into that trunk.
And you need me to break into the car for you?
What? No, I can do it.
Why would you say that?
Because one time you lost your keys and you called a tow truck.
My mom pays for roadside assistance.
Why wouldn't I call it? I'm doing this.
Okay, great take! You guys are finally getting it.
All right, let's go again. Action Holt!
[rhythmic blowing]
Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz. Hee-yah.
The hell is this?
You had a pizzazz problem, so you've been recast, sweetie.
Welcome to Hollywood.
You know, David here really connected with the role.
The key is to invent a backstory for your character.
Now, my Raymond Holt is addicted to pills, but no one knows.
You see, he really understands the craft, whereas you and Rosa just sort of flop around like a couple of boring normals.
I'm sorry, but we're detectives, not professional actors.
We were trying our hardest.
""We were trying our hardest.""
Stop it.
Gina, this is a disgrace. I'm removing you as director.
There he goes.
[whispering] Off to take more pills.
Oh, yeah.
Suck it, roadside assistance.
Well, well, well.
Hello, Jake.
Adrian, what a coincidence bumping into you here.
Well, see you tomorrow.
[gun cocks]
You know what, let's hang out now.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
[laughs]
What are you doing here, partner?
Pimento's still in the windo.
Come on, Jake.
You honestly didn't assume I would hire a look-alike to wear a fake beard and do tai chi in my window?
No, I definitely didn't assume that.
And plus, you seriously thought that was me?
I mean, you've seen me in my underpants.
My butt is rock hard.
That guy's got a pancake butt.
I can't believe you're still working for Figgis.
That's why you've been acting so weird.
Breaking into my apartment, buying a burner phone, grabbing this duffel.
I broke into your apartment 'cause I didn't feel safe at my home.
Okay.
And a burner phone is the only kind of phone I can get because I disappeared for 12 years, and now have terrible credit.
Makes sense.
You want to know what's in the duffel?
Open it up, tough guy.
[sighs]
Oh, look at that.
A bunch of old family photos and personal belongings.
Pimento's mementos.
I know you have a gun on me.
I just couldn't resist the rhyme, sorry.
I stashed it all when I became Paul Sneed.
I couldn't have them finding anything that could trace back to my family.
I get it, all right?
I went through the exact same thing when I came back...
You have no clue what I've been through!
You know what?
I can't believe I trusted you.
Okay.
Just get out of here, Jake.
Oh, my God, this guy's got a pancake butt.
It's not Pimento. Get out of there, Jake!
Thanks, Rosa.
So Detective Pimento didn't show up for work today.
Any idea why?
Oh, yeah, I straight up drove him off.
Big screw-up on my part.
I'm trying this new thing where I just own my mistakes.
I like it. Do you?
I did.
Until you bragged about it.
Yeah.
Pimento left his gun and badge on my desk, along with a note reading, ""I can't do this. I'm better off as a bagman.""
Oh, no.
You think he went back to work with Figgis?
Worse.
Fine, single bag it.
It's your funeral, you dumb son of a bitch.
Get out of here.
Idiot.
Hey, partner.
Bag boys don't have partners.
Actually, cashiers and bag boys need to be totally in sync...
Shut up, Maggie.
Look, man, you sacrificed 12 years of your life for the police department; you're a hero.
I'm sorry that I didn't trust you.
Yeah. Me too.
Look, can I tell you something I've never told anyone before?
My time undercover in the Mafia was actually kind of lame.
I mean, I wanted it to be badass, but I'm good at computers, so I mostly just helped them switch over from AOL.
I have no idea what you're going through.
And I want to tell you that it's all gonna go back to normal, but honestly, I have no clue.
Anyways, the footage came back on that B&E, and we've got a suspect.
I'm going to bust him right now if you want to come with me.
Why don't you give me those eggs?
I'll put them on top here.
Okay.
What was that about? What happened to you?
Maggie, butt out!
Okay? This is my life!
So I just received word from our friend at the Guffin Foundation.
Apparently they loved our video submission.
What did you send them?
A cinematic masterpiece is what I sent them.
Did it feature pizzazz?
No, none at all, sir.
First, I couldn't wrap my head around that concept, but then I realized: do you know which dogs get the most likes on the internet?
Anatolian Shepherds.
No, ugly little runts with wonky eyes and tongues that won't stay in their mouths.
But the Anatolian Shepherd is unrivaled for protecting livestock.
I was trying to wow them, and I should have just been showcasing our wonk-eye.
♪ I will remember you We were trying our hardest, but this is a disgrace.
[echoing] Disgrace, disgrace.
Help us. Stop it.
And that's real audio of your very-real diva meltdown.
You might just make it as an actor after all.
Well done, Linetti.
Sergeant Linetti.
I had the fake Holt give me a promotion.
He signed the papers and everything.
What do you want?
To tell you that we will officially be renaming the fourth-floor break room ""The Marge Bronigan Break Room.""
Well.
Looks like somebody did their homework.
It was me. I did it.
So what's the catch?
The ceremony starts in two hours.
Now, I know our squad is not in the janitor's union, but it'd sure be nice if we were allowed to clean the place up before then.
We cleaned up the stew, which means the Marge Bronigan Break Room is open for business!
Okay, we'll take out your trash, do normal cleaning, but no big messes.
Great! Time for the christening.
[pop] [glass shatters]
[overlapping chatter, commotion]
Oh, crap.
[all gasp, shout]
Congratulations.
Perp is on the third floor. Everyone know your assignment?
Mind if I tag along?
Pimento?
I thought about it.
If you say things will get back to normal, then I trust you.
All right.
Let's do this.
You're with me, partner.

NYPD! You're under arrest!
You're gonna die!

Attention, everyone!
Say good-bye to the Jake Peralta you know and love, for today is the day I forever change.
Ooh, are you finally growing a mustache?
No, you know I can't do that, and it's cruel of you to keep bringing it up.
This envelope contains the inheritance my uncle left me.
He died a year ago; he was so rich, he had a whole room in his house just to eat in.
You mean like a dining room?
Yeah, but in Manhattan.
Oh, dang.
Now, just because I'm definitely rich now doesn't mean I'm gonna forget my roots.
You all get something, so fire away.
Jake, your friendship is gift enough for me.
Friendship is crap. I want a Ducati Monster 821.
All right, Rosa gets a motorcycle.
Oh, cool. I want a fast sports car.
Come on. You can be honest.
I want old, expensive books. I'll send you a list.
There you go.
Now, let's find out what I'm worth.
Oh, I'm too nervous to open it. Sarge, you do it.
Okay.
It's stock. One million shares!
Oh, my God!
Of Blockbuster Video stock.
All: Ohh.
What? Is that bad?
I still have a Blockbuster card!
What happened to Blockbuster?

Mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping.
What's going on there, buddy?
Just making a final imprint of your face before the LASIK surgery goes poorly and my eyeballs get burned off.
Why stop at the eyes? Burn off your whole head.
Charles, the surgery is going to go fine, all right?
You'll have some vision impairment for a few hours, and I'm gonna be with you the whole time!
Plus, they're gonna give you some of those sweet-ass Robocop sunglasses.
Those are blind people sunglasses.
Captain. What are you doing here?
Thought you took the day off to pack for your big trip, or did you finally realize that it only takes one minute to pack?
Not if you care about your possessions and what the world sees when they look at you.
Huh.
I'm not going.
Cheddar's regular dog sitter is ill, and the heat's out in my house, so I don't think it's a good time for me to visit Kevin in Paris.
Sir, you can't just cancel your trip.
You guys haven't seen each other in months.
How about this: Amy and I will look after your house while you're gone.
Right, Ames?
Totally.
I thought you two were watching Ray Charles Boyle.
Good point.
Charles can come with us and look after Cheddar.
I'm told that blind people have a special connection with dogs.
I knew it. You do think I'm gonna go blind.
That's an interesting offer, but I don't want to be an imposition.
Pshaw! Imposition? Pshaw!
No, I was talking to Santiago.
I assume she'll be doing all the work.
Why?
Oh, because of our track records and personalities.
Sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah.
So, Santiago, are you sure you're okay with this?
I'm so in. This is gonna be fantastic.
This is horrible! We're not ready for this.
This is a level one responsibility.
I'm a level two at best, and you're not even a level!
Well, I'm a level, you know.
I'm probably, like, a level five.
Not a level.
I thought you'd be psyched.
I mean, a week at Captain Holt's house?
Wasn't that where you wanted to spend your honeymoon?
Yeah, but this is too much pressure!
Why did you volunteer us for this?
Because Holt hasn't seen Kevin in, like, months, and I was just thinking if that was me and you, it would make me really sad.
Oh. That's actually super sweet.
Plus, therthis big, fat binder full of instructions and rules.
There's a binder?
Why didn't you lead with that, you idiot?
Oh!
How about I just leave you two alone?
Okay.
Diaz.
Pimento.
What's up?
What's up with you?
I need you to sign this report.
Okay.
I'll sign your report.
Mm.
What the hell?
Mm.
Careful. The ink's still wet.
Maybe this'll help.
Okay, they got to knock that off.
Loosen up, Sarge.
Summer of love, baby.
It's March, man. Shut up.
It's true what they say.
Now that I'm fully blind forever, my other senses are heightened.
I feel a door. [gasps]
We're at Captain Holt's house.
Also, the GPS announced it when we pulled up.
Hey, once we're inside, maybe keep your hands to yourself, all right?
The captain can be very particular about his stuff.
Cheddar! Let go! Let go of it!
Amy?
This is a cashmere sweater!
[sneezes] Oh, my stupid allergies!
He got into Kevin's closet.
He was supposed to stay downstairs.
The binder was very clear about that.
Why won't you respect the binder?
Oh, no, he's turning all the turtlenecks into regular necks.
Charles, you got to help us.
On it.
Okay, the key with dogs is establishing the alpha.
Cheddah, dwop it. Pwease dwop it.
I'll give you anything you want.
Oh, Cheddar is the alpha. Didn't expect that.
Pwease, pwease, pwease.
[sighs]
Nice job, Boyle. It worked.
But the mess, Jake. The mess!
Don't worry. We're gonna clean it up.
Everything is totally under control.
Charles' pants are on fire.
What?
Boyle, the space heater! Get away from the space heater!
I don't know where it is!
[smoke alarm beeping]
I'm just gonna run at full speed!
No!
Aah!
Charles, just stay where you are!
I got it.
[grunting]
Whoo! Okay.
It's okay. Everything's fine.
Fire's out. And this table is...
Oh!
Fragile. I was gonna say fragile.
Nailed it.
Ah!
You punching holes?
Yeah.
That's way too much paper.
Not for me.
Can't even get a cup of coffee.
[grunts]
Well, I'm off to find some yellow paper so I can do this all over again.
All right, Diaz? That's it.
What's going on with you two?
Oh, you noticed it?
Yeah, I noticed it!
Everyone's noticed it!
A convicted pervert asked me if you guys could cool it.
I don't know what to tell you.
Something between us, Sarge.
Something dark and urgent.
Ah.
Okay. Great news.
The smell of burnt sweatpants and singed leg hair is finally dissipating.
I just hope I can grow it back by Speedo season.
[phone rings]
Call from Raymond Holt, mobile.
Oh, no. Not Holt.
Don't worry. I've got this.
Bonjour, Captain. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
No, I don't want to sleep with you.
Is that what that means?
Oh, man, I had a really gross tennis instructor.
I'm calling to check in before I get on the flight.
Everything okay?
[scoffs] Okay?
Let's just say if the house could talk, she would say, ""I've never been happier; I love Jake.""
Oh, that's interesting, because I think the house might say ""Jake's a liar, and I'm... on fire.""
What's that now?
The security company called me about the alarm.
Okay, the house was never on fire.
Charles was on fire, and only on his pants, and we put it out.
I'm coming home right now.
Wait, no. Sir, please don't do that.
You have to go see Kevin. Everything's fine.
No, my decision is final. I'm postponing my flight.
Good-bye, Jacob.
No, sir! Please, please... ahh!
He said ""Jacob.""
It's biblical.
Guys, guys!
Holt is headed home right now.
No! He can't come home.
We left the door open, and the dog ran out.
What? We lost Cheddar?
These silences are very hard for me to read.
What's the vibe in here?
We're freaking out, Charles!
Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining me.
What we have here is a fugitive situation.
Our man has been on the run for 30 minutes.
Also, our man is a dog.
Now, I know what some of you are thinking: ""Who cares? It's just a pet.""
No one was thinking that, you monster.
Good. That was a test.
Now, the average foot speed of a corgi is ten miles per hour, which means with every passing second, that slippery b*st*rd gets farther away.
[mellow music]
Captain Holt does not know Cheddar is missing... but he's gonna find out.
Oh, God, I feel like the devil is dancing on my chest.
It's all right, Amy. We have time.
Gina's picking Holt up at the airport, and she told me she can stall him for at least two hours.
I'll do it, but I'm gonna have to total your car.
Or you could just drive slowly.
Ha-ha, she's gonna wreck your car.
Here's where we're at.
Amy and I will take Blind Charles and search the neighborhood.
Diaz, Pimento...
Bring the dog back, dead or alive.
What? No. I was gonna say hang posters.
Terry, maybe go with them, make sure nobody gets killed.
Or maybe I could join another group with a different kind of energy?
Jake, what about me and Hitchcock?
You two grab Cheddar's treats and put 'em in a bowl outside.
You mean the little sausage ones that need way more salt?
On second thought, maybe just sit exactly where you are and don't touch anything.
Sweet.
All right, everyone, it's time to do this.
For Captain Holt, for Kevin, for America!
Let's go, Nine-Nine!
[groans]
This line is interminable.
At this rate, we'll be home in 54 minutes instead of the usual 46.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Watch me now!
[tires squealing]
No, Gina, the wrong way.
No, Gina, the spikes!
Uh-oh.
Well, not a problem.
I can get you home on two wheels.
[tires pop]
And that was the second pair of tires.
Mm.
I could've done that.
Yeah, I know you could've.
But you didn't. I did.
I mean, there are lots of other poles, guys.
A whole street full of 'em.
So, Adrian, when are we gonna stop messing around and do this thing?
Um...
N-never.
What?
You know what? I just realized.
I forgot something at home. I'm just gonna...
That was weird. You okay?
Yes.
[grunting]
All right, according to the call we just got on the tip line, someone said they saw Cheddar on this block.
I'll head north. Jake, you head west.
We'll meet back in a half hour.
Great, which direction should I go?
[both mouthing words]
What's going on? I can hear your lips moving.
Ah! Are you guys kissing?
What? No.
Charles, stop always asking that.
Look, I'm sorry, but you have to stay in the car.
That's a mistake!
My super senses are a tool you can't afford to leave in the tool chest.
Take me out of the box and put me on your belt.
I'm sorry, but you'd only slow us down.
And that's exactly what Cheddar wants.
That's right.
I'm onto you, you slippery little b*st*rd.



[mellow music]
Gina, come on.
You can do your Internet socializing in the truck.
Okay, cool, I just have to tie my shoe real quick.
Tying it.
Call Jake Peralta.
Gina, hey, how's the stalling?
Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.
Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?
Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.
You did. You did.
All right, well, we're about to go follow up on a lead right now.
Great; I'm gonna rip a bunch of wires out of your dashboard.
What? No, don't! Gina...
Gah!
I got nothing. Did you find Cheddar?
Close. I found Shredder.
Shredder, no! No, Shredder!
You're not Cheddar!
I know it looks bad, but we're gonna find him.
Right after we find Charles.
Charles is gone. We lost Charles.
What?
Charles? Charles!
[toy squeaks] Here, boy!
[toy squeaks] Here, boy!
Oh, I should've known I was gonna lose Charles.
He's so pocket-sized. He could be hidden anywhere!
Jake, we need to focus on Cheddar.
Charles is a grown man. He can take care of himself.
No, he's not. He's a Charles, all right?
And he's blind!
Oh, God, he's probably already dead.
Right? So let's not waste any resources on him.
[cell phone rings]
Wait, it's Charles.
Charles?
Jake? Is that you?
I can't see my phone.
I've dialed over 40 wrong numbers.
It's me.
I found Cheddar.
He found Cheddar!
Which is why I was like, ""We need to go to him.""
Charles, where are you?
I've got him cornered in some bushes, but I don't know where I am, and my...
[train horn blows]
Wait, stop talking.
I'm hearing something in the background.
What is that, a train and a girl whimpering?
That's me; I'm so scared you're not gonna find me.
Charles, don't move. I know exactly where you are.
He's at the entrance by 7th Street.
I used to hang out there all the time.
Doing what?
Aw! I boofed it.
Nothing. Cool stuff. Having s*x.
Anyways, it doesn't matter. Let's go.
Aah!
Hey, Sarge.
I've been waiting for you.
In here?
Yeah, I wanted to have a private conversation.
Do you think Diaz noticed that I freaked out a little when she asked me out?
You mean the way your eyes popped out of your head and you sprinted away at full speed?
Yeah, I think she noticed.
Damn it.
I'm in kind of a weird head space right now.
I've got a lot on my plate, emotionally speaking.
And flirting's one thing, but a relationship?
Well...
The last time I let myself fall for someone was Katya.
She was a bartender at the Garbage Box, second-rate strip club my mob buddies and I used to go to.
She was a sweet girl, but I couldn't save her from the pole.
Oh, she started stripping?
Nope.
Boss impaled her on a pole when he caught her skimming tips.
Ooh! Damn, dude.
Look, coming back from 12 years undercover is not easy for anyone.
I'm sure Diaz gets it.
She's so in touch with her feelings.
And me, hmm.
After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.
Of course you do.
Huh.
I never looked at it that way.
Wow. That changes everything.
[chuckles]
Ha!
I never even finished my point.
No, Sarge, you said it all.
You just changed my life.
He's got to be here somewhere.
What's up, Peralta?
Want to jump in on this tasty sesh?
Uh, you got the wrong guy. I've never seen you before.
Heh, dumb stoner.
He referred to you by name.
Hey, there's Charles.
Jake? Jake?
Charles, we're behind you.
Look! I found Cheddar.
I found him.
Oh, God.
I know. Pretty impressive, right?
It's a proud day for blind people everywhere.
Charles...
It wasn't easy, though.
This guy put up quite a fight.
But we're good friends now, right?
Right? You gave me a bunch of kisses.
You gave me a bunch of kisses.
Damn it, Charles, it's a possum.
Oh, no.
Mercifully, the tires have been replaced, so may I please have the keys?
Okay, but before we go, can we just choose a nice air freshener from the gift shop?
You never know when you're gonna find your signature scent.
I'm not an idiot, Gina; I know for a fact you've already found your signature scent.
Ugh! I have got to stop living my life out loud.
I've had a hell of a day.
I've got a lot going on in my life, more than Peralta ruining my house, so can we please drop the charade so I can get home already?
Absolutely, sir.
Wait, I should tell you.
Before you got real with me...
I did rip out all these wires.
All right, everyone, listen up.
Here's where we're at.
Bad news: Cheddar is still at large, and you know that slippery little b*st*rd is just laughing at us.
[mellow music]
We need a new plan, and we need it now.
Because the walls are closing in and I can't breathe.
Come on, guys, we're just spitballing.
There's no stupid ideas.
What if we walk around the neighborhood in Captain Holt's clothes, wait till Cheddar picks up the smell?
No, that's insane, never gonna happen.
Anyone else?
You guys go off the grid.
I'm listening. Go on.
I get you guys Mexican passports.
Totally untraceable.
We fake your death in an apartment fire.
I'll need three teeth from both of you.
Then you guys just disappear.
It's easy. I've done it before.
Oh, have you?
Because you haven't mentioned it 500 times.
Get a new thing.
Okay.
Amazingly, wearing Holt's clothes is our best option.
Everyone, prepare to enter high society.
[regal classical music]
♪ ♪
Okay, how's everybody feeling?
Anyone else have the weird urge to lecture themselves?
""Peralta, what are you doing?""
Peralta, what are you doing?
I conjured him.
Captain Holt! What a pleasant surprise.
Gina told me that you were delayed due to a wire situation.
Yes, the situation is, you can rip them all out but the car still works.
Sorry, boo.
Wait, why is the whole squad here?
And why is everyone wearing my clothes?
My God.
You lost Cheddar.
How did you do that?
Sir, I know you're upset, but I promise you we can find Cheddar and you can still go to Paris.
I'm not going to Paris.
Now, get out of my clothes.
Get into your clothes.
Get out of my house.
Get into your cars...
All right, we can take it from there.
Loud and clear. Once again, so sorry.
[sighs]
Oh, he's so disappointed.
Look, I'm sorry that I got you involved in this.
I never should have volunteered us.
No, Jake. It's not your fault.
It's Amy's.
What?
Well, it's not my fault.
Blind.
Ugh.
And Jake's not the one who let Cheddar go to town on Kevin's sweaters.
Please, it's not like I fed him Kevin's sweaters.
Wait a minute, guys. I think this is Kevin's fault.
No, Jake, it's Amy's.
I know you're trying to be a cool boyfriend... yet another reason why it's not your fault... but Kevin's in Paris.
Exactly, and that's why I think it's Kevin's fault.
I have an idea of how to find Cheddar.
Amy, don't act weird when I say this, but we're gonna need to use the binder.
Oh, Mama.
Diaz!
Could we talk?
What do you want, Pimento?
Listen, Sarge gave me some really great advice.
So, Rosa Diaz, will you marry me?
Both: What?
This is what you told me to do!
I barely said anything!
You cut me off way too early.
Sarge, stay out of this.
Gladly.
No, I will not marry you.
How about we just get a drink first?
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds nice.
Oh, that's actually sweet.
Nope.
Oh, there he is.
Captain Holt! Oh, he can't hear me.
[car alarm blaring]
Eh...
[car alarm blares]
Okay, well, I guess we know what those wires did.
I'm not in the mood for your antics, Peralta.
Sir, sir!
I think we know where Cheddar is.
Will you please just get in the car?
[sighs]
Oh, let me get that.
Try now.
Oh, I can't control the locks.
Hang on. Try now. One, two, three.
Try now. Try now. Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now. Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now. Try now.
Try now. Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now.
Cheddar!
Come here, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
How did you know he was here?
Well, Cheddar was only chewing up Kevin's stuff.
I figured maybe he was acting out because he missed Kevin.
But the real hero here is the binder.
Under ""Cheddar,"" subsection ""Walk,"" subsection ""Walks with Kevin,"" we found this special spot.
So you're missing Kevin, huh?
You're not the only one.
[sighs]
I didn't cancel my trip because I was worried you would burn my house down.
Kevin and I are having a hard time right now.
Whenever we talk, we fight.
And I'm just afraid and just... just afraid that if I go to Paris and we fight, then...
Sir, with all due respect, that's crazy.
I mean, you and Kevin are the best couple I know.
And I'm sure whatever this is, you can get through it, because you are the strongest person I know.
Wow, that was weird; I said, like, multiple real things consecutively, yeah.
Felt weird but good. Are you proud of me?
You're ruining it.
Yup.
I'm just gonna stop talking now.
Well, I suppose I'm not gonna solve anything by running away from it.
Perhaps I should go to Paris.
What do you think, Cheddar? Huh?
Oh, my, oh! You really are acting out!
Whew! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Oh.
You know, it's moments like these that I'm grateful for your...

Bonjour, mes amis.
Oh, someone had a good time in Paris.
Oh, Kevin and I shared a perfect week together.
I feel like I'm floating on a croissant.
I wonder why people don't just break into song more often.
I've been asking you for months if I could answer the phone like, ♪ Who dis? ♪
Give it a whirl, girl.
Guys, he's rhyming.
He's telling Gina to sing.
Captain Holt is on a vacation high!
He will say yes to anything right now.
I would like a police horse, and I'd like Terry to be riding it almost constantly.
I'd like an HR person to remind everyone about workplace boundaries.
The Japanese make toilet seats which squirt a heated jet of water right up your...
I'm gonna stop you right there, bud.
What we need in here is an armored personnel carrier... a tank!
Two tanks. I want a tank too.
Great, so everyone gets a tank.
Just remember we can't ruin Captain Holt's vacation high, so no one say anything that'll upset him.
Oh, no, what are those morons doing in there?
Maybe it's not that bad; maybe they didn't upset him.
What'd you do? What'd you say?
Nothing. We just said, ""Welcome back.""
And laughed with him about all the weight he gained in France.
[chuckling]
No!
Why is everyone just standing around?
Get back to work!
So long, tank.
Tank?
I gained three pounds in Paris... three pounds!

Hey, Terry, I have a package for you.
[grunting]
Ooh, Sarge got a present.
""What's in the box?""
Brad Pitt, ""Se7en.""
But seriously, what's in the box?
The worst thing in the world.
[kitten mews] Shut up, stupid.
Okay, so who sent you a kitten and why do you hate it?
It's not a kitten.
It's a slap in the face for something that happened 20 years ago.
When you had a flat top?
I know you had a flat top, 'cause I saw pictures.
Sorry, go on with your story, Flat Top Terry.
It was 1995.
I'd just made detective.
I was really excited about my first day at the 6-5, but the guys in the squad were a bunch of jerks.
Hi, I'm Terry.
Which desk is mine?
Solve a case, then you get a desk.
They were like that about a lot of stuff.
Whoa, solve a case, then you get coffee.
Solve a case, then you can sign Debbie's birthday card.
Sounds like you needed to solve a case.
Exactly, so I picked the biggest one I could find: a string of B&Es, all with the same M.O.
Guy climbed in through high-rise windows.
After a month, I found my suspect: Dmitri Kuzkho.
Ex-acrobat with a criminal record.
Circus trash! It has to be him.
That's exactly what I said.
Circus trash! It has to be him.
I tracked down my acrobat, got SWAT to surround his building.
There was no way anything could go wrong.
NYPD! Down!
Get on the ground!
Let's see your hands!
Uh-oh.
My guy had a terrible trapeze fall two years prior... snapped his spine in half.
So why the kitten?
Well, in the moment, I may have gotten a little flustered.
Look, he's got a cat!
He trained the cat to do the robberies!
That's why they call them cat burglars!
Why is no one saying anything?
[laughter]
Oh, Terry.
Yeah, now they send me cats to remind me of that day and rub it in my face.
I'm gonna go put a ad online so I can find someone to adopt this evil, little turd.
Counterpoint: you two make an adorable couple.
Might I suggest putting him in a mug and pretending to take a sip?
Terry, are you stomping off to do my thing?
Oh, hey, can I borrow that?
Genevieve's out of town.
I need two phones so I can send her a ""frontie"" and a ""backie.""
I don't want your ass in my cloud.

[razor buzzing]
Adrian, are you living in the break room?
No, why do you ask?
Uh, because you're shaving your shoulder in our communal eating space; you have a bed set up on the couch; stuff like that.
Fine. Busted.
My landlord kicked me out because my stupid neighbors couldn't handle a few tiny night screams.
[shrieking]
I was dreaming that someone was trying to scalp me with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.
Aren't brains fascinating?
I mean, where does it come up with this stuff?
When I was undercover, someone did try and scalp me with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.
Sure, that would do it.
Aren't you dating Rosa?
Can't you just stay with her?
Oh, yeah, no, we're doing this really hot thing where we haven't told each other where we live.
Makes our s*x play really erotic.
Barf.
I totally get that.
Well, you let me know if there's anything I can do.
Oh, yes, I will stay at your home.
Thank you.
Me? What... how now?
You just said you wanted to help.
Oh, unless you weren't being serious, which I would get.
I've been betrayed before.
For instance, by the grapefruit spoon guy.
No, no, no, no, definitely.
You could stay with me.
Oh! You're the best, Chuck!
Thank you!
But for real, get yourself some good ear plugs, because I really downplayed how horrible those night screams are.
Ah.
All right, I'll see you later, roomie.
All right.
Attention: the 9-9 will be hosting a bomb-defusing class tomorrow.
I highly recommend attending.
Defusing an explosive device is the ultimate test of skill under pressure.
And the stakes: life or death.
Will lunch be provided?
Yes.
Count us in.
Anyone else?
I'm in.
Me too.
This class sounds like ""da bomb.""
I'd rather you didn't attend if you're not gonna take it seriously.
Yup.
Dismissed.
I'm gonna dominate that class.
You don't cross-stitch for 20 years without developing a steady hand.
Wow, you really think that's a brag, don't you?
20 bucks says I do better in that class than you do, thread-head.
All right, you're on.
And I'll have you know that ""thread-head"" is a glowing compliment in the sewing community.
If you wanted to insult me, you should've called me a stitch skipper.
Okay, stitch skipper.
Oh, I handed it to you!

You better look cute in this picture, or no one's gonna want you.
Do something with your damn paws!
Whoa, whoa, Sarge, relax.
Look, I think you might be overreacting a little to this prank, and I should know.
You probably won't believe this, but I was bullied in high school for being too handsome.
I don't believe you.
You're right.
It was for setting my crotch on fire in shop class.
Hurt like the dickens.
Point is, haters gonna hate. Shake it off.
Taylor Swift, always right.
The reason bullies get to me is because I lived with one... my dad.
He was a cruel man who didn't like his life, and he took it out on me.
Okay, okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.
If you're having dad problems, that's my jam, son.
Real weird take on my crappy father.
You know how I turned the corner with my dad?
I stood up to him, and that's what you need to do with your dad.
No, he died in 1988.
Oh, okay, well, that probably won't work, then.
But it doesn't mean you can't go over to the 6-5 and stand up to those bullies.
They'll just make fun of me more.
What are you talking about, Terry?
You are a human mountain.
You have more muscles in your ears than I have in my entire body.
Never skip ear day, Jake.
You can crush metal with your bare hands.
You can lift a city bus.
You can make your boobies do that bouncy thing.
They're called pecs.
Same thing.
Now, get on over to the 6-5 and make those big jerks take back that tiny kitten.
Yeah. All right.
I'm doing it.
[lively music]
Didn't work.
I have more kittens than before.
What? How?
Morning, Sarge.
Oh, good morning, my sweet, little cuties.
Don't call them cute.
They'd kill us all if they were smart enough to use weapons, but you're not smart.
You're dumb.
You're always naked, and you pee in a box.
I suppose they're not totally naked with the fur.
Anyways, you know how you didn't solve that case 20 years ago?
Thanks for reminding me.
You don't see me bringing up how you burned your junk off.
That didn't happen.
There was just some light blistering.
The point is, the only thing those bullies have over you is that you never solved that case.
So why don't we solve it together?
How are we gonna do that?
We'll sneak into the 6-5, steal that old case file, and work it till we find your burglar.
Then we march back into that precinct...
And we grind these kittens up and shove them down their throats!
Yes!
[whispering] Don't listen to him.
You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves.
Well, good morning, Linetti.
Whoo, I slept like a frickin' baby last night.
Staying at Chuck's is like a dream.
Little guy loves doting on me, although you're gonna need to buy some bigger underwear if we're gonna be sharing, you know what I mean?
Okay, I'll get right on that.
Okay, cool. Here.
Take care of this for me, will you?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get some breakfast candy.
Okay, catch you later.
So things are going really good with the new roomie, it seems.
It's horrible.
There's someone's blood all over the bathroom.
He sleep-choked me twice.
And the worst part... this morning, he ate all of my cereal.
That's the worst part?
They were Nortfluskers bran circles!
I had them shipped from Oslo.
Oh, I want him out.
But I'm too scared to tell him.
All right, listen.
I know that your spirit animal is a caterpillar that's been stepped on...
Mm-hmm.

She was either at a restaurant or the movies or doing something else.

Sure, maybe none of the work we did today led to any new information.
Jake...
And sure, most crimes are solved within the first 48 hours, but they never talk about the crimes that are solved within the first 100 million hours.
No, look at this.
The guy who inspected this elevator in 1996 was named Zerb Gudanya.
That's the same weird name who inspected the elevators in all four of the buildings we've been to today.

I don't understand why you wasted another night on a case no one's ever gonna solve.
Sarge, I am way too sleep-deprived to deal with your negativity right now.
Let me show you what I did.
I started off by making a map of all of the burglaries that have gone down in Brooklyn since 1996 to see if there was a pattern.
That led me to this.
There is so much crime in New York.
No one should live here.
Anyways, I tripped out on that for a couple hours, but I got cheered up after a took a picture of the kitties messing around in my little hoodie.
I'll show it to you later.
So basically, you wasted a whole night.
No, no, no, my friend.
No, no, no, 'cause then I dove back into your file and found this.
Cool, the low point of my entire life.
Sarge, this photo was taken in 1996.
You told me your guy broke his spine two years before that, so '94.
Check out his sneakers.
'95 Jordans.

Good luck following this party, ya bish.
I'd like to make a toast to the groom-to-be, Adrian Pimento.
Don't bother, Jake. Everybody's pissed at me.
No, no, we're not. We're all supporting you.
We're doing separate checks, right?
I told you, we're splitting it.
All right, sure, tonight got off to a weird, rocky start, but you know what else got off to a weird, rocky start?
America, and we all love America now, right?
Well, it's no Amsterdam.
And you know who else we also love?
Rosa Diaz.
Some of us even love her so much that it makes us act a little crazy sometimes.
You're talking about me, right?
Yeah!
Ah, I would kill all of you for her.
That's sweet. Right?

Easy on the dings, man. One ding'll do.
Thank you guys so much for this party.
It means everything to me.
And I'm sorry that earlier I went a little off the rails, hijacked the bus, stole all of your wallets to double check your identities.
What?
But with friends like you, I'm finally starting to feel like...
There he is!
[grunting and shouting]
I got him down!
I got him down! Somebody check his pockets!
What the hell? Man, this is crazy!
Sarge, look.
A gun and a picture of Pimento.
What do you have to say now?
I guess someone's trying to kill him.
That's right! In your face!
Someone's trying to kill him! Whoo!
I mean, a man's life is in danger.
Probably shouldn't be so pumped.
Look, I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm also sorry that someone's trying to kill you, but I can really only take ownership for the first part.
It's okay, Sarge.
I would've doubted me too.
I mean, you guys probably haven't noticed anything, but I've been acting pretty unstable lately.
Well, personally, I think I also deserve an apology.
No? Okay, that's totally cool.
So what's our plan?
Okay.
I'm gonna make this guy talk.
Okay, all I need is a car battery, jumper cables, and unfettered access to his nibs.
As much as I'd like to see that, I think you might be a little too close to this.
Maybe I should ask the questions.
Hey, Jackie, if you're asking the waiter questions, find out when the mashed potatoes are coming.
He's not a real waiter, man!
Hang on, we don't know that for sure.
Are you a waiter as well?
Mm-mm.
No.
Yeah, Terry was right.
Yeah.
So, you had a picture of my friend and a loaded gun.
Can't wait to hear what crazy story you tell to justify that.
I'm a contract killer who was hired to kill Adrian Pimento.
Oh.
That went much easier than I was expecting.
Still gonna brag.
[clears throat] I did it, guys.
I broke him.
Who wants me dead?
Someone in Figgis's organization?
I don't know. I haven't met the guy.
Once I finish the job, I'm supposed to text him a photo of the body.
Then we meet up and I get the money.
Interesting.
So he has no clue what you look like.
Mm-mm.
Gentlemen, I just thought of a plan.
Stage Pimento's death and go to the meet-up ourselves.
Great plan, Sarge!
No, I was gonna say it first.
I thought of it before you did.
You know, whatever, let's just do Sarge's thing, I guess.

Where we goin'?
A restaurant.
Specifically, Le Petit Colon.
It means small intestine, 'cause that's all they serve.
Oh, man, I was rootin' for you.

Thank you for all finally showing up.
Let's recap. As you know, Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis put out a hit on Adrian Pimento, which the mob believes succeeded.
For his safety Pimento has gone off the grid.
Remember, the only people we can trust with this information are in this room.
And Genevieve. We can trust Genevieve.
We share a life. I tell her everything.
Fine, the people in this room, and Genevieve.
Genevieve's mom also knows, but she's in a coma, dead any second, we're good.
Okay.
Unfortunately, we can't just arrest Figgis, because he has a man inside the FBI.
The good news is, we have a lead that's gonna break this case wide open: Maura Figgis, Jimmy's sister.
She's currently serving in a maximum security prison in Texas.
A white woman in prison, in Texas?
[scoffs] She must be bad.
She murdered three people, and she knows Figgis's operation, so we're sending a detective in undercover as an inmate to get close to her.
Yeah, and guys, this isn't one of those women's prisons that we've all seen being all sexy on late-night cable.
You know, with the ladies touching each other's bits, and there's kind of some lame jazz playing.
When these chicks fight, it's for real.

But, since you mention it, Mahler was one in-your-face bad boy.
Right, um, so, what's going on, sir?
Oh, I have a plan to draw out Figgis's man in the FBI: Throw a funeral for Pimento.
Now, before we, quote, unquote, bury Pimento, we need to, quote, unquote, open an investigation, find a, quote, unquote, corpse, and obtain a, quote, unquote, death certificate.
Kind of feel like you could have just used ""air quotes.""
I can also wear short pants and drink for a jug that says ""XXX.""
Fake funeral's a good idea, sir, but where are we gonna find a corpse?
We don't need one.
We just need pictures for the case file.

Okay, be cool. Let's check him out.

And no scar.
He's just a glove-wearing freak with beautiful hands.
Why did he run then?
He's a pickpocket.
I guess the bereft are easy targets.
Also, Scully, here's your wallet back.
How's Amy doing?
Is she paying enough attention to her pelvic floor?
Ignoring that.
She is keeping a low profile, just like we discussed.
I'm really impressed with you two.
You disagreed with the best strategy, but talked it through like adults.
Well, the key is trust.
I trust her to stay out of danger, and she trusts me not to interfere.
Oh, my God.
She just pushed Figgis into the garbage.
She's in danger. I must interfere.
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?
Showing my unborn baby how an ass gets kicked.
[growls]
All right, Cortez, time for your checkup.
[sighs] No, thank you, I feel fine.
No, you don't.
It's your uterus, it's... gonna explode.
What?
Come with me.
Stand back, everyone. You're all in the splash zone.
[groans]
This ute's gonna boot.
Here we go.
[sighs]
What the hell?
We agreed you weren't gonna do that.
You disobeyed a direct order from your handler.
Yeah, I did. Because that order was crap.
I did the right thing and it's insulting that you don't see that.
Hey, hey, hey.
The baby can hear you yelling and it's upsetting him.
It's a fake baby, Charles.
I meant me. The baby's a cover.
Okay, stop.
You're right. I'm 100% in the wrong.
The truth is, I'm the one that's not tough enough to be in here.
I mean, watching the woman I love, unarmed, locked up with all these murderers.
It's just too much for me.
Oh, my God. Amy, go to him.
I screwed up.
No, you didn't.
I get it.
Being a cop and dating a cop...
It's harder than I thought it would be.
I worry about you too.
Oh, my God. Jake, go to her.
Look, I was just trying to keep you safe, but I wasn't letting you do your job.
I'm sorry.
Why aren't you going to each other?
I think I have to take myself off of this assignment.
Are you sure?
Absolutely. You got this.
Hopefully, I haven't already blown your cover by dragging you into my office so many times.
Also, I'm pretty sure a lot of people heard me say that your baby's blood type is ""OG.""
Yeah, you're a pretty terrible doctor.
Mm-hmm.
But... I think I know how to get things back on track.
Hey, Cortez, you're late for your appointment.
Quit touching me.
Oh! Ugh!
[grunts]
I don't need checkups every two seconds, you dimple-chinned freak!
Oh! Aah... ow!
You're so tough and I'm just a beautiful intellectual.
[grunts]
Hey, I love beating up doctors.
Can I get in there?
No! He's mine.
All of you, back off!
I'm kicking for two.
[yelling, groaning]
Sorry that wasn't Scar-Joe.
I don't want to talk about it.
Talking about your feelings is for losers.
I guess Adele's a loser in your world.
Look, the funeral's almost over, we basically pulled it off.
All you've got to do is give a convincing eulogy.
Roger that.
Pimento's dead.
Thanks for coming.
[sighs]
Adrian Pimento was very special to me.
And now he's gone.
And I'm starting to realize... there's nothing I can do to bring him back.
I guess life is just gonna suck for a while.
But it's nice to know there's a room full of people who is sucks for too.
I'd also like to add... the next person who hugs me gets their necks snapped.
And... she's back.
Okay, this is it, I'm leaving.
You're in charge.
I'll take extra good care of her, Jake.
Just let her do her thing.
But this is Texas, so also make sure she doesn't somehow get the death penalty.
Mm-hmm.
Stay tough, Cortez.
You're touching her boob. Should I turn away, or...
I'm not touching her boob. She's tiny on the screen.
I'm just saying good-bye, man.
You know, why don't I turn and give you privacy?
No, don't turn. That's what makes it weird.
Ugh!
[upbeat music]
Well, we pulled it off.
Nice eulogy.
I thought it was dumb.
Sergeant?
Excuse me?
You said there's nothing you can do to bring him back, but you're wrong.
None of us are gonna stop fighting until he comes home.
Thanks.
And if you ever need to talk, or get drunk, or throw stuff off a roof, I mean, I don't know your process.
Am I hitting on anything here?
The roof thing sounds pretty good.
Very well. Let's throw something off the roof and then we'll get back to work.
High five.
I quite like them now.
What are you looking at? You got a problem?
Whoa. Cool it, killer.
I just wanted to say good job on beating the crap out of that doctor.
Oh. Thanks.
I like you. You got balls.
Maybe you should come work for me.
I could use a bruiser on my crew.
I'm not a bruiser.
I'm a psycho.
Even better.
Nice job, Cortez.
Oh, I touched her boob. I've got to tell Jake!
Not a doctor.
Shh.

I called you here to discuss where we are with Operation 225641441636324.
What?
I assigned a numerical value to each letter in the word ""pimento,"" which I then squared.
Oh, Captain.
How dare you try and sneak math into this?
Peralta.
Update us on Santiago's undercover prison operation.
Yeah, she has made contact with Jimmy Figgis' sister, but it's slowgoing.
I hope she comes back soon.
Aww. You miss her?
No, I lost the key to her apartment, and I'm taking care of her fish.
They're all dead already, aren't they?
Yeah.
Damn it.
Our priority is still finding Figgis' agent in the FBI.
I think it's time for me to call in a favor from an old colleague at the bureau, Bob Anderson.
I would've contacted him sooner, but this is a rogue op, and he's a real stickler for the rules.
He once picked up a penny off the street, which he then reported on his taxes.
Sounds like a barrel of laughs.
Fortunately, he isn't.
We worked together back in the day and really hit it off.

You mean that woman and her baby?
Yep. Idiots.
Oh, here comes Bob.
Please behave.
Hello, Bob.
Good to see you.
And you. Apologies.
It's inappropriate for me to partake in such informal conversation in front of your detectives.
It's all right. I am equally to blame.
Oh, my God.
There's two of them.
So, Raymond, what evidence do you have that there's a dirty agent in the FBI?
Let's see the file.
We don't have a file.
You're working file-less?
We saw the guy commit a felony.
He tried to have a cop killed.
Crazy hot cop.
Well, he's a specific type.
Look, the guy we're looking for was wearing a ski mask, but he's about 5'10"". Caucasian.
He's got a big scar on his right hand.
We've been calling him ScarJo, like the actress, Scarlett Johansson.
What? An actress?
I didn't know that was where that was from.
Bob, I'm so sorry.
No, I'll look past it.
Okay.
There's an agent that matches that description.
His name is Ryan Whealon.
You think you could ID him if you saw him?
Oh, yeah. I'd recognize that scar from 20 miles away.
You must have fantastic vision.
Or it's a gigantic scar.
I was clearly exaggerating.
Why do you have to ruin everything?

Dr. Schwartz, I'm here for my appointment.
Hello, Cortez. Shabbat Shalom.

Well, I'm part of her crew, but she still won't talk about her past.

So, what kind of stuff did you used to do in New York?
What's with all the questions, Regis?
Actually, it's Michael Strahan now.
What?

She's so scary.
I saw her pull her own tooth out and throw it into a woman's eye.
Yeah, that's bad. So guess what.
Genevieve just texted.
We're gonna hear about our adoption any minute.
I thought you were doing fertility treatments.
We are, but it's not going well.
The doctor said my sterility is so aggressive, it may have spread to her.
Okay.
But, adoption! Charles, that's amazing!
I know!
Oh, no.

Maura.
[both clearing throats]
Anyway, Ms. Cortez, your v*g1n* looks great.
Mazel.

Did you see this morning's newspaper?
No. I get all my news from a text message chain with my friends.
[gasps] The attorney general might step down!
I'm kidding. It's a GIF of a rabbit eating spaghetti.
There's an article about the Nine-Nine's monthly crime rate.
Those numbers aren't supposed to be public until next week.
Terry, you're gonna have to be more interesting if you want to get an ""oh, dang.""
There's a leak in the Nine-Nine!
Oh, dang.
I presented those numbers in a morning briefing, but I can't imagine anyone would be stupid enough to leak 'em.
Really, Terrence? Look how dumb they are.
Ugh!
D'aww!
Printer's fixed.
Oh, dang.

Tell Peralta Whealon's approaching.
Here comes the douche bag.
Gray suit. Act natural.

Wow, look at that. What a great magazine.
Sir, if you're interested, the new issue of ""Clown Boobies"" just came in. I can unpack the box for you.
What?
Oh. Haha.
Actually, no. I need last month's.
There's a particular clown... booby... that I'm looking for.
What is Peralta doing?
He appears to be rifling through ""Clown Boobies Magazine.""
Whoa!
Stupid butterfingers.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Here you go.
[radio static]
Thank you. Thank you so, so much.
Not thank you. Not thank you at all, you dirtbag.
Hey, Cortez!
What's going on with you and that doctor?
You seem real tight with him.
No, we're not tight. I barely know him.
So why were you hugging him?
My last appeal got denied, so he was comforting me.
He's a sensitive guy. Maybe because of his Jewish faith.
I want to talk to him. Alone.
Oh. About something medical? Or...
What did I tell you about asking too many questions?
Right. That's that thing you killed a bunch of bitches for.
[quietly] Ah. Got it. Sorry.
We've been watching this guy all day.
Can't believe we haven't even arrested him yet.
We know he's the guy.
We have to build a case first.
4:13 p.m. Subject finishes his coffee. Or tea.
Mark the beverage as ""unknown.""
Detectives.
What does the FBI database tell us about Whealon and Figgis?
Both of their files were completely wiped.
I've never seen that before.
Yeah, that's because he's guilty, and we're just sitting here watching him eat a peach.
That's a nectarine.
It's either a nectarine or a peach.
Just write ""unknown stone fruit.""
There can't just be digital files.
There must be hard copies.
Those are all under lock and key in the archives.
If I asked for clearance, they could alert him.
Interesting.
So what you're saying is our only option is to break into the FBI and steal the file.
Don't be absurd.
Bob, I apologize for the absurdity.
I see no absurdity.
Actually, I think Peralta's right.
Let's plan a heist.
Bob?
Blueprints for the New York Headquarters of the FBI.
The file we're looking for is in the archive room, here, in the basement.
We will be represented by these things I had in my pocket.
All I had was lint. Just a pocketful of lint.
Everybody remember what your lint looks like.
My lint is round.
My lint is approximately 1 centimeter in diameter.
My lint is blue.
My lint is oblong.
My lint is approximately 1/2 centimeter in length.
My lint is also blue.
Wow, so no pushback on the lint thing? This is great.
Now, I can give you clearance to get in the front door, but getting into the archive is another matter.
If I go into this bathroom, I could climb through this vent, drop down into the archive room, and steal the file.
How are you gonna get out?
Pull myself back up the way I came in.
What? I can do a pull-up. Terry will teach me.
This whole area is video-monitored by this guard here.
I can distract him with conversation.
What do you know about him?
Watches a lot of TV.
I heard him mention ""s*x and the City.""
Then I will discuss both of those shows with him.
Ooh. ""s*x and the City"" is one show.
It's not a show called ""s*x"" and then another show called ""The City.""
Okay. Good start.
Now I know that.
Oh.
I can disable the security DVRs, but I need some way of getting to a station unnoticed.
I have an idea on how to smuggle you in, but it'll be a tight fit.
I'm flexible. I do a lot of yoga.
You do yoga?
Helps keep me centered. If you ask me about it again, I'll hunt you down and rip your face off.
Okay. Great. Good plan. I won't ask you about it again.
I got the DVRs.
Actually, that's my lint. My lint is oblong.
My lint is blue.
Okay! Sounds like we've got a plan. Let's get to training.
[Charles exhales heavily]
Why does she want to meet with me? You think our cover's blown?
I don't know, but, just to be safe, let's review your backstory.
I went to Yeshiva med school, residency at Mount Sinai, my best friend is Yacob Peralberg, and we share everything with each other.
Can't imagine that last part coming up, but okay.

You got this.

Well, Isabel, your baby's head is the perfect size.
Oh, thank you, doctor.
Still gonna hurt when it comes out. Get ready for that.
So you're Dr. Schwartz.
That's me. L'chaim. How can I help you?
I've been watching you ever since you showed up here.
You don't seem like the other doctors that we've had.
It's funny... my best friend, Yacob, is always saying that.
Oh.
Cut the crap.
We both know why I'm here.
We do?
Your heart's beating a mile a minute.
It's not because I'm nervous!
Cortez says that you're sensitive. I like that.

And I will see you soon, doctor?
Mm-hmm.
Later.
Yeah. Later.

Curse this perfect butt.
How dare you, sir?
Do you really think we would leak information on purpose?
No. We think you're dum-dums and you did it by accident.
Oh. Well, that's very possible.
Yeah, I could see that.
The briefing was a week ago.
Just tell us everyone you talked to since then.
Well, let's see. On Saturday, I got together with my friends, and we went to the dog track.
We need names.
I lied. There's not multiple friends.
It's just Scully.
Okay. What about you, Scully?
Well, I went to the Knicks game with a buddy.
Was this ""buddy"" named Hitchcock?
Yes, and we weren't at the game.
We were at the dog track.
Oh, come on, guys.
Is there anyone you could've told the crime stats to?
Crime stats?
Wait. Do either of you even know what our arrest numbers were?
12.
No!
Then no.
Yeah, they're not the leak.

Sure, she melted down when he tried to introduce her to his parents, and she flipped out when she bumped into Big getting out of that cab with Natasha, whom he had married.
Hmm. Who can blame her?
They barely knew each other.
The best episode that year... was episode six, entitled ""Are We Sluts?""
You know the one. Carrie was all in her head because she and Aidan weren't having s*x.
Meanwhile, across town, Charlotte couldn't stop having s*x.
And Samantha? Samantha was just being Samantha.
The season finale that year was entitled ""Cock-a-Doodle-Do.""

Pop quiz.
Greg, where did you go to college?
Ohio State, where I majored in... communications.
Perfect.
Larry, what's your favorite movie?
Uh, ""Die Hard.""
Wrong.
Jake's favorite movie is ""Die Hard.""
I asked you for Larry's favorite movie.
Two people can have the same favorite movie.
They can, but they don't.
Larry's favorite movie is ""Failure to Launch.""
Say it.
Say, ""My favorite movie is 'Failure to Launch.'""
My favorite movie is ""Failure to Launch.""
[gulps]
I wish I could believe you.
Moving on, three weeks ago an informant told the FBI where to find Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis.
Acting on that lead, 50 federal agents and I raided a warehouse in Paramus.
It was awesome.
So you got him... it's over. We can go home?
No, sorry.
Figgis wasn't there.
The raid was awesome.
Caught up with a lot of dudes I don't normally get to see.
Do you know what happened to Figgis?
No, but what we do know is that Figgis was never there.
Our Intel was wrong from minute one.
Is there any way we could help with the investigation?
No, absolutely not.
Your involvement would endanger your lives and this case.
[sighs]
I'm sorry, but it looks like Larry and Greg will be in Florida indefinitely.
Pop quiz, Larry: who's the female lead in ""Failure to Launch""?
Kate Hudson?
Sarah Jessica Parker, man!
God, it's like you want to die.
[exhales]
So we're in Florida indefinitely.
You okay?
I squirt-anly am.
Poor choice of words, but the sentiment remains.
What? You were right.
It's the job. It keeps me focused.
Well, good, I'm glad to hear it.
Yep.
Now if you'll excuse me, I got to drive this Bee-otch back to work.
What?
Oh, sorry.
This is the Ikura Bee-otch 5,000.
Brand-new model.
Just came in.
I was gonna go for the 10,000, but that Bee-otch is way too fancy.

Okay, Jimmy Figgis.

Oh, Larry.
So I marched in there and I told him I wanted that assistant manager position.
I wish my son had your backbone.
Then he could finally divorce Emily.
What does he see in her anyway?
Probably her breasts, which are heavier than average.
I don't mean to be crude, ladies, but that's just how the straight mind works.
Oh, hey, Larry.
Ah, hello, Groot.
Greg.
Right.
Is there an issue with our shared fence that we must discuss?
Nope, our shared fence is fine.
Just off to work.
[engine turns over]
Is there something going on at the ATV lot?
Yes, uh, having a sale on... big, old springs.
Shocks.
Right.
I knew that; I was just dumbing it down for you.
At any rate, I am off.
Honk, honk.
I don't know where the horn is.
[engine rumbling]
Gahh! What the...
ATVs?
The only thing you're selling is a huge pile of bunk.
How did you get here so fast? You were walking.
I was power-walking.
Roll heel, ball, toe... roll heel, ball, toe.
I was already suspicious about your new positive attitude towards Florida, a state you once described as ""America's stinky butt.""
But then, after we met the marshal, you said something very strange.
It was ""squirt-anly,"" wasn't it?
No, something much stranger.
[slowed audio] You were right.
I knew then that you were up to something, so I followed you here.
I guessed the combination on the first try: 69-69.
June 9, 1969, the day my parents got married.
No, it isn't.
My mom's birthday.
No.
The moon landing.
Nope.
Fine, you're right.
It's a completely random number.
Look, the feds are useless.
They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.
I want to get home and see Amy.
Don't you want to see Kevin?
Of course I do.
But we were told not to get involved.
Why can't you just follow orders?
Because I hate this stupid place, and I've got to get out.
This town's claim to fame is that its mayors keep dying, and no one knows why.
That's insane.
You're selfish, and you're putting my life at risk.
So no, you're not getting those files back.
I suggest you accept the reality of the situation and make the best of it.
Snap out of it, and get a job.
Okay. Interesting idea.
I wonder who's hiring.
Hey, everyone, just want to introduce you to our new assistant manager, Larry Sherbet.
[applause]
Son of a bitch.
Larry, you want to say a few words?
Absolutely. Thanks.
Hey, everybody.
Uh, couple things about my management style.
Number one: don't nobody ask me about what's in my cup, we ain't gonna have no problems.
[laughing]
Uh, two, I believe in the power of nicknames.
Smile Face, Señorita Swag, Kahuna!
Oh, yeah.
And you, my friend, we will call Mr. Fart.
Seems rather unprofessional.
He called you ""Mr."" Fart, Mr. Fart.
Thanks, Kahuna.



Guys, can I get real with you for one sec?
[slurping]
I used to work for a real stickler... the type of guy that just got off on telling me what to do.
One time, he invaded my private space and stole my stuff.
Why would he do that?
Perhaps he had a good reason.
Wrong, Mr. Fart. He was a jerk and he sucked.
But he was the one who motivated me to get off my ass and get this job, so in a way, we really have him to thank for all this happening.
[applause]
Give it up.
How great is this guy, Greg?
Wait, that's Greg?
Yeah.
The stoner?
Yeah, look at him. He's such a Rasta.
Aw, total Rasta.
[laughing]
How did you even get this job?
You have zero experience.
I guess you lied on your resume.
[chuckles] Greg, you stoney macaroni...
[whispering] Of course I lied on my resume.
Our entire lives are a lie.
I straight up said I was that guy who landed the plane on the Hudson.
Taking my job just to spite me... that's low, even for you.
Oh, but it's not spite.
It's blackmail.
I'm gonna be your boss, and I'm gonna make your life miserable, unless you give me back my Figgis file.
Oh, never gonna happen.
Okay. Suit yourself.
Hope you like kids' birthdays.
Hey, everyone, someone just volunteered to be DJ B-Day.
Here at the Fun Zone, we live by one rule: when it's your birthday, you're always cool.
Parents and kids are all the same.
Watch... as I do a dance... to your name.

D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek.
D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek.
Again.
Figure out what's living in there yet?
Well, uh, judging by the empty beer cars, the fur, the pornography, and the claw marks, I'd say a homeless man and a raccoon.
The exact nature of their relationship is still revealing itself.
I'm gonna assume sexual.
You ready to give me those files yet?
No.
Well, then, I guess it's time for your next task.
You're gonna need to change.
Into what?
Oh, Mr. Fart.
You look perfect.
So a silly costume... is that all you got?
Hardly.
Every time a go-kart drives by, I want you to scream... and this is very important...
""Me so corny!""
You can ruin my job, Larry, but that's not all I've got here in Florida.
I've got a life.
I've got friends.
You sure about that?
Honestly, Estelle, it almost sounds like you should stop eating beef altogether.
I know. That's what I keep saying.
Oh, go to hell, Larry!
That's my walking group!
Off to get my file?
No, you will never get the f...

Are you okay?
Yes, but we got bigger problems.
This is gonna break the Internet.
No, no, ma'am, please, you can not put that on the Inter... oh! [grunts]
[laughing]
I was hoping that would happen.
Yes! Yes!
I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that.
No, it's been like this since I broke it playing football in high school.
Fine, I petted a horse too hard.
If that woman posts her camera phone video that she took with a camera phone camera to the Internet, Figgis could figure out where we are.
This is your fault.
Or maybe it's your fault for stealing my files.
You know what? It doesn't matter.
We have to get that video.
Can we please just press ""pause"" on this fight and work together?
Yes, on one condition: you stay the hell away from my walking group.
The walking group meant nothing to me.
That's even worse.
Okay, fine, I'll stop.

Camera was behind her.

It can't be that common.
That's the most common tattoo we give.

Nope, Pet Detectives.

Not yet.
Ran out of data on my phone because of all the p0rn I watched.
We don't know each other.

Dog track has free Wi-Fi.
Would you ever consider not uploading it and deleting it instead?
If our boss sees that video, we could be fired.
I don't care about you.

The only thing I need you to do is...
I'm not gonna show you my tattoo.
Come on, just give me a hint.
Is it an antique boat?
Is it a musket? Is it me on a dragon?
Sir, is it me on a dragon?
Boom. $15,000 cash.
Wow. How'd you get it?
Oh, you didn't.
You just stuck a few 20s around a bunch of corn dog coupons.

You know where I live.
You okay?
[grunts] Yeah.
A little sore, but...
Good.
Then I can excoriate you freely.
You half-assed living in Florida, and you half-assed getting the phone back.
You've probably blown our cover, which means the marshals will have to move us.
And when they do, I'm gonna demand they send us to different cities, because I don't want you anywhere near me.
I swapped the phones.
What?
I got the video.
Sorry.
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye, Greg.
Lastly, hole 13 on the mini golf course is missing, so tell all the players to just repeat hole 12.
All right, dismissed.
Damn, Greg, you are killing it as assistant manager.
I mean, having the idea to have people come in at 9:00 a.m....that has really helped business.
Yes, that is when the sign says we're open.

What if we don't find Figgis?
What if Figgis finds us?
But I thought you deleted the file.
I was going to, but this camera phone camera is not the same kind of camera phone camera as I have, so I couldn't figure out how.
But I'm glad I didn't.
I say we post this video and use it to lure Figgis down here, making ourselves into bait.
And once Figgis is here, we take him down, climb out of America's steaming orifice, and go home.

It's like numbers are so crazy, am I right?
Both: Amen.
Not really.
Anyway, there was this big drug bust going down.
I showed up, spooked the kingpin.
He darts for the front door, trips, shoots himself in the stomach accidentally, and then after that everybody pretty much surrendered very quickly and they made me a captain about a week later.
Didn't you have to pass the exams?
Like, wasn't there, like, an interview where they met you and... heard you speak?
Presumably.
Look, I'm going to be honest.

Your 2:00 is here.
Okay, thanks, Em, and while I'm in this meeting, will you just shred some documents for me?
Anything you see. It's all garbage.
On it.
What's going on? We were busy.
Busy trying to ruin everything around here with your dumb letter?
This is a gravy train, people.
Okay, C.J. will say yes to anything we ask for.
Rosa, dare to dream. What do you want?
For him to be gone.
You want that more than you want walls around your desk so Hitchcock can't stare at you with his big old google eyes anymore?
C.J. stays. I love that guy.
Yes!
What?
That's not fair!
Come on.
And how about you, Charles?
What do you want, baby boy?
Well, I agree with Amy that C.J. is totally unqualified and a disaster for the precinct, and I would really love a treadmill desk so I can hit my cardio targets.
Done.
Yes!
Boyle.
I'm sorry.
I'm doing it for Nikolaj.
You'll understand once you bear unto Jake a child.
[both groan]
Looks like you're all alone.
Em, can you go ahead and show her out?
Right this way, please, and can I validate your parking?
I work here.
So, listen, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
It shouldn't take much time.
Great, because we actually have someplace important to be, so if it would speed things up, we're happy to waive our right to counsel.
Wow, counsel, the ""C"" word.
Wait, wait, wait.
You guys in law enforcement?
No, no, no.
I just have a buddy who's a detective in the NYPD.
Whoo, I bet he's better than me at getting people to talk.
Everything I know about interrogation I learned from ""The Newlywed Game.""
Huh.
So, look, why don't you each write down your answer to these questions.
Okay, question one, what were you going to use the guns for?
Okay, and then read 'em out when you're done.
Both: Hunting.
Okay, see, I knew you boys were on the level.
Okay, question two: What do you hunt?
Deer.
Grouse and other small fowl.
Oh.
Yep, we hunt everything.
You know, deer, grouse, a horse once.
Yes, we love killing any animal.
[chuckles] I hear ya.
Okay, question three: You said you had somewhere important to go, so where exactly is that?
Dinner date.
Dinner date.
That's what mine says as well.
Sorry about the handwriting.
The point is, neither of us are lying.
Should we just pick up our keys on the way out, or how do you want to do this?
[slam]
No one has ever beaten ""The Newlywed Game.""
No one.
Hey, Diaz.
Right. The walls.
[sighs]



[doorbell rings]
Can I help you?
I need the crime stats from last month.
Fine. One sec.
Some people, huh?
Hey, I'm up to 20,000 steps.
Seriously, Boyle?
Oh, you don't care about my health?
You don't care about if Nikolaj grows up without a papa?
You want me to die?
Honestly? A little.
Hurts.
I can't believe they all let C.J. and Gina just buy them off.
But we don't need them, 'cause we've got you, and you're a sergeant.
Did you sign the letter yet?
Um... I...
What did he give you?
He gave me the ability to continue to serve this community unencumbered by a necessary oversight.
Now, I really have to...
What did he give you?
He gave me a yogurt fridge, all right?
I asked for a yogurt fridge, and I got one, right next to my desk!
I'm only a man.
I'm sending this letter with or without your signature.
Enjoy your blood yogurt.
I will.
Time is running out.
We have the right to a phone call.
We need to call the Nine-Nine so they can sort this out with the sheriff.
No, they would want to get involved and that could endanger them.
They'd be okay with that.
Charles and Amy both love me.
Rosa's not scared of anything.
I'm like a mentor to Terry.
No, regardless, we don't have time for that.
We just have to tell the truth.
Sheriff, I'm ready to talk.
This better be good.
I'm a busy man.
You just spent 30 minutes trying to win a radio contest.
For my wife.
They're giving away Swampsgiving tickets.
I'm not really Greg, and that's not Larry.
We're Captain Raymond Holt and Detective Jake Peralta of the NYPD.
We've been targeted by Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis, the mafia boss.
We're in witness protection, and that is the full truth.
[sighs]
[laughs]
Good one. That's a good one.
Just call the U.S. marshal who handles our case.
She'll explain everything.
She? [laughs] Oh, come on.
This is getting crazier by the second.
But I'll tell you, I kind of want to see how it plays out.
Uh-huh. Right.
Okay, will do.
Well, it's a guy, and he says he's never heard of either one of you.
That's impossible.
Listen for yourself.
Hello.
 It's Figgis.
I have your marshal, and I'm coming for you.
See you soon, Jake.
Wait.
[line clicks]
[dramatic music]
Great news.
I found Figgis.
This is bad.
Figgis has the marshal, and now he knows where we are.
We're sitting ducks.
That's the worst kind of duck.
Tell that to the Dutch Hookbill.
Look, the clock is ticking.
We only have one option.
Jailbreak.
And how do you propose to pull that off?
By using this rag-tag team of inmates.
Our very Suicide Squad.
All right, let's rally the troops.
Hey, fellow prisoners.
Hi, there.
Everyone, look, we haven't connected as much as maybe we should have.
That's our fault.
Why don't I just kick things off.
I'm Jake, and I like baseball.
Now you say something about yourself.
I'm Raymond. I don't care for baseball.
Great, so now that we're all vibing at 100, quick question: If there were to a be a jailbreak ""of sorts,"" how many of you guys would be interested in that?
Obviously if you have any moral objection... okay, your hands are already all up, so I say we hop on this pony. Great.
Now, do any of you have any special skills?
Maybe the ability to pick a lock?
Uh, I'm Mitch.
I have a glass eye.
Glass eye?
We'll definitely find some use for that.
How about you, sir?
I'm Evan.
I've been arrested for a lot of different stuff: public urination, urinating on private property, urinating 25 feet from a school, urinating out of a moving truck.
I don't think Evan gets what we're doing here.
Oh, doesn't he?
He's been here for weeks.
He knows the guard's comings and goings.
Thank you for sharing, Evan.
You are valued here.
Your turn, old-timer.
It's always guys like this that unlock the entire operation.
What do you bring to the table?
I'm Tito.
I'm great at smoking meth.
And?
Snorting meth.
And?
I haven't spoken to my daughter in a couple of years.
Oh, that's so sad.
Okay, so find something for Tito to do.
So I heard from One Police Plaza.
They received my letter, and apparently they also received hundreds of others in support of C.J.
Yeah, Emily and I sent those in, so...
Emily, what was that burn I had you write down for Amy because I didn't want to forget it?
""Why so sad?
""Did you just find out American Girl doesn't make clothes in adult sizes?""
No.
""Steven Seagal called and he wants his ponytail back""?
Huh-uh.
""Gina: Hey, Amy, what did one graphing calculator say to the other one? Amy: What? Gina: What does the sad lady own two of us?""
That's it? [laughs]
Hey, Amy...
You know what?
Congratulations.
You just made sure that a terrible captain will be sticking around here indefinitely.
Come on, Santiago.
We're just trying to make the best of it.
Yogurt?
Never!
Yes! 40,000 steps!
Boyle!
I can't talk.
I got to keep my heart rate up.
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
Need a roof on this thing.
Gina, I need a roof.
Emily.
On it.
Listen, you selfish jerks, that guy in there, the one playing the bongos right now, he thinks we're killing it, so he's just staying out of our way.
Well, the only reason we're killing it is because Captain Holt never let us be satisfied with ourselves.
He always inspired us to work harder and smarter, to be better.
And if he were here right now, he'd be ashamed of us.
Amy, wait!
Oh! Ah!
Ooh, ah!
You swear this guy's about to meet up with his mistress?
Yep. Tuesday at 5:00.
It's Tanya time.
Well, there he goes.
Okay, now we got to get rid of the other deputy.
Glass eye, you're up.
Oh, so much drier than I would have thought.
Did I want it to be wet?
Jake!
Right! Sorry.
Just holding an eyeball in my hand.
No big deal. Here we go.
Yah.
[glass shatters]
What the hell?
Must have gotten too hot.
Sheriff, I'm going to go get a mop.
Okay.
And... great.
Now we stage a fight; when the sheriff comes in to break it up, we take him down.
All: Fight! Fight! Fight!
Ah!
[all groan]
We got us a jail fight.
Yah!
[laughs]
Why isn't he coming in?
I don't know, maybe he's not buying it.
Hit me harder.
Oh!
Damn, you knocked him.
[rock music]
What would it take for him to intervene?
Do I actually have to kill you?
No, he'd probably love that.
Ugh!
But you know what he would hate?
Okay, just go with me on this, all right?
Ugh.
I can't stay mad at you.
♪ ♪
Ooh! No! No!
Is it working?
I think so.
Not in my jail. No, no.
Break it up! Whoa!
Stop it! What are you doing?
It's 2016, man.
This is on you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't give me anything to do.
You have the most important job of all.
Tell everyone what you saw here today.
Oh, God bless you.
You're giving an old meth head a reason to live forever and...
We don't have time for this, Tito!
Hey, Santiago, come with me a sec.
Why?
So you can show off some new cool thing that C.J. got you?
Let me guess, golden suspenders?
Can you imagine? I would look amazing.
But that's not what I came here for.
Just follow me to the captain's office.
Hey, guys.
If Pac-Man were a stapler, he'd look like a little something like this.
Okay, so we wanted to talk to you, Captain Stentley...
Uh-oh. Captain Stentley.
Am I in trouble?
No.
You're our boss.
Oh, right.
Are you in trouble?
No, sir.
It's just that the squad feels we've been taking advantage of you, and it has to stop.
So...
I returned my yogurt fridge.
I gave my treadmill desk back.
I took down my desk walls.
And I have agreed to fire my assistant's assistant Dana.
Dana? Who's Dana?
Emily had a lot on her plate.
I don't understand.
I mean, I'm just trying to make you guys happy.
Well, if you want to do that, start acting like a real captain.
Make tough choices.
Tell people no sometimes.
Okay, if you think I need to stop doing whatever you guys want, then I will.
Yeah, that's progress.
If that's what you guys want.
I gotta go.
Good talk.
My door's always open, except when it's closed.
But you can open it when it's closed.
[siren blaring]
I can't believe we're fugitives on the lam, falsely accused of a crime.
There's nothing false about it.
We committed several felonies and escaped from jail.
Yeah, but we were just doing what we had to do.
We're the good guys. [gasps]
This is what they all think.
Figgis is in town, and we have no car, no money, no guns; we can't go back to our houses because the police are looking for us.
It's time to call the Nine-Nine.
Absolutely not.
What is going on with you?
Nothing, I just think that we can do it alone.
Sir, we just shared one of the longest kisses of my life.
I think we can be honest with each other.
All right.
The Nine-Nine bailed me out once before when I was taken hostage by Bob, a man I had put my trust in, like a fool.
I don't want them to rescue me again.
It's embarrassing.
I need to clean up my own mess.
Captain, it's the Nine-Nine.
There's nothing wrong with asking for help from people that care about you.
[phone ringing]
This is Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Captain Holt!
Sir. Captain Stentley.
There's an urgent situation, and we need 72 hours off to go to Florida.
Now, I can't why...
Absolutely not.
What?
The Eight-Six said they would cover for us, and this very important!
That's enough.
Someone once told me that being a captain means telling people no.
Oh, wait. That was you guys. You guys told me that.
Anyway, you're right. You can't go.
Sorry, guys.
I kinda feel like this is my fault.
I kinda feel like this is my fault.
Not now, Emily.

04x03 - Coral Palms Pt. 3
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=28884,"





You're watching Channel 36's ""Power News Live at Five.""
We've got the most high school sports, the most lottery numbers, and the most weather in the Tri-Swamp area.
It's news time!
Good evening, I'm Brynn DeRose.
And I'm Slade Austin.
Tonight on ""Power News,"" we reveal who Donald Trump is running against for President.
Plus, we'll show you the winning lottery numbers.
Could 67 be one of them?
Two prisoners have escaped from the Coral Palms sheriff's station in a daring daylight jailbreak.
The men, identified as Gregory Stickney and Larry Sherbert were arrested after a routine traffic stop revealed a cache of automatic weapons.
Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell.
Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with... really, I am, kiss whoever you want... except they were both men.
Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.
I do a lot of meth.
The sheriff's office is coordinating their search with local and state police.
If you're watching, Greg and Larry, and I know you are, my men and I will not rest until we find you.
That's right, we're coming for you.
Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?
The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead.
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies.
Okay, I'll get some water.
Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme: Code Rad.
Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?
We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a...
""hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh.
Good call.
All right, let's get out of here.
And in Coral Palms, law enforcement still is searching for a pair of fugitives who broke out of jail earlier this evening.
Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert are believed to be unarmed but dangerous.
Liquid Moan, nice.
I wore this to Swampsgiving last year... cleaned up.
Right on, bro.
Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad.
It comes with a free cigarette.
Oh, no.
That doesn't matter. We don't need it.
Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it.
No, no, no. Don't do that... smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
Hey...
Ahh.
We seem to be in the clear.
Are you hurt?
Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf... it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's gonna be fine.
Oh, my God!
I got rifles, vests, flash grenades...
Chips, dips, ice cream sammies...
I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully.
Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!
Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission.
Really? Then what is this?
Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake.
All right, bad news.
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
Left, right, left, right, both, both, both.
That's so cool!
I still can't let you go to Florida, though.
Terry feels like a whore.
He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences.
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
Great, Hitchcock's in. Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
Shut up, Hitchcock. Obviously, we're all going.
What's up, squadron?
I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies.
Yeah, about that.
Um, there were no tickets left.
But I brought my minivan, so...
Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
Needles, needles, need... whoa!
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right. This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut.
Ahhh, I saw inside of you.
How are humans alive?
Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?
We'll get you through this.
Okay.
Ugh, what was that sound?
I did not like that squish sound.
The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
Okay, this is almost over.
You're doing great.
Just keep talking. Keep talking.
Talking about what?
Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?
You must be excited to see her.
Very much, you know.
Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?
We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?
Uhhh!
Keep going, keep going.
You're doing so well. Why would it be weird?
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, maybe we've grown apart.
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And... guess what?
What?
I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
Huh.
You did great, buddy.
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia.
Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth.
Oof, poor Jake.
Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks.
So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?
Aren't they a little young for that?
They're four.
Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me...
I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad.
Mm-hmm.
Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom.
We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
I didn't have to then.
So does this van have side-impact airbags?
Not in the back.
Oh. Interesting.
No judgment here.
Sarge, I have to pee now too.
Seriously? You, Diaz?
Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?
I have to pee really badly.
Hot.
What?
Hitchcock!
Guys, enough!
Sarge...
Yeah, I know! You got to pee, I got it!
No, brake lights!
Oh, crap.
Everyone hang on! There's no side-impact airbags!
Did you get breakfast?
I tried, but I got recognized.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
Oh, boy. What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
Where are we gonna go?
The cops?
Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.
Oh!
Jake?
Amy...
It's so good to see you.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
My dad died, and...
Again, when this is done, Hitchcock.
Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it.
So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him.
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
Any questions?
Yes, did you miss us?
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
Yes.
Knew it.
All right, once we get to the Fun Zone, I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
Captain, you stay here and rest.
What? I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
All right, then stand up.
Easy.
I love standing up.
Yeah, you're staying here.
Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?
My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?
Terry, I'm gonna need your gun.
That's not happening.
All right, I'll use my own.
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable. Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that. Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
Now come on, guys, let's get ready.
Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi.
Yeah. Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my God, everyone, Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes! Now get to it, you lovebirds.
Here we go.
Come on, man.
How did you get there so fast?
Love finds a way.
Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around.
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
No, those are actually always there... something about lead being in the air and water and ground.
Anyways, you all have your assignments.
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine! NineNine!
Chills, you guys.
Literally, chills.
Hey there, Nikolaj.
It's your papa.
If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me.
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
Sorry, I was making a video for my son.
You know, in case I never see him again.
Do you not do that for your kids?
Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now.
Hey... hey, girls.
It's me, Daddy.
If you're seeing this, I'm dead.
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian.
Ligo! Ligo! Ligo!
Yeah, yeah, lullaby time. Look.
Go to sleep, Daddy's dead But his ghost's always watching



What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call. Blocking the door.
Keep it up, smorty-pants.
Oh...
Uh...
Mwah.
One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned.
This is weird.
Should we have s*x?
What?
Huh?
Yeah. I mean, no.
No, things aren't weird, or no to the s*x?
Maybe we should just...
You're right.
Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later.
No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis.
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
Yeah, unless he kills us first.
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
Wow, things are clickin'.
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in... in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like, ""At this point, I hate you.""
I'm like, ""Oh, really?
'Cause you didn't hate me last week.""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right? God, I missed our daily dishes.
Me too.
I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own.
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
Sir, they're gonna be fine.
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
Well, I'm not gonna let it.
Let's go.
But my wound, Gina.
Sir, with your brain and my body... and my brain... we make one unstoppable unit.
Now climb aboard, sir.
And let's go.
Oof.
All right, everybody ready?
Good. Let's set this trap.
Hello.
Hello, Figgis.
Peralta.
Congratulations on escaping prison.
Thank you. Congrats on sucking.
You know, I'm bored.
I'd love to kill you tonight.
So where you hiding?
Wouldn't you like you know?
Round one.
You're never gonna find me.
I'm invisible.
Mommy, I won! I won a big pwize!
Downtown!
I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere.
And I'm coming for you.
Peace out, loser.
He's at the Fun Zone. Gear up.
This ends tonight.
Uh!
Ow!
Oh, sorry, babe.
What were you aiming for?
Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling.
I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine.
Cool.
Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
On the same page.
Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
Yeah.
Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just... want us to be normal again.
Yeah, me too.
I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
What?
Why did I say that?
Why did you kiss Holt?
I didn't. I did.
We did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything.
Just forget I said anything, right?
Rewind.
And kiss.
Jake...
You want to know if there was tongue.
I can tell you, decidedly there was not.
No, Jake. Figgis is here.
Okay, well, good talk. Don't die.
Holt had very soft lips.
Wish I hadn't said that one either.
We should get into positions.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, kill the lights! Figgis is here!
Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used.
Broccoli Che visto?
It's being used.
Quanti erala Vito la Bella?
Tutto matro lamente?
Just bring it back when you're done.
Ah! Garbanzo marinara!
Pizzería restaurante!
Ahh!
Jackpot. Let's do this.
And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
Gracefully.
Boost my bottom!
I'm boosting!
Boost my bottom!
I'm boosting!
Boost it!
Ah. All right... stick shift.
I can't drive stick shift.
You're gonna have to drive.
How? My leg doesn't work.
Sir, I am a dancer.
I will be your legs.
Clutch in.
Okay.
Clutch out.
Oh!
Hoo-hoo!
We are the best driver in the world!
Spread out and find 'em.
Bogie headed to the ball pit.
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot I'll take your best shot, I'll take your best shot!
Boom
Here comes the.
Boom
Ready or not.
Here comes the boys from the South.
Is that all you got?
I'll take your best shot.
Well, it's all right 
I'll take your best shot
I'll take your best shot 
Boom.
Here comes the
Boom.
Ready or not, ha ha, how you like me now?
Peralta...
Holt.
I know you're here.
I'm gonna kill you.
I don't think so.
Oh...
Put down the weapon, Figgis.
There you go.
Oh, yes.
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.
Drop it, Sherbert!
What? No!
I've been everywhere, and I finally spotted your minivan with the New York plates parked around back.
We already got all your friends. So drop it.
You don't understand. I'm a detective with the NYPD.
This is Jimmy Figgis; he's wanted by the FBI.
No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio, and I came here to repair a skee ball machine on the the fritz, but suddenly he's trying to kill me.
He's lying. ""Constantine Binvoglio.""
It's clearly a name he just made up.
I'm very impressed. That was pretty good.
I will shoot you, Sherbert.
All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go.
Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.
No!
Now let's me and you take a little walk.
Ooh.
How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?
Do you even have a plan?
I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again.
Pfft.
You're scrambling.
Look, I told you, we're NYPD.
Yeah, right.
I can prove it.
Look up ""Brooklyn detective attacked by birds.""
You'll see an article with a photo of me.
Officer down.
All available units respond.
I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake.
My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD.
Get back.
I'm reaching for my badge.
Keep walking.
Let him go.
Put that gun down, or he dies.
He's not gonna shoot me.
He needs me alive to get out of here.
Yeah, you willing to take that bet?
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
Oh!
You shot him!
Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
It was. It was awesome.
It was actually just like the end of ""Speed,"" which is a pretty good movie.
It's not as good as ""Die Hard."" ""Die Hard""'s perfect.
Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis.
Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis.
Same page, still.
Get out of the car!
Young Jeezy take the wheel!
Freeze, punk!
Yeah, freeze, punk!
Gina, where did you get that gun?
Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em. They're everywhere.
Hey, Figgis.
My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you, I should read you this letter.
""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby.""
Oh, that side's for me.
""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy.""
We're sorry we doubted you, sir.
You really saved our butts.
I can't take credit for that.
Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind?
Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today.
Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital.
Hey, how's the sheriff?
Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!""
So I think he's fine.
Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. How are you doing?
Fine... you know, just getting bandaged up.
Actually, can you give us a second?
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now.
Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?
Yeah. B positive.
Well, guessed wrong.
Hey, Craig?
Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back.
How was Florida?
It was fine.
A lot of college girls.
Come on, man.
Now, before you say anything, I know we disobeyed a direct order.
Sergeant, relax, okay?
Your friends were in trouble; you did what you had to do.
And now I got to do what I got to do.
Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?
Much worse... you're never gonna see the sun again.
Your families... they're gonna forget your faces.
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime and dinner at breakfast.
And you'll...
Ah, what was I talking about?
I totally lost my train.
You were punishing us.
Yes, thank you.
Ah!
I'm transferring the whole squad to the night shift.
Noooo!
Yes.

[grunting] Hey, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.
So what's this secret meeting all about?
You guys know I'm not medically cleared for another week.
It's not a secret meeting, Jake.
It's an intervention.
[razor buzzes]
The tips have to go.
What? Why?
Jake, we're worried about you, and you look very stupid.
C'mon, guys.
I think they're kind of cool, retro.
No, they're terrible.
Amy, come on.
You're digging the tips, right?
No, I feel like I'm kissing Vanilla Ice.
There was a time you would've jumped at that chance.
They have to go.
[laughs nervously] All right, you guys got me.
I did it as a joke.
I kept them ironically.
Pretty funny, right? [laughs]
I'm just gonna head out.
Get him!
No!
[all screaming and grunting]
Yes, Terry!
[both screaming]
[gasping] Okay, okay.
Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'll admit it.
I went too deep down there in Florida.
At one point, I think I forgot where the tip of me ended, and the base of the tips began.
Before we just chop 'em off, 'would anybody like to say some final words?
No.
That was one word.
That counts. Thank you, Rosa.
Okay, I'm ready.
[razor buzzing]
Sorry I'm late everyone, but trust me, it's worth it.
Me and Jake are tip buds.
[yelling] What?
[screaming] No!
Both: No!
You know what... I do see it. It's bad.
It looks bad.
♪ ♪
Brace yourselves 'cause Jake-y is back.
[mimics a train whistle]
Don't everybody mob me at once. We can high-five one at a time.
Oh, I see... no response.
A little ""welcome back to the precinct"" hazing.
Who's behind this cute little prank? Diaz?
Kill yourself.
Okay.
I told you.
Night shift has everyone a little down.
Yeah, just because you don't get to sleep or see your loved ones or feel the sun or do anything that brings you joy.
That's all.
I personally like the night shift.
You know who else is up right now?
Murderers? Armed robbers?
[Australian accent] Australians.
It's an whole new demographic for me to conquer.
[normal voice] I already have the third most followers behind Iggy Azalea and the Perth Zoo Wallaby cam.
Wow, that's pretty good.
It's not just good, Jake. [chuckles]
[Australian accent] It's bonzer.
Night shift is boring. Listen to the cases I've had: Drunk and disorderly, drunk and disorderly, cyber crime...
Ooh, cyber crime.
Pretty cool.
Caught a drunk guy humping a laptop.
Well, we've all been there.
But my point is this: I don't care what time it is.
I'm always happy to be here.
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Niiine!
A-Noine-Noine!
I'm gonna keep doing it until you guys chime in.
A-Noine-Noine!
Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
What is wrong with everyone?
I'm worried our night shift morale problem has gotten worse.
Yeah, you think?
I'm sorry.
I'm exhausted.
My wife says when I get tired, I get night sassy.
Night sassy?
Hearing problems, much?
Sorry.
Should I just go tell everyone to buck up and do their jobs?
No, the squad's only on night shift because they came down to Florida to save Jake and me.
It's my responsibility to fix this, so I'm going to brighten the mood by telling a few jokes.
Try this one on for size: I don't care for cheese.
I'm a... curd-mudgeon.
Wow.
You're too tired for humor.
If he isn't taking his medicine, you could mix it in with his food.
Sorry, you can deal with your sick dog later, Boyle.
Well, actually, that was about my son, Nikolaj.
He's got allergies.
I think we may have to go with a nasal douche.
Ah, nasal douche.
Cool, cool, cool, cool. Very gross.
Anyways, I'm back to being a cop.
It's all I've thought about for the last six months.
Hurtful.
But I won't be fully back until I've solved a case, just like old times.
And I can't do that without my partner.
Pfft, you're not solving any cases on the night shift.
Lohank?
Oh, my God, you look...
Beautiful?
I was gonna say ""less sad.""
Ever since I moved to the day shift, I'm happier, healthier, my stepson gave me my debit card back.
Lohank is happy and confident?
Everything's off.
[gasps] Oh, no.
We're in the Upside Down.
That's right.
I'm gonna tell you the same thing they told me when they removed my testicle: Welcome to your new life.
Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let the night shift win.
Me and my main man Boyle are about to solve a case.
Isn't that right, Charles?
Oh, you know we will.
We'll call ourselves the Night Boys.
Kind of sounds like a male escort service.
The Midnight Men.
Even worse.
The Dark Stallions.
Looks like we're going with the Night Boys.
Whoo!
[sighs] I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but the night shift is taking all the fun out of paperwork.
Mm-hmm.
At least we're getting to spend quality time together.
Totally... I'll be back in 40 minutes.
What? Where are you going?
We have to finish this by morning.
Yeah, I know.
I just have something important I have to do.
What?
I have to get...
Some pens.
Then why are you putting your jacket on?
Pen store's a block away.
The nearest pen store is seven blocks away, and it doesn't open until 9:00 a.m.
I learned that the hard way.
You really think you can lie to me?
No.
A-ha!
You're lying to me right now. You do think you can lie to me.
Yep.
Wait.
Hang on.
Was that a lie?
I don't know, maybe.
All right, see ya.
[sighs]
Ah, our first case.
Tasty little B&E... just what the doctor ordered.
Not actually, she recommended another week of bed rest.
I was like, ""Whatever, dorkus.""
[laughter]
Ah, check it out: Ducking under police tape.
I missed this.
[grunting and screaming]
Charles...
Yep, yep, on it, on it, Jake-y.
I got it.
Got it.
What do we got?
Back window's broken, two sets of sneaker prints, alarm went off at 11:43, and security arrived at 11:46.
Perps were already gone.
Okay, I'm thinking classic us.
I'm thinking old times.
I'm thinking...
[together] Rigity-rigity-role playas!
Yes, okay, I'm Jacques Guillaume, and you are Henri Renault.
We are cat burglars on vacation from France.
I love it... although Henri went to an elite international school, so he does not speak with an accent.
Wow, nice, way to flesh out the characters.
Thank you, okay, so I break the back window, make my way over to the jewelry case.
Meanwhile, you're standing lookout by the front door...
Oui, oui.
Smoking a cigarette.
Check it: Ash.
[French accent] Ooh la la.
Okay, so I am smoking.
What are you doing?
Oh, Jacques rolls his own cigarettes, a habit he picked up from a prostitute in Marseille, but that is not all he picked up.
Why do all your characters get STDs?
[normal voice] Because they're living life!
All right, so I go to the first case... smash... steal a bunch of watches.
Move over to the second case... smash... bracelets.
But then, we hear a sound, and...
I yell, ""Les gendarmes! Ils sont ici!""
And I know what that means because I'm French, but I ask you to repeat it in English, just to be sure.
Police are here.
Yes, we gotta get outta here, so we turn to leave, you flick your cigarette.
Using the cane, using the cane, this is awesome.
[gasps] Voila! Zee butt.
I thought Henri didn't have an accent.
It comes out when he gets excited.
Great news, everyone.
We just got our first lead on our first case on my first night back, proving once and for all that absolutely nothing has changed.
[grunts]
Yeah, this opens in instead of out now.
They switched it a month ago.
Yeah, so the door changed, sure, but that's it.
Well, we have got ourselves a case and a key piece of evidence.
We should be wrapping this thing up in no time.
As long as we do it before sunup.
As soon as the shift is over, I kind of have to get home.
But we're gonna work until it's done, right?
I mean, that's how we do it.
Yeah, I just like to be home as soon as Nikolaj wakes up so I can make him breakfast.
Sure, yeah, not a problem... we'll be home by sunup.
Just like a couple of sexy ""Twilight"" vampires.
[as Dracula] I am Robert Pattinson.
I vant to turn into a bat.
[normal voice] I've never seen the movies.
No, me neither... they're an insult to the books.
Okay.
Crank up the tunes, Boyle.
The Night Boys need an anthem.
Something dark, something tough, something...
I already got it.
[Lionel Richie's ""All Night Long"" playing]
You know what?
I'm into it.
The night shift won't slow us down.
Why is this going so slow? Where is everyone?
Well, it is 3:00 a.m.
It's a pretty bare-bones crew.
Hi, can I help you?
Are you lost?
Can I get you something... coffee, tea?
You know what... we're in a bit of a hurry.
Can you run this DNA for us?
Well, of course.
Sorry, not many people stopping by at night.
Sometimes it makes you like... [blows raspberry]
[squelching] Right?
Both: Uh-huh.
I'll be back in a sec.
Cool.
Yikes... not exactly the A-team at this hour.
""A-Team,"" are you guys talking ""A-Team""?
I love that show... I could download it.
We should binge it.
This is gonna be fun.
Yep, totally excited to watch five full seasons of television with you, but could you actually run the DNA for us first?
It kind of feels like you're prioritizing work over our friendship.
Because I barely know you?
Fine, message received.
[upbeat music]
Oh, welcome back from your third massive break of the night.
Thanks.
I was being sarcastic.
Where do you keep going?
Not saying.
Tell me, Diaz.
Nope.
Come on, tell me.
Not talking about it.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me...
Fine.
I was in the bathroom. I'm having stomach problems.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's real bad...
No, that's all right.
You should've been there.
I don't have to hear it.
It was like a massacre.
No, you can... please stop.
Multiple flush.
Please stop.
Attention, squad.
Everyone, gather 'round.
I've been researching ways to raise morale, and I found an interesting article in a scientific journal.
Oh, was it from ""The American Journal of No One Cares""?
According to a recent study, the physical act of smiling can improve your mood.
I suggest we give it a shot.
Eh?
Now you all try.
Big smiles, bigger, bigger!
Great, now we just have to stay like this for the next two hours.
Can you feel it working?
I don't have any enamel on my teeth, so the cold air is excruciating.
Maybe if you brushed your teeth once in a while, this wouldn't be a problem.
I do brush my teeth.
They're decaying from acid reflux.
You're embarrassing yourself.
[Australian accent]
Crikey.
You're not Australian, Gina.
Get stuffed, ya drongo.
Guys, seriously, too much exposure to air, and they will turn to dust.
This isn't working out as well as I'd hoped.
Time for the next level: Forced laughing.
[laughs]
Well, that lab tech took a long time.
Once we agreed to go to his birthday party, he was actually pretty fast.
But, most importantly, we got a DNA match.
We're looking for... Dave Smith.
Sounds like a real piece of crap.
You said it.
Now we just gotta pull his files from records.
Yep, then we bust him, and we'll be done with plenty of time before Nikolaj wakes up.
[correcting] Nikolaj.
Hm? Nikolaj, yeah, I said it.
Nikolaj.
Nikolaj.
Not even close. Nikolaj.
Nikolaj.
Almost... Nikolaj.
Nikolaj... I feel like I'm saying it.
You know what... it doesn't matter.

Oh, is that not allowed?
It is not.
No problem, we just close these tabs...
You've got a lot of them.
Mm.
Type 3 and type 9 and 12 and 13... those are all the diabeteses I have.
It's true what they say: Night shift makes for strange bedfellows.
In your dreams, perv.
Ugh. Rosa?
What the hell? She said she was in the bathroom again.
Nah, she hasn't been to the bathroom since 8:27.
[yelling] What?
Also... ew.
C'mon, Hitchcock.
Busted. [laughs then sighs]
Man, this Dave Smith's bad news: Armed robbery, aggravated assault, attempted murder...
Well, he's about to get a visit from the Night Boys.
Gah, this stupid limp is slowing me down.
Charles, can you...
Oh, give you a piggy?
What?
Yeah, jump on it...
I'll give you a piggy. [snorts]
Actually, I'm good.
I was just gonna ask if you'd hold my bag.
Oh, yeah, sure, makes more sense.
Yeah.
Embarrassed.
Anyways, this is great.
We're definitely gonna catch this guy before sunup, and you will be home to see your kid.
Oh, no!
Son of a bitch.
[knocking]
Jake, come on in.
Nikolaj, look who it is.
You remember Jake Peralta.
From the stories.
Yeah, we talk about you at bedtime.
Ah.
Look at my cement truck.
He loves trucks.
Cool, it's cool, buddy.
Hey, listen, I know you're with your kid, but I checked the file, and our perp's last known address is like two blocks from here.
Really? We gotta go take him down.
Yes, there's the Charles I know.
Tonight, Dave Smith goes down.
Tonight?
No, Charles, we gotta go now.
You saw this guy's rap sheet... he was arrested for attempted mur...
Tickling, tickling... attempted tickling.
Right, tickling.
Look, uh, Charles, this guy's a real... doodyhead, all right?
He tickled once... he may tickle again.
He might be tickling as we speak.
We could be dealing with a serial tickler.
[sighs] I really want to go, Jake, but I'm here alone with Nikolaj.
Genevieve doesn't get back for three hours.
So let's just take him with us.
Nah, that's crazy... or is it just crazy enough to work?
Just crazy.
Ah, man, it stinks you've gotta watch him... it's really messing everything up.
I mean, that came out wrong.
I love that you have a son... it's not messing everything up.
Just messing up our ability to solve the case and have fun.
Ah, you know what I mean.
I'm a nice guy... I'm in the right.
I'll just go myself.
Bye, Nikolaj.
[correcting] Nikolaj.
Yeah, whatever. See ya.
I know your shift is over, and you've had a challenging night, but I think I've found a new way to raise morale.
Follow me to the briefing room.
What's all this?
It's an after-work hang.
Just trying to turn up, as it were.
We got snacks, games, decorations, chairs...
Yes, chairs.
Cool, maybe we can mill around and small talk about how some of us are big lying liars who lie all the time like a bunch of liars, Rosa.
I don't think that's good party convo.
Uh, maybe we should just name our favorite sailing knot.
I'll start.
The bowline.
How about some tunes?
[upbeat Sousa march]
Cool, merry-go-round music.
Yeah, John Phillips Sousa, the Skrillex of his day.
C'mon, people, hit the dance floor.
Have a good time.
Why is no one having a good time?
I specifically requested it.
Gina, why aren't you dancing?
I can't. I'm in the middle of a feud with the ""that's not a knife"" guy from ""Crocodile Dundee.""
He's being a real bitch.
Fine, I guess I'll just... stop the party.
I didn't realize it ever started.
Enough.
I tried to make this fun.
I even learned what Skrillex was.
Sorry you're all miserable, but guess what.
So am I.
I'm exhausted all the time, I never see my husband, the late-night NPR programming... pure garbage.
I'm done trying. We can all be miserable together.
Just go home.
Hey, I saw you earlier.
You weren't in the bathroom.
You were on a park bench playing on your phone.
Yeah, you left me to do everything while I thought you were pooping.
I wish you were pooping. I wish to God.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Rosa, crying... don't know what to do.
Pat, pat.
This feels wrong.
We put away Figgis three weeks ago.
Pimento should've been back by now.
We had plans to meet on that park bench once the coast was clear, but he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's deep undercover, or he doesn't remember who he is, or maybe he's dead.
Wow, thanks.
You're right, my fiancé's a total weirdo who's probably dead.
I'll just give up on him and go do my paperwork.
No, Diaz, wait... maybe he's just really, really injured.
Come on, Amy.
All right, Fiske, Jones, Thompkins...
[gasps] Smith.
Smith.
Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze!
Slow down! This isn't fair!
I have a cane.
[panting]
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
NYPD.
NYPD... I need to commandeer this vehicle.
It's a crossover.
It's a crossover SUV, and you can't have it.
I'm a cop... can you please get out of the car?
No, this Schmidt's mom's car, and I'm more scared of her than I am of some two-bit thug.
I'm not a thug... I'm police.
Okay, then name one law.
Don't kill people.
That's on me... I set the bar too low.
Look, can you please just get out?
Okay, you can drive, but I'm not getting out.
Right.
Also, I have the seat warmer on... I don't just have a really hot butt.
Doesn't matter to me... a perp is getting away.
Oh, it's very hot.
[car screeches]
I can't believe this is happening.
Thanks a lot, New York.
You know what, if your city's so great, then how come it's not the state capital?
What... who cares about the state's capital?
This is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of.
That doesn't sound right... where dreams are made of?
I don't know... you tell me.
It's your dumb city.
It's grammatically odd.
Whatever, I'm sure wherever you're from has strange songs written about it, too.
Los Angeles?
Damn it, all the songs there are so good.
[yells]
[grunts]
Hey, watch my soup.
I'm chasing a criminal. Your soup is not important.
You took an oath to serve and protect.
That applies to my soup.
You know that's not what the oath is about.
You're making a point you don't even believe in.
Garbage truck!
[both screaming]
[tires screeching and glass breaking]
Oh.
Damn it!
He got away.
Well, I spilled my soup.
You tell me which is worse.
My thing. Very clearly my thing.
Captain Holt, can we talk to you?
What is the meaning of this?
Am I the subject of a punking?
It's a beginning-of-work hang.
And why are you all in such good moods?
Because you told us that you're miserable, too.
And that means you'll fight to get us off the night shift, right?
Well, here's what I have to say about that: The night shift stinks... stinks like a butt. And I will do everything in my power to make sure we get back to the day shift.
What are we standing around for?
Put some Sousa on already. I want to get wild.
Well, well, well, if it isn't one of the world-famous Night Bros.
It's the Night Boys, and... why did I correct you?
I would've preferred ""Bros.""
Did you solve your case yet?
No.
Night shift, am I right?
You remind me of me.
It's not the night shift, okay?
I found the perp, and I would've taken him down, but I'm hobbled, and I didn't have a partner because ever since Boyle had a son, that's all he can focus on.
Whoa, hey, are you angry at Boyle for having a kid?
No, I'm just mad because I'm working the night shift, and I have to use a cane, and, yes, the one thing I could always count on no matter what... Boyle being there for me... is also gone.
What do you say we let day shift Lohank take a crack at this?
[sighs]
I'm gonna put a little something up in the old hopper.
You tell me if it vibes with you.
That's so gross.
Life moves forwards, not backwards, and things will never be as they were.
And you can be angry about that, or you can embrace the fact that your best friend now has a son.
How cool is that, amigo?
Ugh, ""amigo.""
All right, fine, yes, I'll admit it, it is pretty cool.
Boyle's wanted it for a very long time.
I guess I haven't actually spent that much time with Nikolaj yet.

Nikolaj.
Man, am I seriously about to take emotional advice from Lohank?
You know you want to, compadre.
Go to him.
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have said that about Pimento.
I'm sure he's gonna come back.
I'm not even thinking about it anymore.
That wasn't even me crying in the bathroom earlier... that was someone else with these same boots, but now she's gone.
Look, when Jake was in witness protection, and I didn't know when he was ever coming back, you were always there when I needed to vent.
So I'll do your paperwork, and if you ever want company on that bench, I'm there.
Thanks... I would advise against it though... if he does come back, things are gonna get real raunchy, real fast, like, do a lot of licking, that's probably indecent exposure...

Okay, got it.
You know what... I'll just start with this stack right hehere.

I can't work the case tonight.
Nikolaj's allergies are acting up, and now the dog seems to be allergic to him.
It's this whole thing.
Did you find Smith?
No, uh, he actually got away.
Sorry, man.
Ah, it's all right.
It's the day shift's problem now.
Whatever happened to working until it's done?
Honestly... Lohank kind of talked some sense into me.
Lohank?
Yeah, it was so gross, but I want to apologize.
For what?
Well, I kept talking about how I wanted everything to go back to normal, but if that actually happened, this little guy wouldn't be here.
Or is he big?
I don't know what size kids are supposed to be, or anything about kids, really.
I think maybe that's part of the problem... it doesn't matter.
I got a present for Nikolaj.
Thanks, Jake. Come on in, give it to him.

Hey, little man.

You wanna know something cool?
A truck just like this almost killed me today.

I'm going to stomp on your dreams.
It's fun to see you so passionate.
I will slit you both open from mouth to anus and wear you like jackets.
Wow. Is it weird that that turned me on a little bit?
Doesn't matter.
But let's move on.
The plaque will be held in this.
Is that my childhood caboodle?
It most certainly is, but don't worry.
I removed the scrunchies, old report cards, and photos of young Al Gore.
I'm better-looking than him anyway.
We're talking a young Al Gore?

Peralta, you do make me laugh.
Okay, stings a little bit.

Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history.
How are you gonna do it?
I was kinda hoping you would.
I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present! [laughs]
Of course I will!
That's my girl.
[cheerfully sighs] All right.
Listen up, people.
The next 14 hours are gonna be hell, but in the end you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you've finally done something worthwhile with your lives.
I kinda think the police work we do...
Eh-eh-eh!
I don't have time to stroke your damn ego, Sergeant.
Let's make a wedding!
Hey, Jake.
I need a wedding favor.
Of course. Anything.
Except killing someone, or maiming someone, or breaking the law in any way, or nudity.
Also I don't like waking up super early in the morning... you know what, why don't you just tell me what you want?
Cool, I need to go to Neustadter, New York.
I gotta pick up a pair of ruby earrings I pawned before I went into hiding.
Neustadter's like six hours away.
I'm not so sure we can get there and back in time.
Jake, there's no wedding without the earrings.
My grandmother wore them on her wedding day, and said they blessed her union.
Do you want this union to be blessed, Jake?
Or do you want this union to be friggin' unblessed?
Blessed, totally blessed. I'll do it, it's fine.
But I should warn you, my car is a piece of junk and it's always breaking down.
Ah, come on!
The universe isn't gonna let anything bad happen to two best friends... unless we're in a fiery crash, and our bodies are burned beyond recognition.
Ooh, Gina's got jelly beans!
Pimento, no.
Bad.
Sorry, Gina.
[murmurs]
That was amazing.
He actually listens to you.
Hey, you should come with us on this trip.
You know, in case he starts acting...
Bat crap loony tunes.
Yes.
You can use your powers to keep him in check.
Yeah, people fear me.
Mm.
The only reason I'm not your boss right now is 'cause I'd hate to do that to Holt.
He needs this.
And also you're not a cop.
Well, you're not the basis of a character on ""Empire,""
Jake, but I don't throw that in your face every damn day.
So you will come with us?
Yeah, I'll be there.
You da man!
Bye, girl!
See ya in the car, girl.
Okay. First, the good news.
I've generated a detailed timeline broken down into 30-second increments to keep us on track.
The bad news: we're already 16.5 increments behind schedule.
Oh, man.
Terry feels overwhelmed.
Good! Use it!
Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed when he walked on the Moon, but you know what he did?
He walked on the Moon!
Charles, you're in charge of food.
I've been planning a nuptial menu since the day I met Genevieve.
Warning, it will be delicious and highly erotic.
Your menu is not gonna involve animal genitalia, is it?
No, I was gonna make... not that.
Terry, you're on hair and makeup.
I've seen your little girls' pigtails, so I know you can do it.
They actually prefer my hair work to their mommy's.
[giggles] I love their little heads.
[whimpers]
Terry, what's going on, man?
It's just a matter of time before I'm doing their hair at their weddings. [stammers]
It goes so fast. They're still babies!
Pull it together, Jeffords!
Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating.
Smart move, Amy. I've been called the Leonardo da Vinci of sitting on my ass.
Great.
And, Captain, you can help me decorate.
I'm at your disposal, just tell me what to do.
I'm here to implement your vision.
Well, we just wanna keep it classy.
Got it. Balloon arch.
What?
Say no more, it's done.
I'm off to the nearest balloon store.
Okay, Rosa.
You go to the office, have a couple bellinis, and just relax.
What's a Bellini?
Peach juice and champagne.
Peach juice and champagne? What am I, six?
[sighs] Come on, just try it.
It's what Nancy Meyers would drink.
Fine. For Nancy.
So, big day. How you feeling, buddy?
Good, giddy. [laughs]
I've never felt giddy before.
Didn't realize how close it was to hungry.
You know, it's possible you're just hungry.
When's the last time you ate?
Uh, three days ago?
Ah.
You excited for being married?
Yeah! I love Rosa.
I can't wait to just jam my tongue in her earholes, and eat the hair off her head.
Hoo! I'm giddy.
Aw, that's cute.
All right, we're looking for 381 Smith Street.
It should be up here.
Hopefully they still have your earrings.
You sure we're looking for 381?
'Cause 381's looking a little crispy.
Oh, no. It burned down.
How did this happen?
Uh, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine.
We'll think of something, all right?
Nope!
This is a sign from the universe.
I can't marry Rosa.
Guys, the wedding's off.
Oh, no, no, no! [groans]
That's it! We're not getting married.
This is a disaster.
Come on.
I mean, they're just earrings, right?
We can get another pair, or we could make some new ones.
All we need is, like, a blacksmith.
Or a smelter... a smelt man. That can't be right.
The point is you can still married.
No, Jake. You don't understand.
The universe is sending me a sign.
And when the universe talks, I listen!
Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so...
What? Then you deserve to die.
Ah...
The sign was real.
If I ignore it and marry Rosa anyway, I'm basically asking the universe to stomp on my balls.
Okay, good point.
Hey, Gina, I could use your help here.
You wanna maybe weigh in on this one?
Yeah, sure.
You're right. The marriage is cursed.
What? No! You weighed in wrong.
I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen.
And I'm not taking your side against the universe's.
It's hundred of years old.
What if there was something in the universe that could prove to you that you should still get married? What would that be?
Finding his grandma's earrings.
Or we could cut Rosa's ears off, and then it's like the earrings don't even make sense.
Thank you! Someone's trying to help.
Okay, so the earrings.
Maybe somebody bought them before the place burned down, right?
We could track 'em down.
And lookee here.
I just got the owner's name. That's good, right?
Okay, maybe there is a little bit of hope.
[snaps fingers] You're damn right there is.
Suck it, universe!
Are you crazy?
Why would you even say that?
Come on, man!
How are the chairs coming, guys?
Shh. We're working!
This one's good.
Okay.
So we'll go with that one?
No, I said it was good.
I didn't say it was right.
Wow, you're taking this really seriously.
Amy, will you taste this batter?
Mm-hmm.
Hmm... I think it's a little off.
You know what's off? Your mouth!
Why Jake lets your stupid tongue anywhere near him, I'll never know.
Nope, I forgot the sugar. That's on me.
Whoa, you really made the balloon arch.
Made? No. I birthed her.
There's no form more graceful than the arch, no object more whimsical than the balloon.
Yes, you and I think that, but... what will Rosa think?
Good point.
Rosa would want a much, much bigger balloon arch.
Back to the balloon store.
Uh, Amy? We've got a problem.
What?
Rosa's drunk.
Rosa? No. How?
Bellinis rule!
Nancy Meyers, you've done it again, you saucy bitch.
For the last time, I don't have your earrings.
They didn't survive the fire.
Aw, no, this is really bad.
Well, not necessarily. I mean, maybe the universe allowed something else to survive, you know?
Like a rabbit's foot.
I don't think you understand how pawn shops work.
I don't think you understand how they work. Yours burned down!
I'm so sorry you lost everything.
I'm just really worked up. No, please don't!
Okay, so...
I know that seemed like a little bit of a dead end.
[chuckles]
She's got the earrings.
She does?
She stole all the merch, and then burned down the store.
She was wearing a necklace that I also pawned there.
Oh, snap! Signs on signs on signs!
Are you sure it's the same necklace?
Uh, yeah, Jake. I once punched it through a guy's throat, so I'm pretty sure I remember it.
I stand corrected.
All right, I'm gonna call the local police and get a warrant.
Oh, don't bother.
Let's just kick down the door, and take back what's mine.
No! No, no, no. That's a bad idea.
He's right. Just use the lattice.
The upstairs window's open.
No!
Nice!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to make this wedding happen. What are you doing?
Trying to keep us out of prison.
You know what, forget it. I'll just deal with him myself... nope, he's already on the roof.
Aha! Yeah, dog! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Rosa, what happened?
Sorry.
I didn't know you could drunk off champers.
I mean, it's half bubbles.
Don't worry, Amy.
I got this. I'm a master at sobering up.
Are you sure?
Uh, you don't go to the Renaissance Faire every weekend in your 20s without learning how to handle your mead.
Great. Thanks, Charles.
Mm-hmm.
Charles, I'm getting married today.
Yes, you are.
And I'm gonna make sure you are sober when that happens. Now I just need cayenne pepper and some horse milk.
Marriage is the best.
Hey, how come you and Genevieve aren't married?
Huh?
Uh... you know, it's complicated.
No, it's not.
It's easy. Bring her down here.
We'll all get married!
Yeah, right.
She doesn't want that.
Whoa, that sounds...
[blowing raspberries]
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. Uh-uh, no, no.
Everything's great with us.
I mean, if it was up to me, we'd get hitched, but she had a really bad divorce, so...
Oh, I'm sorry. Does that upset you?
I'm good! Yeah, I'm good!
I'm so sad.
I love her so much.
I wanna marry her butt so bad.
To Genevieve's butt!
To Genevieve's butt!



Look at all this crap. See, I told you.
They took all their merchandise, and burned their store.
This is a bad idea. We should leave now.
What? No. All we're gonna do is find the earrings, and then light this place on fire for revenge.
Check it out! Rainstick.
Keeping it.
No, you're not.
That is a crime.
Untrue.
Once you steal something, none of your stuff belongs to you.
I've heard that too.
No, you haven't.
No one has. Put that down.
Okay.
[rainstick trickles]
Gina! Be a quieter robber!
But you told me to put it down.
Hi, we met earlier.
You're breaking into my house?
Or are you breaking into our house?
Yeah.
Dino! Robbers! Dino!
Aha! I found the earrings!
Dino! Get up here!
Yeah, Dino! Get in here!
So you can watch me light your house on fire!
Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool.
Everybody be chilly chill chill.
I am gonna slice your face off!
Not chill, Dino.
[screams]
Let me in there, you sons of bitches!
Wait, wait!
The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time.
Smart.
[both screaming]
Whoo!
Ooh!
That was awesome! I love being a police officer!
That was the opposite of being a police officer.
We just robbed somebody.
Who robbed us!
The universe is back on track, baby!
We got grandma's earrings back!
And the rainstick!
Which you will be returning.
Uh, sure I will.
How are we doing on traffic?
Green all the way.
All right, looks like we're actually gonna make it in time for this wedding.
Thank you, universe.
Thank you for blessing this marriage.
[metallic clank]
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but this is not a sign.
I just have to pump the gas twice, and turn it back on.
This happens all the time.
[engine grinding]
[banging]
Oh, boy.
This has never happened before. Everybody out!
This is the worst day of my life.
The universe doesn't want me to marry Rosa.
Look, it's gonna be fine.
We'll get the car fixed and make it back in time.
Gina, when's the tow truck getting here?
No idea, I'm talking to my spiritual advisor.
He says we have an engine problem.
Yeah, I know, that's why I said call a tow truck!
So you meant my spiritual advisor is right?
Guys! This is my fault. I should've just given up when fate burned down the pawn shop, okay?
Stupid Adrian. Stupid Adrian!
Idiot! Read the signs!
Enough!
I'm so sick of this garbage, all right?
The two of you need to stop looking for signs everywhere... oh, my God, a sign.
Whoo! He can fly! Prop planes!
You can fly, you can fly!
I'm a vessel for the universe.
Wow. The chairs look amazing.
I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.
We're not? Who is?
My arch. Isn't she beautiful?
I got eye-rolled to, not about!
While Pimento stares at Rosa, we'll all be staring at... her.
Yes, we will.
She's truly breathtaking.
There's a double meaning to that.
The breath that it takes to inflate all those balloons.
Of course I used the hand pump, but the bon mot still works.
[loud thud]
Oh, no! What's happening?
Someone tell me what's happening.
I got some more bad news.
Oh.
Oh, wow. That thing's huge.
Didn't Rosa want things to be classy?
I mean, she's getting married, not finishing a marathon.
So says the hair guy.
Stay in your lane, bucko. Right, Santiago?
The arch sucks! I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss and you were so excited, but the truth is every time I look at it I wanna die and take you with me.
Well, I wish you'd said something before I spent all day making it.
Of course, you didn't want to... ""burst my bubble."" Pun intended.
And then... you did.
[pops]
[groans]
[pops]
Forget the arch! Charles didn't sober up Rosa.
She got him drunk!
Oh, no.
How drunk is he?
Remember the night they cancelled ""Bunheads""?
We're ruined.
It's fine.
I'll handle it. You got your hands full.
[whispers] Yeah.
[pops]
This is just 18 shots of espresso.
It got me through the first three months of having twins, but I imagine it'll sober you up too.
Aww, he's taking care of you.
Such a good father.
Ugh, I miss my father.
I used to be daddy's little girl, but we never talk anymore.
You don't?
That's what happens.
You grow up, your bond with your dad goes...
[blows raspberries]
[blows raspberries]
No, it doesn't always happen.
All right, not to special daddies who put the time in.
You know, read them stories, do their little pigtails.
Really, Sarge?
Who do you think used to do my pigtails?
Why can't they stay babies forever?
Berlini!
Bellini!
Bellini!
Okay, this is very scary, but it's okay, because you're a trained pilot.
No, I'm not. I'm self-taught.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You can learn anything online.
Ooh, you should see me do origami.
Oh, do you know how to do a frog?
Oh, no!
Can you do a swan?
No.
Can you do a crane?
What's a crane?
Okay, he does not know how to fly a plane.
All right, food is ready, decorations are set, guests should start arriving any moment, and the chairs are still perfection.
She said they're perfection. I'm so proud of you, buddy.
It was you. You made this happen.
All right! Let's show Rosa what we got.
Wait. Where is Rosa?
[laughter]
[shushes]
Narc.
And that's why you shouldn't drink.
Being drunk sounds terrible.
Hello, Amy, I didn't see you there.
How did the wedding go?
Terry!
What the hell, man? You said you were gonna sober them up.
It was her fault.
My girls are never gonna grow up and lose their virginity.
I lost my V-card to the woman that refilled Nana's oxygen tanks.
Her hands were so strong from turning the nozzles.
[laughter]
This is a room of nightmares.
You're the nightmare.
You made me kill my balloon baby.
Look at me.
So drunk, I'm alliterating like a beatnik.
Okay, everybody outside now!
Just know that you brought this on yourselves.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Can't we just go to sleep for a winker?
We're way past winkers.
Scully, Hitchcock, bring the frost.
[fire extinguishers whoosh]
[screaming]
No!
[squealing]
[continued screaming]
Nice job, you two.
We are nailing it today!
Hey! We're back.
Pimento's got the earrings, guests are arriving...
What the hell are you doing?
Sobering these clowns up.
All right, everyone go get dressed.
[sighs]
You would not believe the day I've had.
You and me both, sister.
Rosa got drunk, and then every time I sent someone in to help her, she got them drunk too!
It's like she was trying to tank this thing.
Yeah, well, Pimento called off the wedding three times because of the universe. If I didn't know them any better, I'd think they don't even wanna get married.
Both: They don't wanna get married!
Okay, so it seems like they don't wanna get married.
But is it even our place to say something?
No, right?
Right?
It's their decision, even if it's a bad one.
They could always get divorced.
People love getting divorced! My parents got divorced, and all it did was scar our family for years and years.
We have to say something.
Yeah.
I suppose I can see how a balloon arch might've been a little too much.
Oh, yeah, for sure.
No, you're supposed to say, ""This wedding looks like garbage.""
This wedding looks like garbage.
No, no. As long as the bride's happy.
Hey there, everyone. Great wedding so far, right?
Uh, next up, we're gonna take a quick break, which happens at every wedding, but in the meantime, how about a little entertainment?
Boyle? You got your devil sticks?
Always.
Hey, Adrian.
Yeah.
We gotta talk.
Really? Right now?
I'm working on my vows. Hey!
[snaps fingers] What rhymes with juicy heinie?
Nothing. Nothing rhymes with that.
I would cut that line.
But that's all I have.
Forget it. The thing I wanna say is, maybe the universe wasn't telling you stuff today.
Maybe you were telling yourself something.
Telling myself what?
Yeah, tell himself what?
What are you doing here?
I'm a part of this journey.
Don't you dare try to cut me out.
Wow, you look beautiful.
Thanks, Amy.
I'm super nervous.
Kinda wish I was still drunk.
Yeah.
About that... I think we should talk.
Why? [gasps] Are you packing a Bellini?
Look, I spent the whole day denying the fact that there were signs, but I was wrong.
They were actually there.
So far, duh.
The fact that you kept cancelling your own wedding... that was the real sign.
Whoa!
You took the situation, and you flippity-flopped it.
I don't think it was an accident that you got drunk, or that you got everyone else drunk.
What? You think I'm trying to sabotage my own wedding?
I don't know. Were you?
Maybe I was.
I don't know, something just doesn't feel right.
Oh, man, I gotta talk to Adrian.
I was my own sign the whole time?
Wow, that's a real M. Night Shyamalan twist the... oh! [snaps] ""Signs""!
[both gasp]
Wait, do you think he's behind all of this?
I do not.
I should go talk to Rosa.
Thanks, Jake.
Jake, you done good, kid.
Glad I took you along for the ride.
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
All right, give it up for Charles.
Yeah!
[applause]
No, give it up for the devil sticks.
They're the real heroes here.
No, they are not.
No one thinks that. All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?
Oh, I do!
Two Jews walk into a...
No! Sit down!
No, definitely not. Oh!
[soft wedding music plays]
All right, we have an announcement to make.
We're not getting married.
All: Aww!
You can shove those ""awws"" up your butts.
Yeah, or I'll come out there, and I'll do it for ya!
What an interesting event.
I just feel like we were rushing things.
We love each other, but we haven't even really spent that much time together.
We've never even been on a real date, so we're gonna start there.
[applause]
Shut up!
Thank you for the presents. We're keeping them.
All of them.
Yeah, if you got a problem with it, come talk to us in the parking lot.
Also, in just 14 hours Amy put together the most amazing non-wedding wedding in history.
Better than ""Sleepless in Seattle.""
Nope. That is also Nora Ephron.
Kill yourself.
Don't take it personally.
Anyway, we can't let all this go to waste.
Everybody, clear these chairs out of here, and let's get this party started.
No, not the chairs!
Don't touch the chairs, you monsters!
[knock at door]
Yeah?
Oh, I just wanted to thank you for all your help yesterday.
I didn't do much.
It was nothing.
Good day.
What's going on?
I'm just very busy. Get back to work.
Wait. What do you have in there?
A balloon arch.
Oh, my God, Captain.
She is magnificent.
Vindication!

Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to answer and age-old question.
Right, what's Amy's deal? She single?
No, we're dating. Come on.
The question is: Who here does the best impression of Captain Raymond Holt?
You'll be judged on voice, body language, and overall lack of flair.
Everyone will perform the same scenario: Captain Holt eating a marshmallow for the very first time.
Let the Holt-off begin!
What is this glutinous monstrosity before me?
The sugar in this is quite sweet.
Ooh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm-hmm-hmm!
That's your Holt impression?
I can hear him doing that.
Looks like a sticky pillow.
I don't care for it. Classical music.
[laughter]
What's going on here? What are you doing?
Captain, hey, nothing, just eating some marshmallows.
Care for one?
Marshed-mallow.
Hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm! [laughing]
I knew it!
♪ ♪
That concludes our briefing.
And now, on a personal note, I have some thoughts about Beyoncé's ""Lemonade""
I'd like to share.
Oh, my God, sir, as much as I want to hear those thoughts, and it is so, so much, I think we should probably let Amy speak.
Oh, Santiago, the floor is yours.
Thank you. Okay, here's everyone's itineraries for Thanksgiving at my place.
I know a lot of your families are out of town, and you just want to relax, but I think we'll all enjoy ourselves more if we rigidly stick to the schedule.
Whoa, did you assign us individual bathroom break times?
Keep asking questions about it, Sarge, and your slot is after Scully's.
All right, Santiago, damn.
It's your toilet.
Sorry, it's just that my dad is coming into town, and he can be a little uptight.
Uh-oh, Santiago's calling someone uptight.
That can't be good.
He's not crazy. He's just the kind of guy who arranges the money in his wallet according to serial number.
Yeah. That kind of guy.
Boyle, are you set on the turkey?
This year's bird will be as moist as...
Nope.
As juicy as...
Nope.
As wet as you can...
Boyle, just say it'll be good, man.
It'll be good, man.
Well, I gotta go start getting ready.
Don't be late or I'll slit your throats.
[laughs]
You don't have to fake laugh. We know you mean it.
Good.
So, meeting Amy's dad for the first time, huh?
You nervous?
Yeah, a little.
I was talking to Jake.
No, Sarge, I am not nervous.
I'm confident that I'll make a great first impression on Mr. Victor Santiago.
Why'd you do it with a British accent?
I felt like doing the Cuban accent would be a little dicey for me.
Very good call.
Yeah.
My advice: don't be overconfident.
The first time I met Kevin's parents, I called Brahm's ""Funf Gesange"" opus 106 when it is, obviously, opus 104.
They haven't spoken to me since.
Really? Just for that?
Yes... also because they're huge homophobes who think that I made Kevin gay with my magic genitalia.
That's super sad, but I do like hearing you say the word ""genitalia.""
Well, I am ready for this.
I pulled a full Amy and researched the crap out of him.
Made this sweet binder.
Just a couple of factoids about Victor: He's an ex-cop, 65 years old, married for 36 years, Cuban, his favorite food...
Flavor First beefy dog food.
Wait, no, sorry.
That's his dog's favorite food.
His favorite food is... corn.
Makes more sense. Dog food's not in the name.
I know everything about him, therefore I know exactly the type of person I need to be in order for him to think I'm good enough for Amy.
No, Jake, you're fine.
Just flash him your baby browns, he'll love it. Just be yourself.
Be myself? Charles, I have one day to win over Amy's dad. How long did it take before you guys started liking me?
Couple weeks.
Six months.
Jury's still out.
See, Charles?
""Be myself,"" what kind of garbage advice is that?
I hope you're not telling Nikolaj that crap.
[correcting]
Nikolaj.
Ugh.
[classical music playing]
Okay, we're running out of time.
What do you guys like better: classic bishop hat fold or crown fold? Now, the crown is more showy, but the bishop hat has a certain dignity.
I'll kill myself if it's not the crown fold.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Sometimes you have to pretend to care about napkins to stop hearing about napkins.
Sorry I'm late, guys.
Had to get my ax sharpened.
Why do you have an ax? Also, nice ax.
Thank you. It's for the turkey, so I can chop its head off when it gets here.
Chop its head off?
I ordered a live turkey.
It's being delivered. Because you know what they say: The yummiest turkey is the one that just died in your hands.
Charles, you can't kill an animal in here.
That's horrible. It's disgusting.
We won't let you do it, right, Amy?
It's getting late. Don't make a mess.
Relax. It's not the first turkey I've killed in a friend's bathtub.
It isn't?
And now back to the Lexington Thanksgiving Day Dog Show.
Oh, look at her. Sloping, clean-cut, forequarters, cocksure gait.
She's majestic, and she knows it.
Pimento's here.
Ah, Adrian.
So you made it. Happy Thanksgiving.
Is it?
Something wrong?
Feel no pressure to talk about it.
Brass says I can't rejoin the force.
Some crap about you can't just disappear from your job for seven months, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, well, that's unfortunate.
I know how much being a cop meant to you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I guess I could be a teacher.
""Sorry, Travis, the answer's obviously Istanbul. What did you say to me? No, maybe you're wasting your life. Sorry, Principal Ramos, I didn't see you there. Wait, Travis is your son? Hah, well, I guess you're just gonna have to fire me. Fired? Me? How dare you, sir. We will settle..."" See, it just wouldn't work.
Hmm. You know, I had a friend that had to retire from the force.
He became a private investigator.
Ooh, PI, huh?
Mm.
I like that.
[laughs] ""Hello, Mr. Branville, I found out where your wife's been going tonight. Have a seat, you're not gonna like this. She's cheating on you. What do you mean you knew that already? You killed her? And are framing me for the murder? I just left my prints all over the crime scene. Oh, you are an evil ge...""
This... this I could get on board for.
Hmm.
Only problem is, PI license is like, two grand.
I could lend you the money.
Think of it as an investment from someone who believes in you.
Wow, thanks, Captain. That means every...
Whoa, hang on, you carry a check book with you?
'Course, you never know when you're gonna need groceries.
So cool.
[beeping]
Where are you?
Picking up Amy's dad at the airport.
Ooh, that's a strong move.
Have you successfully changed everything about yourself as planned?
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't recognize me.
I'm wearing a sweater, I bought new shoes, I put something on my face called ""moisturizer.""
It's amazing.
Did you clean your car?
I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part: I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.
Who has a favorite font?
The Santiagos do. All of them.
Oh, here he comes. Gotta go, bye.
Hey, Mr. Santiago.
I am Jake Peralta, Amy's boyfriend.
Jake, nice to finally meet you.
You too.
Ah, look at that.
You're a Garamond man, huh?
Of course, what other font would I use, Cambria?
[laughter]
Amy said you were a crack up, but I had no idea.
Oh, it's working.
What?
Excuse me? Shall we?
Let me get your bag.
Sure.
The two hunks have arrived.
Hi.
So glad to have you here, Dad.
Happy to be here, tiger.
How was your flight?
Oh, good, good, you know, I did ""The Times"" crossword.
Oh, great puzzle to do, right?
Oh, my God, 17 down?
Oh, I know, what about 16 across?
What about 34 across?
Oh, what about 45 down?
Both: What about 20 across?
[laughter]
I also did it.
Yeah.
So Jake and I had a great conversation on the way here.
You didn't tell me he was so interested in mutual funds.
Uh...
Yeah, ugh, Amy is so bored of hearing me talk about allocation, asset mix, attribution analysis.
These are just terms I throw around all the time.
In alphabetical order.
Well, that's just how my brain works.
I mean, how would you list financial terms, in random order? What are you, crazy?
He's got a point. I like this guy.
[laughs] Yeah.
Oh! Captain Holt.
This is my dad.
Captain, heard a lot about you.
And I you.
Do you mind passing me those crab puffs?
Oh, certainly. There you go.
Thank you.
Yeah.
That was everything.
Yeah, pretty big night: the three most important men in your life under one roof.
Well, Will Shorts isn't here.
Oh. Burn on Holt... probably.
That's the one you were talking about.
The Cairn Terrier is intelligent and inquisitive with a bold personality.
[chuckles] ""A bold personality.""
We know what that's code for: you're the bitch.
Pimento is back. How's the dog show going?
Well, it's not without its drama.
Whoever groomed the Irish Setter might want to think about blowing his brains out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how's that Wire Fox Terrier?
Still in the lead?
In the lead?
I doubt she even wins her group.
What?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't say that!
What? She's not gonna win?
Ooh, I bet the check you gave me on the Wire Fox Terrier to win.
Why would you do that?
That money was to help you get a PI license.
Yeah, but I wanted to pay you back fast.
You made it sound like the terrier was a sure thing.
You said she was majestic.
They're all majestic.
This is a nationally-televised dog show.
This is the big time.
Listen, mister, I didn't give you that money so you could throw it away. I want it back.
We're gonna pay your bookie a visit.
What?
And so help me God, you better hope I don't miss the ""in memoriam.""
If it's dead dogs you wanna see, I know where to get my hands on dozens of them.
All right, choo-choo!
Here comes the veggie train, leaving the station.
Next stop, a healthy body.
Terry has kids. Just carrots for me.
I don't eat celery, hate the stuff.
Oh, that's funny. Me too.
Really? Get out of town.
Even though everybody says...
both: They're basically the same thing.
[chuckling]
I'm gonna go get a refill. Do you want something?
Oh, uh, you know, if they have it, maybe, like, a dry Riesling?
Excellent choice.
Thank you.
They definitely have it. I brought it.
Wow, you are really pulling this off.
I know, all this research is actually gonna work.
Should I prepare for things all the time?
Yeah.
Nah, that's crazy.
Look, I can't believe you memorized that whole, huge binder.
Oh, I didn't. I brought it with me and hid it out on the stoop.
So do you have a favorite watchmaker?
I do, but I actually have to run to the bathroom real quick.
[seedy music]
Watches...
Gotcha.
I guess if I had to pick one watch, it would be NOMOS Glashutte.
It's a German company based in Saxony.
Speaking of which, I think I just dropped a bit of a Glashutte in the baño.
Steer clear.
The only downside is, I've told him I have to pee so much he thinks I have a UTI.
I wonder if he's ever had a UTI.
You know what, I'm gonna sneak outside and get the 411 on the UTI. BRB.
He loves abbreviations.

Hey, Jake. You looking for this?
What? Oh, no.
Boyle, your turkey's here.
All right, let's do this.
Pretty cool, huh?
I feel like Dexter. I think.
I never actually saw the show.
Billboard gave me nightmares.
Charles, are you crazy?
No, I don't want to watch a living animal die and then consume its flesh.
How is this different than eating a turkey that's been killed in a factory?
Because I don't have to see that.
It's called living in denial, you moron.
Gina, I know it seems cruel, but it's a swift death.
One painless chop removes the head.
I mean, that doesn't sound so bad.
And then its decapitated corpse only flops around for, like, half an hour.
You know what? You won't be able to go through with this if I give this little guy a name.
He's now Nikolaj.
[gasps] That's my son's name.
Go ahead, cut Nikolaj's throat.
Sorry, Gina, but we need a turkey, and you're the only one complaining.
I don't like it either. It's not a fair fight.
Give the bird a gun, then see what happens.
Sarge, this must bother you too.
Yeah, but eating a big drumstick on Thanksgiving makes Terry feel like a king.
Sorry, but it's five against two.
Wait, you assume Hitchcock and I want to eat that turkey?
Yeah...?
Thank you.
Charles, do what you need to do.
Copy that.
Uh-uh, no, hold up.
Rosa, get the bird.
On it.
I'll stand here and sacrifice my life to Charles's bloodlust.
I'm not gonna kill you, Gina.
Huh, then you already lost.
No, where are you going?
Hey, you can run, but you can't hide.
The apartment will run red with the blood of Nikolaj.
Please stop calling him that.
So, uh, what are you doing out here?
Sneaking a cigarette. I just can't quit.
But you knew that, didn't you? Page 136.
What is that strange book you're holding?
I've never seen it before.
""Jake Peralta's Guide to Tricking Amy's Dad.""
What? Who put that there?
Why did I use a title page?
Relax, Jake, it's okay. Actually, I'm quite impressed.
You are?
Yeah, you did a ton of research here. You made a binder.
This is real Santiago stuff.
Yeah, I-I guess it is. I even used tabs.
The good ones.
Yes.
There are good and bad types of tabs.
That's something we all know.
I can't believe you did all this. You've got my family tree, all of my case files, lot of photos.
Yes, and might I add, your ponytail in the 90s puts Amy's to shame.
They used to call me ""The Lion.""
Wow, cool nickname.
They call me ""The Barracuda.""
Well, I call me that. I'm hoping it catches on.
I was wondering what you thought about one of my cases...
First Essex Bank Heist.
Yes, I read that one.
They got robbed the day before their grand opening.
I never solved that one.
That bothered me for 20 years.
But I see that you wrote a note here that says, ""Contractor did it, so obvious.""
Oh, what?
Well, you know us millennials, we're always exaggerating.
But what I think happened there is, is that I was reading that file, and I noticed that the contractor, Russo, was the, um...
Obvious?
Obvious suspect, but only in the sense that he was the only one who could've possibly done it 'cause he had the blueprint.
I talked to Russo. He had an alibi.
Of course, of course.
But, you know, the name of the company was ""Russo and Sons,"" so... I figure probably, maybe, definitely the sons did it.
Maybe. Probably. For sure.
Sons? Oh, my God, the sons.
I think you might be on to something.
Really?
I don't know how I missed that.
I bet they still live here in New York.
We should go talk to them right now.
I mean, if that would be okay.
""Okay,"" are you kidding me?
I would love to work a case with you.
That's amazing.
Looks like The Lion is gonna roar again.
And the Barracuda is gonna...
What?
[fluttering]
Anyway, you get it, let's go.
[knocking]
Your bookie lives in a college dorm?
He's a freshman. They don't let them live off-campus first year. Doi.
Hey, Adrian, come on in. Happy Thanksgiving, man.
Can it, Alan.
Listen, I need the money back, and I need it back now.
Aw, geez, I'm sorry.
I can't do that. I placed the bet online.
It's not like I can cancel it.
You just placed the bet online?
Yeah. He could've done it himself.
It's really easy.
I kept telling him there's no need for bookies anymore.
No, no, no, I don't mess with computers, okay?
Ever since I died of dysentery on the Oregon Trail, I was like, no thank you. I'm done with this.
Okay, look, the money's already in the Caribbean.
There's nothing I can do.
Looks like we're going to the Caribbean.
[imitates guitar riff]
You do know we're not going to the Caribbean, right?
I didn't know that. That is a bummer.
[grunts] Come on, guys.
It's getting late. Open the door.
Not until you promise to let this little turkey live out the rest of his life with Rosa.
What? Why can't it live with you?
I'm an ideas man.
All right, that's it. You've left me no choice.
[exciting music]
There we go.
Thanks.
Now give us the bird.
Gladly. Whoop, whoop...
Not that bird.
Don't take another step.
This ends now.
I am so sorry, girl.
Great party, but uh-uh.
All right, here it is.
Be free, noble bird.
Be free, fly away. Fly to freedom.
Gina, turkeys can't fly.
[""Jaws"" theme]
[gasps]
Why is he looking at me like that?
[chattering]
Nobody make any sudden moves.
Yeah, and those talons are super sharp, huh?
That thing's a freaking dinosaur.
[all screaming]
[dramatic music]
[thud]
[turkey squawks]
So, where were you the day the bank was robbed?
I don't understand, Dad. What's going on?
Well, honey, this man...
The Barracuda.
Wants to talk to me about something that happened 20 years ago, and as I said to that man...
The Lion.
[hisses]
20 years ago, I was in Pittsburgh at a softball tournament.
Oh, Pittsburgh, interesting.
Home of the Bengals.
Home of the Steelers.
No, this is the home of the stealers.
I set you up perfectly for that.
While you were busy establishing an alibi, your sons were back in Brooklyn robbing the bank.
But we were at the softball tournament too.
Oh, convenient you say that now when you have no proof.
Didn't you guys bring back a trophy?
A trophy's not really proof.
We also have a framed photograph of the team, a videotape of the whole event, 39 eye-witnesses, a newspaper article about it, and security footage from the gas stations we stopped at on the way to and from Pittsburgh.
Okay, I gotta say, it seems a little weird you're so prepared for these questions.
No, it's not.
My brother and I had to gather all that information 20 years ago when we got accused of the exact same stuff by him.
Say what now?
Captain, you seem upset.
Are you mad at me about something?
Yes, obviously. I gave you $2,000, and you threw it away.
Ugh, I knew that was it. Stupid, Adrian, stupid!
And it's not just the money.
I know... you believed in me.
And I took that belief, and I just dumped all over it.
Wait, Adrian, an SMS text alert.
Just pulled my pants down and squatted all...
Adrian, be quiet.
The beagle's been eliminated.
Our dog is in the top three!
[wheezing]
Put the dog show on, at once.
The game's on.
Put on the dog show, Hank!
It's in overtime.
So what was that? You set me up?
You already knew they had an alibi.
Of course I did. I guess I guess you must have missed that fact when you were putting together your sloppy, lazy, garbage binder.
What? I thought you loved my binder.
You said I used all the good tabs.
Those tabs weren't even cascading.
Okay. Oh, I see.
I think I know what's happening here.
You're upset because Amy and I have seen each other's butts.
What?
Oh, God, it wasn't that.
Please forget I said anything about your daughter's butt.
You know why I don't like you, Jake?
'Cause of my binder, apparently.
No.
Because of my binder.
What, you think I wouldn't do my own research, find out everything I could about whoever my daughter is dating?
Okay, fine, but it's not like you found anything bad about me.
I mean, look at this credit score: 100.
Out of 850.
Oh, no, really?
This binder tells the story of a sloppy, disorganized, irresponsible individual who's not allowed within 500 feet of Taylor Swift.
That was a misunderstanding.
You're not good enough for my Amy.
I don't want my only daughter dating a screw-up.
Oh, yeah? Well, I don't want my only girlfriend daughtering a jerk-dad.
Burn on you.
[phone buzzing]
It's Amy.
Can I answer it? Am I good enough to have a conversation with her?
Honestly, no.
Well, I don't care. I'm doing it anyway.
Hello, lover. How's that butt?
What? Are you with my dad?
I sure am, and you're on speaker phone.
So feel free to tell me all about your sexuality and the intercourse we might have together, getting it in.
I was just calling to tell you there's a turkey loose in the apartment, but somehow that's not the weirdest part of this phone call.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing. Just had a real eye-opening conversation with your dad.
I wanted his approval, but he says I'll never be good enough for you.
What the hell?
I know, right?
Tell him he's wrong.
No, I'm upset with you.
That's right, go get 'em, tiger.
I'm also upset with you. What is this, 1950?
I can't date someone unless I have my father's approval?
Oh, obviously you can...
You guys act like this is your decision to make, like, the woman doesn't even exist in this equation. Well, this woman...
Wait, Amy, shut up.
Excuse me?
I mean, I'm so sorry, you were making a totally valid point about gender equality, but I just thought of something really important so I'm gonna hang up on you, okay?
Love you, bye.
It wasn't Russo or his sons.
Both: It was the daughter!
[dramatic music]
[chattering]
All right, someone's gotta go out there and kill that feathery b*st*rd.
Rosa, you're always looking for an excuse to behead something.
Don't look at me.
Terry wastes all that time building muscles, make him do it.
Oh, come on, you all know these are just for show. Gina's the one who set him free.
How was I supposed to know there'd be consequences for my actions?
Enough.
I started this.
I'm gonna end it.

Those chuckleheads from the Nine-Five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
Okay. Which case of yours was on the news?
Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
[ska music playing]
Looking back, I have no regrets.
You should.
Yup.
So why are the Nine-Five on the news?
They're investigating death threats against some author named DC Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
DC Parlov? Did you say DC Parlov?
What is happening?
DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
""The Skyfire Cycle!""
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the Sepsidians and...
Oh, so it's like a ""Game of Thrones"" type thing?
No, ""Game of Thrones"" is a ""Skyfire"" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
Yeah, come on, Boyle.
I'm so sorry, guys.
When I was a little kid, I spent hours reading those books.
Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote DC Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
I hope it's not a severed head.
""The Skyfire Cycle: Sand Into Glass: The Reckoning of Ka'Lar.""
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
""Terry, you do have friends.
Oh, boy.
""You have me. Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories. Parlov.""
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
Yeah, Little Terry got buff-a!
Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, Little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
[laughs]
Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case. Terry's gonna meet his hero.
Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
[whispering] Marie Callender was a real bitch.
Oh, check it out. Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in Butt Thumb, Iowa?
No, it's pronounced ""Beaut-Hume,""
And Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan. I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
Aruba? [laughs]
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers. We're burrowers.
Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure. Come to Aruba.
Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa. We've already rented the tent.
""Tent"" singular?
Charles, ""tent"" singular?
Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
And now it's a scene.
It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
It's not personal. It's a math problem.
Oh, Mama.
Pass.
Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
It's the ""Monty Hall problem."" Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door. The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door. Should you do it?
No.
Yes.
Both: It's simple math.
It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
Kevin is right.
Hmm.
You're fired.
What?
Ah!
Hey, Sarge, great news.
The guys at the Nine-Five gave us the DC Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
Give it back.
You're welcome.
Wait, what?
This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
Oh, I see. You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it. One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed. I worked up my courage, I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
""Hey.""
That's it?
It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
[laughs] Give him the benefit of the doubt, Sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good Lord! Keep fanning them!
Keep fanning them!
Oh.
Mr. Parlov. Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
Well, thank you very much. I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
Quite the opposite. The top brass just wanted New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
[chuckles] Sarge?
[meek voice] Hi.
Uh-oh. Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
[chuckles]
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting. Any idea who might be sending them?
Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, Did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
Qwandor is not a sexual being.
For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
""Skyfire"" fan?
Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
Uh, he's not a killer. [laughs]
Tell him about the inscription.
You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago, I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription, ""We all write our own stories,"" and it changed my life.
I do remember you.
You do?
I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the Cloud Rock says...
both: ""You found yourself in your struggle.""
Wow.
Both: ""The truth is what you came for, and you found it within your strife.""
Well, that was cool.
Both: ""Be brave for Tolgan.""
There's more.
Both: ""Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan.""
""Tolgan.""
Is it over?
Yes. This is the best day of my life.
You have three kids, Terry.
I said what I said!
All right.
[laughs]
Cousin Sam!
Chucky!
Up high.
Down low.
Both: Butts! Butts! Butts!
Oh, man, I love this shirt. Where'd you get that?
Oh.
Both: Mervyn's.
Oh.
[both laughing]
Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
Oh, already did. She took me out for dinner.
Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite... egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
both: Hard boiled egg on the side.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
N... I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
In what universe?
I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
Ew.
Sorry, vote's in.
13-2, Iowa.
For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
Yeah.
Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
[groans] I'm scared! Just kidding. Come on, Sam.
Sam, stay.
Sam, come. [whistles]
Sam, stay.
Come on, Sam.
Sam, stay.
Come on.
Come on.
Stay.
Come.
[clicks tongue] Stay.
All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
Great. Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book, ""The Skyfire Cycle: A Bridge to Jarcata.""
Ah, ah. It's actually pronounced ""Jarca-a.""
All the T's in ""Skyfire"" are silent.
This book sounds impossible to read.
[laughs] I know, right?
Okay. All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local. They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of ""Die Hard.""
There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh! We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
Ooh, ""smorf.""
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
No. No, we're not.
[Bone Crusher's ""Never Scared""]
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ So I'm outside of da club ♪
♪ And you think I'm a punk ♪



Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
Good evening, sir.
No, it's not. I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics.
[sighs]
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to Captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
'Cause you called it ""funky cats and their feisty stats.""
That was the name! It was so cool.
It was not. Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
What? Gross! Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...[chuckles] That's not what I think.
Captain Dad is just my boss.
Wow.
Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here. I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
Oh, my God, I hate these books.
Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
Yup, that's us. Dragons have dongs.
You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism. I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon ""petish.""
Okay.
""Petish"" handeth yon'd.
This is a start, but if you really want Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy. [grunts]
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
Oh, yeah.
""A message in blood"" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed Prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
No. She hates it.
Yeah, makes sense.
Uh, This writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
Why not?
Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats. He sent them to himself.
Terry did not see that coming.
And that is a perfect match.
This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
For publicity? I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
He pulls, Jake. He pulls.
Ugh. Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
You said that went great.
I lied. It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake Per...
Oh, no!
Wha...
Hey!
You're my favorite player.
You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
It doesn't? Oh, my God, why did I share that story?
There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
Whatever you need.
Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support. It really means a lot to me.
[sighs, blows raspberries]
Is everything okay, Santiago?
No, I lost my ring.
Did you see where it went?
Actually... it's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
Are you trying to Monty Hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty Hall ruining my place of work when Monty Hall has already ruined my home life.
Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
[chuckles nervously]
What did you say?
Don't say it again.
I said you two need to bone.
[whimpers]
How... dare you, Detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
[shouting] Bone!
[sternly] What happens in my bedroom, Detective, is none of your business.
[shouting] Bone?!
[calmly] Don't ever speak to me like that again.
Why did you do that?
Dude was pent up. Now he knows.
Problem solved.
The council of the cousins.
Look at them. It's like a Beige of Pigs.
Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
That's a pun? On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated in front of your family.
Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of Don Boyle? I changed his diapers.
And I'm about to change yours.
Ugh.
Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, Bill, Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
Papa Boyle once said: ""Stay in the middle. That's where it's safe. That's where we thrive. That's... Iowa.""
Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this: one long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
Do we really wanna go where ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" took place?
Yes!
[cheers and applause]
No!
That movie gave us nightmares for months!
[crowd groans]
Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh! Size 7s for everybody.
In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
I love you.
All: I love you.
I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
[laughs] I love you.
All: I love you.
I love you too.
You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
I love you.
All: I love you.
[knocking at the door]
Hey.
What's up guys? Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
Oh, really? What are they, like, some nerdy sci-fi fans, or...
Good Lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
I told you, man, he pulls. He Pu-u-ulls.
Okay, stop saying ""pulls.""
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
We should just go.
Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
Yeah, tell you the truth, I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
Both: What?
Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on. That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
But you said you remembered me.
Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund Grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
Yeah, that's a cool story.
After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
It was kind of hot...
Please stop talking.
Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
Enjoy having s*x with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
[pages rip]
Yep yep. That works, too.
Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
I don't feel like kicking down doors.
What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
Like a cartoon?
Mm-hmm.
No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
Look, Sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pantsed.
How many Knicks have you pantsed?
Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
That's my soap.
I got it at Lush.
You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it. I'll just look it up online.
Okay, we're both here, Sam. Go ahead.
Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
[both gasp quietly]
All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles. I love you, Gina.
Whoops. Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the Temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
Yes, you are.
What? Why are you smiling?
I don't get it. I won.
Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
Yeah, so I could win.
And you did win... a plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
""Grave"" singular?
Charles, ""grave"" singular?
Oh, Captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty Hall, but I did contact a math...
No need, Santiago. It's all good.
So the fight with Kevin is over?
Yep.
Because you understand the math now?
Nope.
Because you guys...
Yep.
Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had s*x.
Okay, Rosa.
[knock at door]
Edmund Grail?
Who wants to know?
NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about DC Parlov.
Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
[faint clattering]
Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
[grunts]
Taste the might of Ka'Lar!
Get him out of here.
Nice work, Sarge.
You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry Chronicles.
Book One: The Arrest of Edmund Grail.
Followed by Book Two: The Ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
I couldn't let you down.
And that is why you are my hero.
Come on. Bring it in, big fella.
Oop... [grunts]
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!

Hey there, Boyle. How was your weekend?
Well, actually I got a little sick.
Oh, really? I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Yeah, ""Bullets over Broadway"" was on TV.
And I came down with a big ol' Dianne Wiest infection.
Like ""yeast.""
♪ ♪
So I'll coordinate with the transit cops while you follow up with the DA's off... Uh, can I help you, Captain Stentley?
Oh, hey, uh, did you guys see a black backpack sitting around anywhere?
I did not.
No.
Aww, shoot, this is turning out to be a real cluster-biff.
Why? What's in the backpack?
Uh, just some evidence. Do you guys know a drug dealer named Flaco?
Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn.
Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...
I'm not good with sizes... and a cell phone.
And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.
I do now. That's a great theory!
Whoa. But the bag is missing, so...
Hey, how big of a deal is it if I, um, if I never find it?
I'd say it's a very...
Ah-uh-uh-uh.
Sugarcoat it for me.
Okay, um, no biggie.
Ahh, that is great news. Thank you so much.
Hey, if you see something, say something.
Oh, that is catchy, huh? It's like, I just made up a hit song.
Nope, very common police expression.
♪ If you see somethin' ♪
♪ Say somethin', come on and party tonight ♪
[firing noise]
[laughs]
This is our chance. If C.J. can't find that evidence, he could be fired. This could be our way back onto the day shift.
♪ Come on and party tonight ♪
Wow! It's actually a really catchy song.
There's nothing to celebrate.
Captain Stentley is going to find that evidence because we're gonna help him.
What? No, this is our chance to undermine him. Come on and party tonight.
Peralta, we're police officers.
We have a duty to protect this city.
We took an oath, a sacred oath. What if those drugs end up on the street or a dangerous criminal is set free because of missing evidence?
[sighs]
Okay, you know, you're trying to say it's whatever because you just... [indistinct].
You're fumfering.
Of course I'm fumfering.
Fine, we'll find the bag. Come on and party tonight.
Damn it.
Hey, guys, department has a new green initiative.
We have to reduce energy usage by 15%.
That means no more laminating, Santiago.
Oh, that's fine. It's not the thing that gives me the most pleasure in life.
Interacting with other people, that's what gets me going.
Scully, Hitchcock, lose the chocolate fountain.
What are we supposed to dip our strawberries in?
Our nacho cheese fountain? That's crazy.
Unless...
Sarge, you beautiful b*st*rd.
Get rid of 'em.
And, Gina, you can't run that space heater 24/7 anymore.
Space heater? Excuse me, this is a Fornax Radiant Comfort System, and her name is Jacinta.
Okay, well, Jacinta's gotta go.
He didn't mean that, darling.
Seriously, turn off the space heater.
No.
Do it, now. That's an order.
Yeah, well, you don't wanna start a battle of the wills with Gina Linetti because you will emerge from that battle a broken man.
Not to brag, but I was name-checked in my kindergarten teacher's suicide note.
Oh, my God.
Any luck finding the missing backpack?
No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser.
I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing.
Mm.
Why are you helping this guy, sir? He's the opposite of everything you stand for. His favorite expression is ""that's gonna leave a mark.""
And he doesn't even use it right.
Whoo, that soup is good. That's gonna leave a mark.
What?
Well, he's not our best, but I won't be part of any sneaky subterfuge designed to undermine him.
You think you're so great just 'cause you always do what's good and right. Well, I've got news for you: ya boring.
You know who else was called ""boring""? Andreas Marggraf.
And you know what he did?
He discovered zinc, because you've used that one on me before because, uh, ya boring.
Well, if I'm so boring, how come I have a lead?
Come take a look at this. This is security footage from the day the backpack went missing.
11:00 a.m., the bag's over a chair.
Now let's fast forward and see what happened to it.
Wait, that was two hours? Where's C.J. during all this?
♪ You have the right to remain silent ♪
♪ Come on and party tonight ♪
♪ Party tonight ♪
The guy's got good hooks. I mean, right?
Wait, who's this guy? Flaco must've sent someone to get the backpack, and they just waltzed right in and took it out of the precinct. Oh, C.J. is in so much trouble.
You think that disapproving glare works on me after all the times I've seen it?
Step it up, find something new, ya boring.
'Ello, me lady. It's your matey lil' Charlie Boyle, innit, love?
Ugh, it's 2:00 a.m., and we're working. How can you be so happy?
Because I figured out the secret of surviving the night shift.
You see, this little piggy went to the warehouse.
This little piggy went with him. This little piggy was like...
Stop, just stop and say whatever you are saying another way.
I found a 24 hour foot massage parlor, and it's amazing.
It's the best experience you've ever had.
You're just like, mmm...
[splash]
Ahh, wha?
Wouldn't stop making that noise, man.
Let me take you, let me show you the greatest and only pleasure of the night shift.
Pass, I'd rather die than have a stranger touch my bare feet.
I'm telling you, once they get get their strong fingers in your toe gaps, it's just mmm...
[whack]
[grunts]
Uh, that's on me, shouldn't have had my eyes closed.
[exhales]
Hey, C.J., you upset about something, man? Maybe something in your career?
Yeah, I told the brass that I lost the bag and I screwed up the whole Flaco case, and you were wrong, it was a biggie.
Yeah, well, you told me to sugarcoat it.
And whose fault it that, Jake?
Yours.
I know.
Okay, so what happened?
I mean, they couldn't have fired you, right?
That'd be crazy. I mean, they could, for sure, they had every reason to, but did they?
Did they fire you?
Worse.
They're pulling my transfer.
What transfer, what now?
Oh, I've just been feeling overwhelmed with this job, and I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm a little in over my head.
Completely unqualified, yeah.
It is so cool that you get me.
Yeah.
Anyway, I heard that they were hiring a head administrator at the Police Academy, so I put in for it.
Wait, you wanna train other officers?
Well, the nine years at the academy were some of the best years of my life.
That's a six-month program.
Sure, for a lot of people.
Anyway, they said that the job was mine, and now they're pissed, so it looks like I'm stuck here forever.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All is not lost. We can still fix this.
So, sure, maybe you can't get back the backpack, but you could do something even better.
Like, what if you single-handedly figure out who Flaco is and then you take him down.
Oh, come on, Jake.
I'll just screw it up like I screw up everything else.
No, you won't, because I will be there to help you, but don't worry, you'll still get all the credit.
Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna get you the hell out of here.
Are you sugarcoating this for me?
I most certainly am not.
Whoo, that's gonna leave a mark.
Ahh.
So, Captain, I've been thinking about this whole missing backpack thing, and what if we find Flaco and take him down?
Oh, are you trying to solve C.J.'s case behind his back to embarrass him?
No, not at all. In fact, I think C.J. should come along. I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know?
The sacred oath I took. Your speech really inspired me.
Well, it was one of my better ones.
Felt really good as I was saying it.
Yeah.
So what's the plan, son?
Well, Dad, we don't know where Flaco is, but I have a C.I. who says he's got an agreement with Marco Severino.
So you think we should pose as drug dealers looking for a new heroin supplier and get Severino to hook us up with Flaco. And you think C.J. can handle this mission.
I know he's inexperienced, but he's a creative guy.
I think he'd be great undercover.
Okay, muchachos, let's roll up on these muchachos.
Great start, and I love your double use of ""muchachos.""
Hey, it's C.J., by the way.
[machine whirring]
Oooh, that's a nice lam job.
This one goes on the blog.
[shutter clicks]
[clears throat]
Hey, Sarge, what up, bro?
""What up, bro?"" You're laminating in here, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
I just love it so much.
It's okay, I'm used to it. No one listens to me.
I'm a lousy sergeant.
What? No, don't say that.
Why would you say that?
If I tell you something, you promise not to tell anyone else?
Of course.
You know how I took the lieutenant's exam last week?
Uh-huh.
I just found out I didn't pass.
Oh, no, but you shouldn't feel bad, only like 10% of people pass on the first try.
I know, and I'm all exhausted because of the night shift, plus my bathroom break during the test took a little longer than anticipated.
May I use the restroom, please?
[creak]
Uh-oh, nothing to see here.
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Little desk.
That's why they say ""it's test time, so diaper up.""
They say that, I've never said that.
I've never worn a diaper during test. Who would wear a diaper during a test? That's ridiculous, I mean...
Santiago.
Sorry, look, don't give up on the green initiative. You're a great sergeant.
You'll get everyone on board.
Not Gina.
Yes, Gina. You can handle her. You can do this.
Sarge, it's test time.
Diaper up.
Thank you for coming along with me on this manhunt.
I needed your help.
No problem, who are we looking for?
He's a one-armed smuggler from the dunes of Tunisia. He goes by the name of Señor Riff Raff.
You're taking me to that foot massage place.
I am taking you to the foot massage place. I made that whole thing up.
Shocking.
Look, the night shift hasn't been easy on any of us.
Let me make it slightly better by paying a strong-handed woman to literally milk the stress from your feet.
Just shut up, I'll do it once.
[gasps]
Yes!
As long as you promise to never ever talk about foot milk again.
Deal, you're gonna love it.
I guarantee you, I won't.
Both: Mmm.
All right, that's Severino's restaurant.
My C.I. says he's in there.
Whoo, I'm pumped. I'm ready.
Um, just out of curiosity, how... how scared are you guys?
Not at all. How about you?
I'm terrified, but, you know, I just keep telling myself, worst comes to worst, just start shooting things, you know?
I think it might be better if you stayed in the van.
Wait, are you trying to sideline me?
Yes.
Oh, thank God.
[laughs]
But just because you're in the van doesn't mean you're not an important part of the mission. Your job will be to keep an eye on the restaurant.
And, if anybody suspicious walks in, you just...
Run everybody over with the van and then back up if they're still moving.
Don't try and guess where I'm going with it.
You keep an eye on the door. If anyone suspicious walks in, let us know in our ear pieces.
Oh, I could do that, absolutely. You know, actually I saw those ear pieces on ""Ellen."" One time, Justin Bieber was on, and he was supposed to be, like, a security guard, only...
C.J., I'm loving the story, but we gotta go in.
I'll finish later.
TBC.
Thanks for hand-laminating, Santiago.
Of course, if you ask me, saving energy is trending.
Oh, Gina, didn't see you there.
Gina, did you shut off your space heater yet?
Space heater...
Doesn't ring any bells.
Jacinta.
Oh, no, she's still going strong.
I will take that thing away from you by force, if necessary.
Well, come and get it.
Seriously?
The heater's under your skirt?
Maybe. You can't prove that.
Yeah, I can. There's a cord running under it, and I think you may be on fire.
Mm, so?
What do you mean ""so""?
I'm not giving up Jacinta.
You are on fire, Gina. You do not have the upper hand in this situation.
I always have the upper hand.
Not when there's flames shooting out of your butt!
Especially when there's flames shooting out of my butt.
[smoke detector beeping]
Damn it.
[hissing]
How the hell did I lose that one?



Hey, you Severino?
Who wants to know?
I'm Cal, this is Billy. We used to buy from Rosario, but he got busted by the feds, and we're looking for a new hookup.
Guys, we got company.
There's a lady with a dog, and a man with a ponytail.
Another lady with a dog, two dogs back to back, guys.
Is that fishy?
I knew Rosario.
Seems fishy to me...
So how's come...
There's a lot of dogs out...
I never heard of you?
Well, you can ask Rosario's guys about us.
They're right on top of each other.
If you think it's weird, just cough once for yes, twice for no.
I didn't come here to be accused of something. We can buy from somebody else.
Jake, I need an answer, why is nobody coughing?
[stammering] Hold up, I got a right to know who I might be in business with.
I need an answer on the dog thing, is it weird? Can somebody cough?
[coughs]
Whose cough was that? Was that you, Jake?
If it was you, cough twice, if it was somebody else,
cough three times.
[coughs]
Sorry, bad allergy day, pollen count is off the charts.
Pollen count, oh, man, how do you come up with that stuff?
So what's your territory?
But that's why you guys are in there, and I'm out here.
We don't sell on the streets.
We have loyal buyers that come to us.
On the mic, you know...
And we need quality product, our customers are discerning.
Check one, check two, check, check, DJ C.J. on the mic.
I got a guy that could get you the best dope in the city.
You know, I actually did DJ
my sister's wedding.
But it ain't gonna be cheap.
It did not turn out well. Apparently, there's such a thing as too much Smash Mouth.
I'm sorry, you think we wanna deal with complete strangers?
God, sometimes I look at my sister, and I'm like...
I mean, we gotta cover our own asses.
She's got two kids, beautiful house, and I'm like...
How do we know this guy's even legit?
C.J., what have you done with your life?
Shut up!
Stop talking!
Ahh!
Shut up, now!
Oh, my God.
Shut up, C.J.
Oh, whoa, whoa, what are you, cops?
Yes, obviously we're cops. Put your hands up.
Whoa, who said we were cops? We haven't gotten any information we needed yet. Jake, you're blowing it, man.
Stop talking!
Crime scene investigators combed every inch of Severino's restaurant, no drugs.
Well, we can't hold him much longer, and he's not talking.
The interrogation did not exactly go well.
You're gonna tell us who Flaco is, and you're gonna tell us right now.
[crash]
Oh, that was crazy.
Well, there's one bit of good news.
The last call on Severino's phone was to a contact we believe to be Flaco. We've tracked his location to a warehouse by the water. We're gonna storm the place.
Great, I'll go get C.J.
Why? Why are you so determined to make him a part of this?
No reason.
If you actually cared about your sacred oath, you'd see that he's a risk to the case.
[laughs]
Oh, my speech didn't actually inspire you, did it?
Ugh, all right, here's the truth.
If we catch Flaco, and C.J. gets credit for it, he's gonna transfer out of the Nine-Nine.
That's what this is all about? You're still trying to undermine the man?
What? No!
The opposite, if anything. I want to see him succeed.
I'm trying to overmine him.
Oh, you know I hate it when you make up words, Peralta.
Are you still mad at me for saying ""snaccident""?
Yes, very.
Please, just let him come along.
No.
Just so his name is on the arrest report.
No.
I'll put him in a car a block away.
Fine. At least tell me what it was about my speech that didn't work for you.
[sighs] Oh, man, if I had to boil it down to one thing and really pinpoint it, I guess I would just say it's, uh, ya boring.
But still let him come? Great.
[hissing]
What is all this?
Oh, hey, Sarge. I'm growing tropical plants now in the warmth of my three space heaters.
It's getting a little hot though, wouldn't you say?
[hissing]
Ugh, oh, yeah.
Probably also turn on my portable air conditioning unit.
Boop.
You're not gonna beat me, Gina. This is my last stand.
My whole life is last stands.
Gina, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, what's up?
Let me guess, you and Jake are having problems; you want me to teach you how to kiss?
What? No, stop that.
Oh.
I know how I kiss, I've read books.
This is about Terry. You can't tell anyone else this, but...
He failed his lieutenant's exam.
How do you know that?
Let's just say my little birds are everywhere collecting whispers.
He left the letter on his desk, and I read it.
Okay, but if you know he's depressed, then why are you being so hard on him?
Don't worry, I got this. Just clear the lane and let Gina do her thing.
What? Ugh.
[rattling]
Gina? You locked me in.
Going to lunch.
Gina, you know I'm very claustrophobic.
Everybody ready? Where's C.J.?
Parked a block away on Winthrop, as promised.
Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.
I downloaded an app on his phone that makes your words sound like burps.
Smart, really smart.
Yeah.
Here we go, on three, two, one.
[crash]
NYPD, on the ground.
On the ground!
Flaco, run!
That's Flaco.

[smack]
[grunts]
Oh, sorry.
C.J., that's Flaco.
You got him.
Yeah!
He's out cold, how'd you do it?
No, no, wait. Let me guess.
You opened your car door into him.
Yep.
He never saw it coming.
Yep.
And neither did you.
It was a total accident; you were getting out of your car to go pee.
No!
There was a spider in the car, and I panicked.
Damn it, how did I not guess that?
You gotta see this spider. It's gigantic.
[bubbling]
Charles, this is amazing.
I know, when's the last time you cried like that?
Huh? You cried?
Damn right, I did.
Oh, guess we gotta get back to the Nine-Nine.
Let's not be hasty. Neither of us have any open cases right now, so should we tell the ladies we're ready for round two?
Let's do it, you insatiable little minx.
I'll go get 'em.
Mmm.
[dramatic music]
[whirring]
Charles, this place is a front, money laundering or something.
We gotta get out of here right now.
I just got off the phone with One Police Plaza. They're thrilled.
Captain Stentley, you got your transfer.
Whoo!
I'm not transferring.
What, why?
The whole reason I wanted to transfer in the first place is because I didn't feel like I could do this job, but the mission tonight, me taking down Flaco...
More the door than you.
It just showed me that I can do this, and now I feel like I really do belong here.
So thank you, guys, for... for making me believe in myself again.
Oh.
Come here.
That's gonna leave a mark.
I can't believe this.
Not only are we still stuck on the night shift, but now we have to watch C.J. get a medal.
Why are there so many reporters? Even ""The Times"" is here.
Wait, really? Who'd they send?
Wilson, Palmer, Schneier, Levine, Rogers, Tyler, Baker, Correal, Bromwich, Robbins, Schmidt?
Stop saying reporters' names. How do you know so many names?
They're the only real rock stars we have left.
Okay.
Hello, we're here today to honor Captain Jason Stentley, who single-handedly brought down a major drug ring.
[applause]
And so it is my pleasure to bestow upon him the Medal of Honor. Captain Stentley.
Oh, bestow me, baby.
Ahh, wow, that's a lot of people. Uh...
Baba Booey, Cornholio.
[laughs]
That's it for my prepared remarks.
Any questions?
Will taking down one drug dealer make a big difference in the overall level of drugs moving into the city?
No idea, next?
What's your philosophy for dealing with international narcotic supply chains?
Didn't understand the question, next.
Why was Flaco targeted for this operation?
Okay, there's a question I can answer.
Well, it all started because I lost a huge bag of cocaine, so I totally biffed it, you know, but...
Thank you, thank you, Captain.
Oh, oh.
That... That is... That's plenty.
That was a train wreck.
Yes, he never should have been put in that position.
Whoever recommended him for the medal and called all those reporters really messed up.
Wait, what are you saying?
Oh, nothing.
It just seems as if C.J. has been... overmined.
You did this?
I did.
And you used my made-up word.
I hated it, ""overmined.""
What have I become? Was this whole thing even worth it?
It was no snaccident.
So the foot massage place reported $7 million in profit last year. To make that much, they'd have to massage 100 feet an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the entire year.
Damn it, we have to shut them down.
Wait. Let's not be hasty about this.
Let's think this through. We wanna be smart about this.
Right, I mean, what if we bust them tonight, and then tomorrow I'm chasing a murderer, and I'm about to get him, and my foot cramps up?
Due to lack of massaging.
And then the murderer gets away.
Know who he kills next?
The mayor.
Oh, my God, the city has no mayor now.
It's chaos.
Rioting, looting, panic in the streets.
They gotta call in the National Guard, there's tanks rolling down 5th Avenue, declaring martial law.
It's insane. All because we shut down the foot massage place...
That was doing God's work.
What were we thinking.
So it's agreed: we let them stay open for the sake of the city.
For the sake of the city.
We have to do our stupid jobs, don't we?
Yeah, let me get my stupid gun.
NYPD, get down on the comfortable matted floor.
Put your magical hands where we can see them.
You're under arrest for ruining something perfect.
And money laundering.
Yes, money laundering, whatever.
Gina, I've been thinking a lot about how you refuse to give up Jacinta.
That's right.
She's never leaving.
I know, which is why I decided to do the only fair thing.
Space heaters for everyone.
So what? That sounds great.
Everyone.
Whoo-whee, it's toasty in here.
You're gonna be looking at that all night long.
Whoop, I think he's about to eat a hoagie. Is that mayonnaise or sweat?
Ugh, fine, I give up. You can take Jacinta.
Really? And the other two space heaters, too?
[sighs] All of them, you win.
I win? I won.
Amy, I won!
You did it, Sarge.
You're gonna get our power usage down.
I don't care about that crap. I took down Gina Linetti.
I did the impossible. Terry is back on top.
Diaper up! What!
Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Jason Stentley has been transferred from active duty effective immediately. Captain Raymond Holt will be taking his place, and, yes, he's taking all of us with him.

I don't understand. Where's the tree?
It was inside us all along. Brilliant, Jake.
No, Charles, not everything was inside of us all along.

Cool. Can we go now?
Obviously not. Behold, the greatest inflatable tree that 'Murica has to offer.

It's a very difficult toy to get in America, so I was worried when Charles told Nikolaj he would get him one.
I said, keep it a surprise, so you don't build up his expectations, but Charles said, ""No way, I want to build expectations.""

Guys, personally, I think we should go out there and just sing our best.
Caroling isn't about competing.
It's about having fun together.
Well, now that you put it that way, Scully, it makes me realize Rosa and Terry are right.
I say we quit the competition and hurl projectiles at the MTA.

(UPBEAT MUSIC)
Oh, love the shirt, Jake.
Lilith Fair '98 had the best lineup.
Meshell Ndegeocello crushed it that year.
Thank you, Boyle, but this is not my shirt.
I slept at Amy's and I spilled ranch dressing on mine.
Don't you have a drawer full of clothes at her place by this point?
Yeah, I spilled ranch dressing all over the drawer.
What's so hard to understand about this, guys?
Why don't you two move in together already?
I thought you were planning to.
We are. We just haven't decided whose apartment we're going to live in.
I think Jake should move into mine, because it's bigger, nicer, and isn't covered in black mold.
Black mold, Amy? Not cool.
Right, Terry?
What?
I rest my case. Besides, my place is cheaper and it's in a cooler neighborhood.
Yeah. That neighborhood is technically called Cobblestink.
All right, everyone. Listen up.
We have a situation. Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street.
It was carrying nine convicts who are now at large.
It's our job to bring them in.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a manhunt.
(GASPS) A manhunt.
Okay, what I want from each and every one of you is a hard-target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in the area.
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.
There must be some sort of error.
There are nine fugitives, and none of them are named Kimble.
I didn't kill my wife!
What?
You're supposed to go, ""I don't care!""
I don't care.
Let the manhunt begin.
Patrol officers have secured a ten-block perimeter.
All civilians are being evacuated.
Here's what the convicts were in for: arson, kidnapping, racketeering, assault and battery, forgery and counterfeiting, triple homicide.
Whoo!
What? I'm not excited about the murders.
I'm excited about the chance to avenge them.
You guys are the weird ones.
Diaz, I want you here with me interviewing witnesses.
The rest of you will search the secured area in the following teams: Santiago, Boyle; Jeffords and Peralta.
Get to work.
Okay. We'll start south of Nevins.
You two start at Bond and we'll rendezvous in the middle, assuming, of course, Boyle and I haven't already caught all the fugitives by the time you two show up.
Amy, there are nine hardened criminals running free in the streets.
This is hardly the time for childish trash talk.
It's time for a bet.
A crazy-ass bet.
What are you thinking?
Whoever catches the most fugitives gets to keep their apartment.
Loser moves in with the winner.
All right. I'm in.
I hope you like sleeping in a bed with a thousand pillows.
Well, I hope you like sharing my one grey towel.
Was it grey when you bought it?
I didn't buy it.
It was in the apartment when I moved in.
Are you sure you don't want to just move in with me?
We already shook on it. The bet stands.
Prepare to die, and by ""die,"" I mean move in with me.
Here we go.
I get that the streets are empty, but slow down, man.
Terry forgot his Dramamine.
Stakes are high, Sarge.
I know it doesn't matter to you, but I really want to beat Amy.
Doesn't matter? Look, I am completely on board.
You need your own space.
I had a painting studio in my apartment.
Was this in the '90s?
Did you wear overalls and no shirt?
Every chance I got.
(GASPS)
But then I moved in with Sharon.
And then the kids came along.
You know where I have to paint now?
(CLATTERING)
My acrylics!
I am not gonna let you lose this bet.
The march toward the closet starts with a single step.
Cool. So, basically just telling me not to get married and have kids... Anything from dispatch?
Security footage from a bank near the accident.
Two fugitives ran past going north toward Flatbush.
Looks like the arsonist and the gun runner.
Let's go after the arsonist first.
I thought of the perfect thing to say when we catch him that no one else could ever have possibly...
""You're burnt""?
No.
Initial reports had one of the fugitives heading south on Lincoln Place.
On it.
So, I know you're Jake's best friend, and...
Did he say that? Did you get that on tape?
No.
No, he didn't say that or no, you didn't get it on tape?
Doesn't matter. Either way, you screwed up big time.
Anyway, all I'm saying is I know you're Jake's best friend and you really want him to win this bet...
Are you kidding? That's the last thing I want.
Jake moving in with you is my dream come true.
Your apartment is two blocks away from mine.
Jake will be able to pop by any time.
(GASPS) Imagine it.
He's had a tough day. He's fighting with Amy.
You know how you let things escalate.
So, he just walks over to my place, bottle of wine in hand, and we just talk it out.
And then by the time that bottle's finished, you've come to your senses and apologized.
Maybe I don't want to win this bet.
Okay, we need to figure out whether this crash was an accident or part of a deliberate escape plan.
Gina, I need you manning the tip line.
Ha-ha! Good luck talking to the crazies.
Crazies?
Oh, Rosa.
Sad Rosa.
Have some respect for your fellow human beings.
What has gotten into you?
Solange just posted a video of a Kenyan human rights activist, Abdala, and I realized he and I are the only two people that can save the world.
I'm so excited.
Okay, Diaz, there are only two witnesses who were close enough to the crash to see something.
One's on his way here already.
His name is Marshawn Lynch.
(SQUEAKS) Marshawn Lynch?
Marshawn Lynch the football player?
I don't know his hobbies. It just says here he's unemployed.
Retired.
We're not getting anything out of him.
He's always getting fined for refusing to talk to the press.
Ugh, he's kind of one of my heroes.
Well, it may be tough, and it may take a while, but I'm sure we'll get him to open up.
Sir, there are some vaults you just can't open.
I ain't seen anything.
I was eating my quesadilla.
It was a good one. Chicken, cheese, guac.
But they forgot my pico de gallo.
I remember when I was a little boy, my mama used to make this, uh, she used to call it ""fo' cheese.""
What y'all call it? Y'all call it ""four""?
How come they never make quesadillas with sausage?
You throw some tomato sauce in there and call it a pizza-dilla... What you think?
What is going on?
This one time, I tried to wait up all night to catch Santa Claus, right?
You know how they tell you you got to put the cookies and the milk out?
I don't really be telling nobody this, but I like to sleep with the fan on, even when it's chilly outside.
All about that white noise, baby.
Stop. Stop talking, Marshawn Lynch.
Did you see anything after the van crashed?
Yes or no?
Nope. Like I told you, I was just eating my quesadilla.
Have I talked to y'all about my pizza-dilla invention?
Yes, well, I have other matters to attend to.
So, Detective Diaz, just take down everything Mr. Lynch has to say.
Captain...
(DOOR SHUTS)
You think he'll let me shoot his gun?
Jake, look.
You think it's our guys?
Maybe. But this is New York, so there's a very strong chance it's just ""city blood.""
NYPD! Freeze!
Freeze!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the precinct escaped convict number one!
Terry, where's the music? That was the cue.
I didn't have that Queen song on my phone.
I wasn't gonna pay $1.99 for it.
Nice work, man. You can put your perp in holding with the other three convicts.
Wait. Other three?
Yeah.
Santiago and Boyle brought them in.
That's right. It's three to one.
Guess you won't be needing this anymore since you'll be moving in with me.
My towel.
Yeah, your towel.
Why won't it burn?
Because it never fully dries.
The towel lives, and so do we!
****
Hey, Santiago, how did you guys catch three perps so quickly?
They weren't even close to each other.
Given the magnitude of the situation, we were given full access to any and all department resources.
That's right. We took a little trip down to the tactical supply armory.
No, you did not!
Thermal imaging, baby.
Thermal imaging baby?
Very handy in fugitive hunting.
Also...
I got this Flo-Tech performance polo with moisture-wicking technology.
Kept me dry all morning.
And a dry is a smart boy.
Ugh, he keeps saying that.
Charles, you've gotten negative reactions from everyone who's heard it.
I needed to see what Jake thought.
Oh, I hated it.
Really?
Anyway, gentlemen, we are off to catch some more convicts.
Two more, and we win.
Huh, just two?
(SCOFFS) No sweat.
Literally.
Get out of here. Take those glass cutters with you.
Oh, these lil' ol' things?
Tsst.
What?
Why'd you put your finger in the middle?
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. I was wondering if you could answer some questions about the car accident you witnessed this morning.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
What's she trying to tell us?
I don't know.
Probably ""Never meet your heroes, 'cause they're gonna turn out to be friendly.""
You need to get over this Marshawn Lynch situation real quick.
Now, we just have to figure out what language she's speaking so we can find a translator.
Here, ma'am.
Take a look at this map of the world.
You just keep one of those on you?
Of course. In case I ever need to prove my point in an argument.
Laos.
Fine!
Oh, it was better than fine.
It was Laos.
Mm.
So, where are you from?
Where did you grow up?
(SPEAKING SLOWLY) Where were you born?
What are you miming there, sir?
A child tying his tie.
Uh-huh. I'm trying to do a simple Half Windsor so she knows I'm a baby.
Look at this. See how basic this knot is?
I love these thermal goggles.
Amy, listen to me very carefully.
If you and Jake are thinking of trying, you are ovulating like crazy right now.
You take that helmet off before I knock it off.
What? Your basal temperature is off the charts.
This is a good thing.
(WHISPERS) Boyle!
NYPD! Get down!
Freeze!
Aah! The room's hot. I'm blowing out.
This way. Come on.
Oh, come on! Where did you guys even come from?
(HORN HONKS)
Your nightmares.
Hey, Amy, allow me to introduce you to Big Bertha.
Okay, I guess I'm not worth introducing to your truck.
That's right, y'all. We went to Homeland Security.
Yep, this beauty comes fully equipped with thermal imaging, a satellite link-up, and she plugs in to every surveillance camera in the city.
And she's also got a holding cell, which is big enough for three perps.
Jake, counting this guy, how many perps have we caught and placed in the three-perp perp cell?
Well, Sarge, we've placed three perps in the three-perp perp cell.
So, the three-perp perp cell's full?
Full of three perps is the three-perp perp cell.
Okay, stop saying ""perps"" and ""cell"" and ""three.""
You sound irritated. What's the score now?
Are you guys still ahead? Let me just check.
Oh, drone! Little help?
(DRONE BUZZING)
Yeah, I can't read that score. What does it say?
Anyway, I'm sure you're tracking whatever the score is.
All right, thank you, drone. That'll be all.
Whoop! Didn't see the tree there.
Big Bertha has a drone. That's what's important.
What are you trying to tell us?
Is this some kind of a clue?
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Draw better. We have no idea what this is.
I think it's a cookie.
No. It's a pizza.
(TOGETHER) (GASP) It's a cookie pizza!
Another case solved.
No. Detectives, we...
Shh shh shh. Let them go.
She's taking us somewhere. This is good. This is good.
We're gonna crack this, Diaz.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Nope. She just needed to take a dump.
Okay, satellite images showed one of the two remaining convicts entered this building.
If we catch him, that's five. I win the bet.
Amy moves in with me. I lord it over her.
She's miserable. We live happily ever after.
It's fool-proof.
There's got to be 30 floors in this building.
It'll take forever to sweep the whole place.
Nuh-uh. We can use Big Bertha to tap into the security cameras.
(WHIRRING, BEEPING)
Ohh.
(LAUGHING)
Okay. This room is clear, but check that closet.
Man, this is like playing the coolest video game ever.
My character is Terry.
It's locked.
Ooh, kick it down.
Front kick! Front kick!
All clear.
Now strafe. Strafe!
I don't know what that means.
Barrel roll. Duck.
Duck?
Just tell me where to go, man.
Wait a minute. Slide one of your feet forward.
Now switch.
Now punch both your fists forward at the same time.
Are you making me do the running man?
Yeah. The original one.
Excluding the movie.
And Stephen King's classic short story.
So, the third iteration.
I'm going off on my own.
(GASPS) He has sentience.
It's ""Westworld.""
Oh, wait a minute, Sarge. I don't have eyes on that room.
Hang on. I'll find it.
Oh, no. Sarge, just hang on. I'm coming for you.
****
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Drop the weapon.
You drop your weapon.
Okay, stay cool.
We can work this out. I'm a trained hostage negotiator.
I got my friend's sperm back from his ex-wife last year.
Well, she destroyed half of it, and he decided to adopt, but...
Peralta!
Right. Sorry.
What do you want?
You let me walk out of this building and get into a car.
If anyone tries to stop me...
(GRUNTS) Got him.
Oh, well, you know, I think that makes it four to four.
No. No. You don't get credit for this guy.
I was in the middle of negotiating, and he was about to give up... Tell him, guy.
No, I was probably gonna kill him, then let you kill me.
Oh, my God. I should've been way more scared.
Well, there's just one convict left.
Whoever finds him wins.
Yeah. I guess you could say he's... the Golden Snitch.
Wait. Was that a ""Harry Potter"" reference?
It most definitely was. I started reading them 'cause you love them so much.
And?
You were right. They're incredible.
Remember when I called in sick the other day?
I was at home reading ""Order of the Phoenix.""
Oh, this makes me so happy!
How sad is it when Cedric dies?
I was crushed.
Literally crying on the toilet.
Aww.
Guys. The fugitive. The bet?
Right.
I'm gonna catch this last fugitive, win the bet, and then we're gonna live together for the rest of our relationship.
Just you and me and towel makes three.
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Just so you know, at the end of the sixth book, Snape kills...
La-la-la-la-! No spoilies!
Terry, let's go.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
It really sounds Slavic.
Does anyone here know any Slavic languages?
Oh, I'm great at languages. Watch this.
(YELLING) Hello! I am Hitchcock!
(YELLING) Thank you for the cookie-pizza idea!
I believe it was human rights leader Abdala who once said ""When the choir shouts the loudest, the most powerful one is silent.""
That doesn't even make any sense.
Well, I might have paraphrased it incorrectly.
But allow me to introduce to you Rob.
Rob, come on in.
He called the tip line.
But he's so... not crazy-looking.
Rosa, have Abdala and I taught you nothing about stereotyping?
I'm beginning to feel like you're our biggest project, sweetie.
That's enough. What did he tell you?
Well, let's find out, okay? Together.
Rob, do you want to share your experience with the group?
Gladly.
Okay, so, you know how there's a subterranean race of lizard-people living beneath the city who control our minds with their pheromones?
Okay, he's a wackadoodle.
Gina, get your wackadoodle out of here.
It's been two hours, and nothing on the last guy.
He's gonna get away.
Where are you, number nine?
Think. If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?
(GASPS)
Where?
Oh, I have no idea. I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.
And I did.
No, that didn't work either.
Or did it? Still no.
Unless...
Stop it, Jake!
Well, Marshawn Lynch will not leave your office.
He has now pulled up one of those wedding proposal viral videos on his phone and is crying.
What did I do to deserve this?
Well, I haven't fared any better.
She keeps drawing her stupid circle pictures and then running off to the bathroom.
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
We get it. You have a bum-tum. Yes.
Ugh! You think you guys have it rough.
I've been stuck here listening to crazy Rob spew his insane garbage What happened to your positive attitude, Abdala?
Don't even say that name, all right?
I tweeted him and got nothing.
Meanwhile, Rob tweets him some crap about lizard-people, he's like, ""Oh, retweet, oh, fave"" everything.
I just told him I saw one of them slip back into his lizard home under the streets.
That's where they make their soup.
Oh, my God. He's onto something.
Captain, don't try to be nice by giving a crazy person a voice.
Plus, we've already learned that human rights are crap.
No, he said that the lizard-people live under the streets.
He means the sewers. He saw someone go from the van into the sewers.
Look.
It's a manhole cover.
(BOTH YELL WOMAN'S FOREIGN PHRASE)
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Peralta, Santiago?
Yeah, we're here.
Us too, Captain.
We have a lead. One of our witnesses saw the last convict, George Gessilnick, the murderer, go down into a manhole and escape into the sewer near the crash site.
Copy that. We're on it.
Yeah, so are we. We're also on it.
Whoop! (LAUGHS) Back it up a little bit.
(BEEPING)
Forward.
Back.
Forward.
Back.

Oh, my God, what a beautiful moment.
And, you guys, Amy's ovulating as we speak!
What?
Charles!
All right, head to the back. You're going to jail.
Hey.
I don't get it. Why did you decide to let me win?
I don't know. When we were back there racing through the Miranda Rights, I just looked over at you and thought, ""You're awesome.
And you're good at doing things.""
I mean, sure, I'll miss towel, but your happiness is worth way more than winning some stupid bet.
Are you sure about this?
Oh, yeah.
Your apartment is better than mine in every way imaginable.
You want to know what my first thought was when we dropped into the sewer?
""Smells like home.""
He's lying, Amy.
His first thought was about the Ninja Turtles.
Come on, Terry. We were in a sewer.
He's gon'sta think about the Turtles.
Yeah, I'm gon'sta, Terry.
Quit being such a Malfoy.
Yeah, Terry.
Guys, we have a problem.
He's not our convict.
What? The guy in the orange jumpsuit that we found hiding in the sewer is not our convict?
He's our van driver.
A man came to me last week.
He told me I had to help Gessilnick escape from jail.
He had pictures of my family.
He said he'd kill them if I didn't help.
So, I crashed the van, and Gessilnick took my clothes.
But then where's the guy we thought was the van driver?
He vanished. George Gessilnick, posing as a Department of Corrections driver, was taken to the hospital, where he escaped some hours later.
He's highly dangerous, probably armed, and could be anywhere.
Detective Diaz has some background information to help in the search.
So this is one scary dude.
We don't have a complete rap sheet on him because he's had so many aliases, but we know he's killed at least five people.
He's been in the system since he was 11.
That's when he stole $4,000 from his foster family and burned their house down.
Wait a minute. This is the foster family?
Yeah. Why?
Did you see who the brother is?
I need to get a message to somebody.
This is very important. Tell him Jake Peralta wants to see him.
I'm not after him. I just need his help.
Hello?
I followed all your rules.
I'm unarmed. I'm not wearing a wire.
I came alone. There's no backup.
Come on, man. I need your help to take down your brother.
Doug Judy. The Pontiac Bandit.
Hey, baby.
Nice legs.
Why are you in your boxers?
So you would know I'm not wearing a wire.
Your buddy Scott said I had to.
Oh, that makes sense. Scott's a perv.
Hey, Scott, wherever you're watching from, go home!
Sorry, man. (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
So, what's so important?
I'm looking for your foster brother, George.
Hate the guy. Stole from my mom, burned our house down.
Worst of all, he ran off with my LP of Phil Collins' ""No Jacket Required.""
It's my favorite album.
Haven't heard it in 20 years.
I mean, can't you just stream it?
Can't do that to Phil. ""Sussudio"" demands vinyl.
Right. Vinyl and whatnot. Okay, well, George is a murderer now and he just escaped from prison.
We think he might be trying to flee the country.
You want me to help you catch him?
Like when X-men teamed up with Magneto to stop Apocalypse.
I heard that one was bad.
Wasn't great.
I still want to see it though.
I'd watch it again.
So, does that mean you're in?
Course I am.
Damn, it feels good to be on the same team for once.
A cop and a criminal working together. (GASPS)
We need a theme song.
♪ The Pontiac Bandit and Jake the cop ♪
Oh!
♪ Taking down crooks ♪
♪ In the streets where they live ♪
♪ Flirting with girls who are hot for the badge ♪
♪ There's a talking police dog that helps them solve crime ♪
You gave him full immunity? Are you insane?
You told me to cut a deal.
I thought you'd maybe drop charges on one or two felonies.
But do you know how many crimes we're forgiving?
Six...
That's not so bad.
Hundred!
Oh, that's way more.
""Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto. Dog fraud.""
I sold a guy a fake Pekinese.
'Twas a cat.
You will not win me over with your use of ""'twas.""
'Twasn't trying to.
(SNORTS)
You're clearly friends with this man, and you've lost your objectivity, Peralta.
Or have you lost your objectivity?
What are you doing?
My bad. I thought we were leaving.
No. I'm just making a point here. Sit down.
Look, sir. There's a triple-murderer loose in Brooklyn, and it's our job to bring him in, even if that means forgiving a guy who stole some cars, and, yes, sold a few cats as dogs.
More than a few.
Weird how many people fell for that.
Plus, his deal is conditional.
If Judy doesn't lead us to his brother, he doesn't get immunity.
Look, Cap, I want to see George behind bars as much as you do.
I hate my brother.
You can relate to that, right, sir?
Remember how furious you got that time your sister ended an email with ""thx"" instead of ""thanks""?
Why would you bring that up?
It seemed pertinent.
Fine.
Let's see where this leads.
Dismissed.



So we don't know if anybody helped George Judy escape from this hospital.
Security cameras show him entering this courtyard, but never coming back out.
The dude just vanished.
Ugh. Terry hates hospitals.
They reek of death.
Ahem.
Oh, not you, ma'am.
You reek of life.
Maybe he went up the wall like this.
(GRUNTS)
Never mind. It's not possible.
You sure?
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Damn, Rosa! How did you do that?
I have a dark past.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Now you know my deepest shame.
Cool. Well, now that I saw you do it, I get how to do it too.
(GRUNTS)
Ooh, damn, Terry.
Hey, guys. Guess what.
To thank you for being such good friends, I picked up a big old basket of muffins.
Follow me.
Come on!
I got all kinds of muffins!
Blueberry muffins, poppy seed muffins, banana nut muffins, chocolate chip...
Ooh, wait, there are no muffins.
What's happening now?
How's it feel being lied to, Huh?
I mean, I'm okay. I wasn't really that invested in the muffins.
I was.
You guys thought you could keep a secret from me?
Well, I know everything.
Hitchcock left his phone in the bathroom again, and guess what I found on it.
I needed the cash. I didn't know they'd be filming.
Text chains. Dozens of text chains.
And I'm not on any of them.
Take a look at this board.
There's an Amy-Gina-Terry- Hitchcock-Rosa-Jake chain.
There's a Hitchcock-Terry- Amy-Rosa Chain.
There's even a Hitchcock-Gina- Scully chain.
I mean, what the hell happens on that?
Well, we mostly just exchange ""Game of Thrones"" theories.
The little guy is gonna marry a dragon.
We think.
Well, one thing's for sure: Charles Boyle... is off the chains.
I'm sorry.
We only excluded you because you're kind of... an over-texter.
Over-texter? That's not even a thing.
Oh really? So you don't remember the time you sent 97 unanswered texts in a five-minute span?
My phone vibrated itself off the desk.
I think it was committing suicide.
It's okay. This isn't the first time I've been left out.
At camp, nobody would be friends with me.
I had to hang out with the lunch ladies.
After summer ended, they never replied to any of my letters.
Oh, this is really sad.
There's just no muffins at all.
Kaboom!
What's this?
That is the art auction that George Judy will be robbing tonight.
Why is it so sticky?
I was eating sour straws.
It's crazy that's what you're choosing to focus on.
Doug Judy came through for us.
That's what George is after: a bejeweled egg worth $20 million.
That's a nice egg, but how do you know he'll be there?
Doug's boy Parker said he kept asking about the place.
And what does this Parker do?
You know, I don't know. I can't really recall.
Some sort of auto-industry professional.
Maybe, like, a car thief or some such whatnot.
Oh, I see. So the only thing we have to go on is the word of one of your criminal friends?
Criminals? That's how you see us?
Is it a crime to steal bread to feed your family?
Or to sell some weed so you can buy video games?
Or to steal video games because you smoked all that weed you were supposed to sell?
Yes, all of those are crimes.
Damn. Even the bread one?
Especially the bread one.
But since this is the only lead you have, go do something with it.
Oh, we'll go do something with it.
We'll go do something with the hell out of it.

No, no, no.
He's not a cop.
He can't be wearing any of this.
It's just a windbreaker.
It's not like I gave him a badge and a gun.
Uh, he has both of those things.
It's not loaded.
I just want to cock it and say a cool cop catch phrase.
(COCKS GUN)
New York's finest just got a whole lot finer.
Give me that.

Whoo. Okay.
How do I look? Like I'm about to buy a bunch of expensive art?
Hell, yeah. And not just paintings either.
You look statue rich.
I didn't know we'd have to valet.
Perhaps I shouldn't have brought Gertie.
Who's Gertie?
(CHUCKLES)
That foxy little she-devil we just drove here in.
Gertie? No, man.
A car's gotta have a sexy name, like Brooke, or Tiffany, or Sandra, or Candice.
Yeah, or Suzie, or Dana, or Karen.
Oh, no, wait. That's my mom's name.
Why did I say my mom's name?
Ugh.
The sight of another man inside her makes me sick.
Yeah. I dislike this conversation very much.
Treat her gently!
You know that's not a nice car, right?
Say that again.
Damn, Cap. Be cool.
Say that again.
That's what I thought.
I'll be in the venue.
Come on, Boyle.
What's this about?
Look, if you're leading me to some sort of big surprise apology where everyone's there and you all want me to join your stupid text chains, I am 100% in.
These last 24 hours have just been hell.
Oh, it's just my former lover. Hello, sister.
Ugh, I hate when you say those things back-to-back.
Here.
You took my phone?
Yeah. I had to delete your GIF keyboard and your three ""Property Brothers"" emoji apps.
Wait. Did you delete them because...
Yeah. You're on the office text chain.
Are you serious? This is amazing.
Yeah, well I was totally against it, but Amy felt bad because you seemed so pathetic.
Don't say that.
It worked!
I mean, your little camp story.
Was the saddest childhood memory I've ever heard, and I've listened to Amy talking about attending ""the crossing guard's jamboree.""
That was fun! We were directing traffic in the hotel hallways.
People were freaking out.
Mm-hmm. Just don't make us regret this.
I won't. I swear I won't.
I gotta tell my dad.
I know you weren't on board with this, but look how happy we made him.
And at no cost to our... (PHONE CHIMES) oh.
And here it comes.
No.
That was just one... (PHONE CHIMES) uh-oh.
(PHONE CHIMING REPEATEDLY)
I bet he's just getting it out of his system.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he'll be brief.
Apparently the Tsar of Russia gave that bejeweled egg to his girlfriend as a present.
I've never gotten a bejeweled anything. Stupid Amy.
Well, I highly doubt our murderer is gonna show up here.
Doug Judy said he's be here, and I believe him.
Cap, got some hors d'oeuvres.
I don't know what you like, so I guessed: the radishes they put on the side for decoration?
Mmm, thank you. Cut into a flower?
Where are we, Las Vegas?
Guys, look over there by the hallway.
See the woman in the red?
I think that's my brother's girlfriend, Fran.
I don't want her to recognize me.
Does she have a scar on her left cheek?
Maybe. What's the shape of the scar?
Just a general slash shape.
Oh, darn.
I've been reading a lot of ""Harry Potter"" lately, and I was hoping for something more fun.
Okay, I'll head towards her.
You go around back in case she makes a break for it.
She's on the move.
Excuse me, ma'am. Oh.
No, please stop.
Freeze. NYPD.
What's going on?
No scar. It's not Fran.
Then why was she running?
Because a strange guy started following me to the bathroom.
Right. Because men are horrible and the world is a nightmare. Yeah.
Oh, no. Where's Doug Judy?
Where we left him. Why?
Scarface Fran is a ruse.
He wanted us out of there so he can help his brother steal the egg!
Check it out. Shot glasses of soup.
Oh, you wondering how I got the whole tray?
Charmed it right out of her ♪ hands ♪
You want some soup?
This where you been all day?
Yep. Just looking for clues.
Trying to see how George Judy escaped.
You're pretty sweaty.
Terry runs hot.
Terry runs hot.
You're trying to see if you can do that wall climb, aren't you?
Yeah.
And I can't. I'm old.
Because you can't parkour up a wall?
It's everything.
The TV's always too quiet.
I don't like how baggy basketball shorts are.
I even shook my fist at some skateboarders the other day.
Oof.
And there's something worse.
Way, way worse.
(SOFT MUSIC)
Terry needs reading glasses.
It's not that bad, Sarge.
Yes, it is!
I used to be ""Batman.""
Now I'm his dad.
His dumb, weak, getting shot at the opera dad.
Okay, auction over.
I can't believe you thought Doug Judy was tricking us so he could steal the egg.
If anyone was stealing any eggs, it was you 'cause you have egg all over your face.
Is that why you've been so quiet these last four minutes?
You had to think of that?
Mm-hmm. Was it worth it?
Hell, yeah.
Ah, venomous burn.
(BOTH HISSING)
Suck out the poison.
(INHALING RAPIDLY, SPITS)
Wow.
He may not have been pulling something back there, but both of you were wrong about George Judy.
He never showed. We wasted a day, and if anyone has egg on their faces, it's you two.
Doug Egg and Egg Peralta.
That's actually kind of a dope name.
What's going on out there?
Hey, Jake Peralta, NYPD. What happened here?
Somebody knocked out the valet, stole all the cars.
Every single one.
So George was here.
He wasn't after the egg, he was after the cars.
Well, looks like Doug Judy was right after all, huh, Captain?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Is it because you're so embarrassed for being wrong?
Gertie!
♪ What a big bomb, the Captain's car is gone ♪
Shut up! Shut up!
****
I don't get it. Why would George Judy steal all these cars and not the egg?
Easier to sell if you're in a hurry.
Plus these are some valuable vehicles.
Bugatti, Ferrari...
Gertie.
I don't think Gertie was a prime target, sir.
Do you know how much custom work there was on her?
I disabled the FM function from the radio.
The guy said, ""Oh, you can just not use it,"" but I said, ""Ugh, I'll always know it's there.""
Boom. Shelby Cobra 427SC.
That's a million dollars on four wheels, baby.
That's what George is after.
How do we even know George did it?
I mean, nobody saw him.
But there was a prolific car thief at the scene of the crime.
You talking about me? I'm a cop now.
No, you're not.
Then why do I have a badge and a gun? (COCKS GUN)
The thin blue line just got thick as hell.
Give me that!
Come on, Judy.
It's not loaded.
Look, if I was gonna jack a bunch of cars, I would bring two of New York's best detectives with me to the scene of the crime.
Aww, you think we're the best?
Flattery won't work on us.
What?
This is nonsense.
You're off the case.
Whoa, whoa, sir. Come on.
We're chasing a murderer.
A murderer that just stole a ton of cars.
Who knows more about that world than Doug Judy?
Plus remember, he doesn't get immunity unless he helps us bring his brother in.
I know, but...
Do you want to get back Gertie or not?
Fine. He's still on the case.

Okay, Charles, I was you on this text chain.
I really do, but since you joined yesterday, you have sent 71 texts.
The rest of the group collectively has sent two.
You know, honestly, I'd rather get hit by a bus than get one more text from you, Charles.
Fine. I've been kicked out of things before.
At camp, I found a slam book that the lunch ladies had written about me.
I'm sorry, Charles, but there is no story sad enough to save you now.
Challenge accepted.
Once, as a tween, I got my pen1s entirely...
Okay, stop! No, no, no, no, no.
Our plan was just to teach you to text better.
You know, a lot of people like the way I text.
Look, if you can't accept me for who I am, then I don't need this chain.
Okay, great.
No, no, no, I need to be included so badly.
I'll do whatever you say. I literally have zero pride.
And that's what I like to hear.
Oh, Charles.
Okay, so you guys are rich Europeans looking to buy a Shelby. I'll make the introductions.
Wait, we can't just be Europeans.
What country are we from?
What languages do you speak?
French, Spanish, some Portuguese.
Obviously Greek, enough Flemish to get by.
Tight. What about you, Peralta?
Um, I can do a pretty good Italian accent.
(IMITATING ROBERT DE NIRO) ""You think you could milk me?""
So you're just doing De Niro from ""Meet the Parents?""
I don't know, am I?
That's a terrible De Niro.
I don't know.
This is De Niro.
I think it's pretty good.
Mine's better.
It's pretty good.
We'll just make you American.
Okay.
Griff.
Hey, Doug Judy.
Hey.
What can I do for you?
Hey, did my brother stop by?
I heard he jacked some nice cars, and I might have a buyer.
This is Maxime Dubois, international millionaire.
Bonjour.
He doesn't speak any English.
This is his lawyer, Carl Mangerson.
Hey, I'm a lawyer.
Maxine wants to buy a Shelby Cobra.
I hear George might have one.
He just dropped off a few cars, but he didn't say anything about no Cobra.
I mostly deal with scrap and crap, you know?
Son of a bitch.
Hey, hey, is everything all right here, Maxime?
You're speaking good English.
Eh, just a few phrases he picked up from movies and such.
He's disappointed. He really wanted that Cobra.
You know the French, so passionate, even their skunks. Pepé Le Pew.
It doesn't matter; I'm a lawyer. No further comments.
Do you know where George is?
Maybe I can do business with him myself.
(GASPS) Gertie!
What?
Uh, that was French for...
(MOANING)
(IMITATING FRENCH ACCENT) ""I gotta make a phone call.""
He's gotta make a phone call.

So if George went over that wall, he would have been caught on a security camera across...
Whatcha eating there, Sarge?
Cream of Wheat.
It's easy to chew, and it keeps you regular.
It's a favorite dish of the elderly.
Stop freaking out about this.
Yeah, yeah, I know. ""I'm young at heart.""
No, you are super old at heart.
You always have been. You love yogurt.
You volunteer at your polling place.
You refuse to deposit your checks at an ATM.
It's a machine. I don't trust it.
I get what you're saying, but at least I used to be a prime physical specimen.
Dude, you have, like, 1% body fat.
Now I'm at 1.8. I'm fat.
I'm a fat, bald old man.
You shave your head.
Yeah, Rosa.
Vin Diesel and I shave our heads because we think it looks good.
Okay, you obviously want to sit here feeling sorry for yourself, but we have work to do.
So, I don't know, why don't I get you a wheelchair and a box of diapers.
The wheelchair!
That's how he escaped. He dressed up like an old lady.
That orderly is pushing him out.
He did have an accomplice.
I'm gonna find this b*st*rd.
I don't need this anymore.
I should take my jacket, though.
I mean, it's January. I ain't crazy.

Psst. George is here.
He's out back.
Let's go. Right now.
NYPD, don't move!
Crap, he's getting away!

Bye, Peralta.
No! Judy!

Oh, I can't believe this!
I really thought I could trust Doug Judy this time.
I kept telling you not to, but you wouldn't listen.
You were too busy singing your songs and planning trips to Niagara Falls.
We just said neither of us had ever been.
There were no hard plans.
(SIGHS) Look, it's humiliating.
Doug Judy thought he could manipulate me, and he could.
I feel like I'm a terrible cop.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Wow, I really thought you were going to chime in with something supportive there.
We have to go.
(SCOFFS) Captain?
Okay, Charles. This is your final exam.
We're gonna show you a text and then two potential responses.
You need to tell us which is more appropriate.
Amy writes, ""Leaving the virgin festival...""
Gina... ""Be there in ten minutes.""
Do you reply, ""I'll be counting down the seconds. 600, 599, 598, JK, LOL, 597, 596, smiley face, smiley face, cat smiley, thumbs up.""
Or, ""Okay.""
It's a trick question. The text requires no response.
Charles Boyle, welcome back to the Nine-Nine text chain.
Yes! We should call it the Nine-Nine party line I'll rename the thread.
Charles.
Sorry. I'll be better. I'll be better.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
There's the car. How'd you know they'd be here?
Detective's intuition.
Okay, fine. We went to Dave and Buster's together and got separated, so we turned on Find My Friends.
(COCKS GUN)
The stairs are in the back.
Looking for us?
Put your guns down, turn around slowly.
What the hell, Judy? I thought we were friends.
I don't know why you thought that.
'Cause you kept saying we were.
We had hard plans to go to Niagara Falls.
So, bro, you friends with this cop?
Nah. This thirsty-ass bitch is just desperate for attention.
Thirsty-ass bitch?
Okay, Captain, now I know you're going to step in and defend me.
Well, you were begging me to compliment you earlier.
Oh, my God. This is the worst day of my life.
Where's Charles?
So, if you're not friends, you won't mind if I waste him, right?
Of course he minds. I mean, sure, we're enemies, but in, like, a playful way, like Tom and Jerry.
Oh, my God. Was Tom trying to eat Jerry?
My whole life is a lie.
Shoot him.
No, no, no. Those can't be my last words.
Uh, ay caramba.
(GUN CLICKS)

Had to. I saw he was about to get away, so I tricked him into thinking I was on his side.

Doug Judy, I underestimated your honesty.
And, Peralta, I underestimated your instincts.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a lot more from you than that.

Nope.
But she is the exact same make, model, and color.
Oh, my God, you stole this.
I can't be driving a stolen...
Relax, man.
I bought it at a used car lot for, like, $600.
This is not a nice vehicle.
Yeah, it's not.
And by the way, her name's not Gertie.
It's Sexarella.
Hello, Sexarella.
So, what's next for you, Doug Judy?
I'm turning over a new leaf.
Gonna live that honest life.
Maybe open up a bakery, buy a little house, invest in my retirement.
You're gonna go back to stealing cars immediately, aren't you?
That's very much on the table.
Yeah.
And when you do...
I'll be there to stop you.
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
I'm gonna miss you, man.
I'm gonna miss you, brother.

And now on to new business.  
Peralta. There's a case I'd like you to handle.  
Methodist Hospital called this morning.  
Apparently, a   -year-old investment banker was admitted last night with a broken pen1s.  
- It looks like...
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.  
There's a finance guy with a broken dong?  
Uh, methinks some ""Wolf of Wall Street"" style shenana-googles have taken place this day.   
Anyone care to wager a guess as to how this happened?   
Yeah, I bet he dipped it in a pile of cocaine, got it real numb, and then hit a croquet ball with it.   
- Totally possible.
- He probably sat on it.   
- So it got under his butt.
- Happens all the time.   
- Sure do.
- Ugh, you guys are horrible.   
And you're wrong because he was clearly driving his Bentley naked, tried to pee out the window, and was then struck by a goose on the wang.   
Is that what happened, sir? Was he struck by a goose?   
He was actually struck by a female coworker who claims he attempted to sexually assault her.   
- [all groan]
- I really wish you had stopped us before we started guessing.   
I'm not responsible for that.   
Now due to the sensitive subject matter, I think it makes sense to partner Peralta with...   
Me? Because I'm the best at s*x?   
No, Hitchcock. In fact, you know what?   
This isn't your week.
Why don't you take a few days off?   
Sweet!   
- Have fun working, cucks!
- What?   
Captain, I'd like to work the case with Jake.   
I have the time.   
I'm three weeks ahead on my paperwork.   
Fine. Santiago and Peralta, talk to both parties.   
Get to the bottom of this broken pen1s.   
Wait. I just want to say I think it's sad that we as a society can no longer laugh at the phrase ""broken pen1s,"" and it is my dream that we one day shall again. Team Broken pen1s on three.   
- One, two, three...
- Broken pen1s!   
Yeah, probably should've seen that coming.   
[upbeat music] 
♪ ♪ 
Mr. Haggerty, please have a seat. 
Oh, you can stand if that's more comfortable.   
No, it's cool.   
The doctor said I need to change positions frequently so I don't form a penile clot.   
Oh, I'm not gonna barf, so on that note, please explain the events that led to your diaper.   
So last night I was giving my coworker, Keri, some pointers on her trades.   
Told her ""lever up on VTC.   
There's no fat tail on the vol's wicked low.""   
I just didn't want her to chump it.   
Right, and you spoke that way because you were...   
- snowboarding?
- No, we were in my office.   
- Yeah.
- Anyway, she just flipped out and hit me with my favorite golf club.   
Ms. Brennan is claiming she attacked you in self-defense after you sexually assaulted her.   
[chuckles] Yeah, because she's crazy.   
I know we're not supposed to say that about women.   
I usually wouldn't go there because I'm a huge advocate.   
I mean, I'm the kind of guy who thinks Kathryn Bigelow   
should direct the next ""Star Wars.""   
I've said that out loud to other men.   
Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.
We'll be in touch.   
Great, thanks. [unevenly] I'm gonna stand up now.   
[gradually bellows]   
- [knocks]
- Captain, sorry to interrupt.   
I just got off the phone with the Department of Corrections.   
They wanted me to let you know that Ernest Zumowski died.   
My goodness.   
It's been a while since I've heard that name.   
I hunted him for years and finally caught him and put an end to his bloodlust.   
In some sick way, I am who I am because of Ernest Zumowski   
- AKA...
- ALL: The Disco Strangler.   
Oh, so you knew who I was talking about?   
Yeah, sir, you talk about him a lot.   
- You know, the yo-yo was his...
- ALL: Calling card.   
Oh, I mentioned that too?
So how'd he die?   
He was in a prison transport van, and he got in a terrible accident.   
It burst into flames, and he was trapped inside.   
[laughing]   
Well, well, well, he finally did it.   
- Died horribly?
- Escaped.   
Just like he said he would all those years ago.   
I'll be coming back for you.   
I'm just like disco, baby.
I will never die.   
True, disco will never die, but you will...   
ALL: In your cell, punk.   
Oh, so I've told that part of the story as well?   
Yes, at every Christmas party.   
Sir, I am the first to tout the capabilities of senior citizens.    
I have made love to many, but the Disco Strangler is over   .    
I doubt that he could pull off an escape like this.    
Oh, that's what he wants you to think.    
You're both underestimating him.    
I know    other people who did that, and they all ended up with yo-yos    
- around their throats.
- BOTH: Necks.    
Nope, I said ""throats,"" not necks, which means I haven't told that story too many times.    
All right, lace up your dancing shoes because it's time to catch this disco b*st*rd.    
Thank you for coming in, Ms. Brennan.    
Can you describe your working relationship with Mr. Haggerty?    
Absolutely. Seth hired me three years ago to help with large-scale statistical arbitrage and ever since we've been at a steady   % yield.    
I didn't know most of those words, but I'm assuming it means you're good at business.    
I am good. I brought in $    million to the firm last quarter.    
Wow, that's a lot of money.    
Where do you keep it all? It's in a computer.    
I've watched too much ""DuckTales.""    
No, you can never watch too much ""DuckTales.""    
It's my dream to have a gold coin pool.    
- Like Scrooge McD. Continue.
- Look.    
I love my job, and I'm really good at it.    
I would never do anything to jeopardize what I have, and I'm not a violent person, but last night Seth crossed a line.    
Can you tell us what happened?    
I was working late, and he called me into his office.    
He had clearly been drinking, and before I knew it, he pushed me into a desk and he tried to take my clothes off.    
So I grabbed his stupid golf club and I hit him in the Cookie Monster, which is what he calls his pen1s, by the way.    
- Gross.
- He's the worst.    
My only regret is that I didn't get in two extra whacks for each of his testicles.    
What does he call those? Bert and Ernie?    
You are actually correct.    
Ugh, I hate that I got that right.    
So in conclusion: the burns on Zumowski's body are consistent with a massive vehicle fire.    
- If this even is his body.
- Excuse me?    
We're talking about the Disco Strangler...a serial killer, who for six years stayed one step ahead of the entire NYPD.    
Not sure he had many steps left in him, sir.    
- Take a look.
- Aw.    
- He looks fragile and sweet.
- Sweet as poison pie.    
Were you able to match the dental records    
- to the Disco Strangler?
- No, the body had no teeth.    
- Well, that's suspicious.
- Not really.    
Zumowski didn't have any teeth either.    
- Due to him being very old?
- Yes.    
What about the fact that this corpse is    inches tall when the Disco Strangler was   ?    
He shrank over time.    
Is that another old person thing?    
Yes, it is. Another old person thing.    
- Mm-hmm.
- We also have a DNA match between hair on the head of this body and the Disco Strangler.    
Sir, this is clearly Zumowski.    
And that's a good thing.    
You can finally say good-bye to your nemesis.    
Thanks, sergeant. That's a nice thought.    
For an idiot to have. Look at this.    
A dirty little string?    
Oh, it's not just any old string.    
It's a yo-yo string, the most dangerous part of the yo-yo.    
The Strangler wanted me to find this.    
He's out there, and he's taunting me.    
[door opens]    
Okay, Ms. Brennan, we've discussed it, and we think you should file charges against Mr. Haggerty for sexual assault.    
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a difficult process...    
Actually, I'm gonna stop you right there.    
I don't wanna press charges.    
The firm just offered me $ .  million if I sign an NDA and let this slide.    
Wait, so you're gonna let Seth get off Scot-free?    
Well, that money would go a long way towards the Scrooge pool. Sorry, ignore me.    
- ""DuckTales."" Woo-oo.
- I mean, I think    
I have to take it.    
This is a ""he said, she said,"" situation.    
I know how that goes down.    
No one's gonna convict him on my word alone.    
The system's as broken as Seth's dong.    
No, it's not. I'm the system.    
And I'm nothing like Seth's dong.    
It feels like we can move off this analogy.    
Just don't sign that NDA right now.    
Give us a chance to bring this guy to justice.    
And how are you gonna do that?    
By working our asses off to find proof that he assaulted you, and when we do, he will go to jail for what he did.    
I really think we can get him.    
Okay. Yeah, let's do this.    
Oh, man, I'm reading Keri's statement.    
If I was a woman, I would not work in finance.    
Oh, because it's so easy for women everywhere else.    
Okay, I can tell that I am in trouble.    
You're not in trouble.    
I just don't think that men understand how different everything is for us.    
I can think of a million examples from this week alone.    
Oh, sick!    
Oh, sick!    
- Have a great day.
- Oh, thanks.    
- You too.
- Mm-hmm.    
You have a beautiful mouth. Have a great day.    
Excuse me, Miss, do you know where I can find a police officer?    
Uh, sir, you're a police officer, right?    
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
- Oh, thank God.    
I'm in uniform!    
Oh, that's why you yelled that.    
I thought you were just excited about your general love of uniforms.    
Usually when I yell that, it is because of my love of uniforms but not today.    
Today it was because of that sexist jerk.    
God, how many creeps have I not noticed before... oh, no.    
The fruit seller guy on our corner, is he a creep?    
No, he's a real gentleman, which is surprising because he's always holding those two cantaloupes and the opportunity to be gross is right there.    
Is it? I've never even noticed that before.    
I never wanted to make a comment or anything like that and thought better.
[sniffles] Anyways.    
I am genuinely very sorry that this is something you have to go through all the time.    
It's okay. I'm used to it.    
That's even sadder.    
I know. But you know what's not sad?    
That Keri didn't take that insane amount of hush money, and now we get    
- to put a bad guy in jail.
- Amen.    
Wait, her firm offered her a big deal and you told her    
- not to take it?
- Yeah.    
Because that would mean letting a sexual assaulter go free.    
Do you have any physical evidence to prove that he did it?    
No.    
So it sounds like he might go free anyway.    
I mean, at least if she takes the deal, she won't walk away with nothing.    
I'm surprised you feel like that.    
You're such a feminist.    
I feel like maybe I shouldn't be here.    
I am a feminist, but I'm also a realist.    
I'm just looking out for the victim.    
Or should I be here because men should be part of the conversation?    
Let's say best case scenario you do find evidence.    
She's still gonna have to go through a very public trial where they drag her name through the mud.    
Even if she wins, she still loses.    
It's two steps forward, one step back.    
I've landed on active listening.    
I will no longer be chiming in.    
Yeah, but when one person comes forward, it inspires others to speak up.    
And that's a hell of a lot better than taking a deal that lets sexual predators walk free.    
Dude, obviously, I get that.    
I'm just saying, remember that there's a very real woman here whose career and life are gonna be affected by you pursuing this case.    
I'm just saying, consider what's best for her.    
All right, the state police is deploying    men and four helicopters to comb the area of the accident.    
I felt comfortable saying this disco-man has danced his last disco dance.    
Sir, it's fun to see you breaking out the old lingo, but do you think you're jumping the gun?    
All the evidence points to the Strangler being dead.    
- Not all the evidence.
- Right.    
The random piece of thread you think is a yo-yo string.    
It is a yo-yo string.    
The most dangerous part of the yo-yo.    
It just feels like you're trying to relive    
- your glory days.
- Absurd.    
Well, what do you have in that box over there?    
Memories and keepsakes of my greatest cases.    
- BOTH: Mm-hmm.
- To remind me    
of the Strangler's MO.    
He always seduced an accomplice into doing his fiendish bidding.    
I bet it was the van driver.    
You mean the woman who was thrown violently from the vehicle and just barely survived?    
Yeah, I'm sure she was very ""badly injured.""    
Sorry if my voice is raspy.    
They just took the breathing tube out.    
- But they left the BS in?
- Good God.    
- Whoa.
- So, Ms. Park, it says in my file that you drove Mr. Zumowski    
- on multiple occasions.
- Yes.    
Because he had to go to the hospital a lot.    
He was very, very old.    
- She's clearly been seduced.
- She has?    
Let's cut the crap.
You helped him escape.    
You planted a cadaver in the back.    
You flipped the van on purpose.    
Then the Strangler set it on fire and sprinkled some of his hair nearby so there'd be a DNA match.    
Then he left behind his calling card: this yo-yo string!    
- That's not a yo-yo string.
- What?    
That's part of the lanyard we give to the older inmates    
- when they become fall risks.
- You're lying.    
You've succumbed to his groovy voodoo!    
Sir, I don't think she's lying.    
Look at this photo from the file.    
Oh, my goodness.    
So this string is just a string?    
The DNA was really a match?    
The Disco Strangler is actually dead.    
And that chapter of my life is forever closed.    
Well, that's... fantastic news.    
Okay, we have you set up here. 
We have a VR experience down the hall where you can fly like a bird, and if you need anything else just buzz and one of our butlers will assist you.    
This place is amazing.
It's like a dream factory.    
We're investigating a sexual assault that occurred in these offices.    
Right, of course. I know.    
This is how people get tempted by the devil.    
I see what you're up to, platter of tiny quiches.    
[sighs] We need to get someone on the record about Seth's patterned behaviors.    
I think if we start with...    
How many tiny quiches do you have in your mouth?    
[muffled] Five. I'll swallow them.    
Let's just start the interviews.    
I don't think something like that would happen here.    
It's an extremely professional workplace, and Seth's a really good guy.    
I don't think he's even ever bought a prostitute before.    
Is that the minimum requirement for being    
- a good guy these days?
- Can I go?    
Beefer's birthday's starting and a bunch of Mets are here.    
Present day or '  ?    
- Both.
- I'm gonna escort him back.    
Yeah, I'm sorry.    
Seth has never been inappropriate with me.    
He's a really good guy.    
Honestly, this is an extremely professional workplace.    
Dude, Beefer just puked in the koi pond.    
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize the cop thing was in here.    
This is an extremely professional workplace, and Seth is a really good guy.    
Hey, I'm Beefer. It's my birthday.    
- Yeah, we heard.
- Happy Birthday, Beefer.    
Beefer's not my real name.    
They just call me that 'cause I beefed on my first day.    
Okay, but for the record, no one asked.    
I don't have anything bad to say about Seth.    
He's a really good guy, and this office is... what's the word?    
- BOTH: Extremely professional.
- Yes!    
Hello, Sergeant Santiago and Detective Peralta.    
I'm the Deputy General Counsel here at the firm.    
I can only assume your questioning has revealed nothing negative about Mr. Haggerty's character.    
Only because you told them exactly what to say.    
We did no such thing.    
These allegations of sexual assault are ridiculous.    
If they're so ridiculous, then why offer Keri Brennan    
- hush money?
- That wasn't hush money.    
That was a benevolent gesture to allow Ms. Brennan to get the professional help she so clearly needs.    
However, since she has chosen to pursue this matter with the police, that deal is now null and void.    
Furthermore, we are terminating her.    
- BOTH: What?
- We have a zero tolerance policy for violence here.    
And unlike Ms. Brennan, Mr. Haggerty has actual evidence of an assault.    
He's talking about my broken pen1s.    
Yeah, Seth, we know.    
Hey, you never came home last night.
You doing okay?    
No, I'm a mess.    
- I miss Hitchcock.
- What?    
I was obviously talking to Amy.    
Oh, and who's talking to Scully?    
No one. Come on, sandwich.    
Ames, you've been working yourself to the bone on this case for three days straight.    
Now, I'm starting to worry about you.    
I have to solve this case, Jake.    
Otherwise Keri lost the settlement and the job that she loves because of me, just like Rosa said.    



[sighs]    
But I can't find anything.    
I've read through three years of Seth's emails, and it's mostly inquiries about where he could buy a Batmobile.    
Tah, so stupid, but did he find one?    
Is it like at a dealership or something? Never mind.    
Look, I know this sucks, and I hate to say it, but we both know sometimes you work a case and you just don't have the evidence.    
This isn't just a case for me.    
When I was a rookie at the Six-Four, my captain was my first mentor.    
He helped me get on the detective track, and he gave me all the best cases.    
But when I finally made detective, he took me to dinner and tried to kiss me.    
He said that he felt like he deserved something in return for my career.    
[voice breaking] I just ran out of the restaurant back to the office, and I put in my transfer for the Nine-Nine.    
Oh, man.    
I'm so sorry.    
I never told anyone because I felt like maybe I didn't actually deserve my promotion.    
And I worried that I wouldn't get anymore promotions if I spoke up, so...    
God.    
Every time I think I understand how bad it is, it's just way worse than I imagined.    
This kind of stuff has happened to literally every woman I know. I just wanted to help make it better for this one woman.    
- Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?    
I'm gonna go get you a change of clothes and a coffee.    
We're not giving up.    
Okay.    
Hey, what if we reach out to all the coworkers again, privately?    
Maybe they didn't talk to us because we interviewed them in their office.    
I think that's a great idea. I'll be right back.    
Oh, I'm also gonna grab a comb, but you don't have to use it unless you decide.    
Okay, babe.    
Sir, you haven't come out of your office in a while.    
- How are you doing?
- Terrible. You were right.    
I was trying to relive my glory years, but the fact remains, they are behind me.    
My only nemesis now...    
Father Time.    
Come on, sir. That's ridiculous.    
You're on the cutting edge.    
In fact, you're so progressive, they were scared to make you Police Commissioner.    
- [machine beeping]
- You're as modern as they come.    
What is that noise?    
- It's my fax machine.
- Oh, Captain.    
- [gasps] Zowie. I'm young!
- What is it?    
It's an aerial photograph from one of the helicopters    
I had deployed. Take a gander, boys.    
It's him. The Disco Strangler.    
Oh, my God. You were right.    
Of course I was. I know him better than anyone.    
- We're two sides of the same...
- ALL: Coin!    
You've told us this story many times.    
And you'll hear it again!    
So we're meeting a guy named Steve.    
He said he couldn't speak openly with us when we met him in the conference room.    
Steve? I don't remember a Steve.    
- Who's Steve?
- I am.    
BOTH: Beefer?    
- So your real name is Steve?
- Yeah, I hate it.    
- Makes me sound like a douche.
- Yeah, Beefer's better.    
So why'd you agree to meet with us?    
I wanted to show you this text chain between Seth and some of the guys in the office.    
Whoa, Seth describes the night exactly like Keri did.    
And then he writes ""LOLZ, Epic Fail.""    
What's this GIF he sent?    
Oh, that's Kelsey Grammer falling off a stage.    
- [laughs, clears throat]
- I was really torn about whether or not I should send this to you guys but then I thought about it for a long time and realized it was the right thing to do.    
Oh, who would have guessed Beefer's a secret feminist.    
No, gross. I meant it was the right thing to do for me.    
- Huh?
- If they fire Seth,    
- I take his job.
- Okay.    
Well, we got what we needed here.    
So I think we're gonna leave before you ruin the moment any further.    
Sweet. I'll send it to ya.    
Thanks for the promosh, narks.    
[scoffs] You're the nark.    
[scoffs]    
- Let's go.
- Yeah.    
All right, people, your suspect's name is Ernest Zumowski, better known as the Disco Strangler.    
Take a close look.    
This is the most dangerous man in America.    
 ' "", hunched over,    pounds with gray hair and blue-gray skin.    
If you encounter him, keep your distance.    
All due respect, sir, seems like a lot of manpower to take down one sweet-looking old man.    
Oh, he's sweet, all right. Sweet as poison pie.    
Yeah, don't underestimate him!    
I know    other people who did that, and they all have yo-yos swinging from their throats.    
- So you were listening.
- Yeah, we were saying that    
- all along.
- Thank you, gentlemen.    
All right, troops. Travel in twos.    
Keep your eyes open, and for God's sake, protect the neck.    
Hey, Keri.    
Great news: the DA's going to press charges against Haggerty.    
I heard. That's awesome. Thank you, guys.    
Hey, what's with the boxes? Moving to a better desk?    
With a better butler and more of those mini quiches?    
No, I'm taking my stuff home. I had to quit.    
BOTH: Whaaat?    
What do you mean, you quit?
Are they forcing you out?    
- Because that's illegal.
- No, they're not.    
But the whole atmosphere here has changed.    
Everybody looks at me like I'm either a victim or a trader.    
I mean, I'm not even on any of the non-work group texts.    
And last night Beefer invited everybody over for whiskey and cigars, and I wasn't included.    
Well, I mean, is not hanging out with Beefer really a punishment, per se?    
Yeah, but if I'm not at Beefer's for whiskey and cigars, then I don't get invited to Vegas with Slurpie and Trundle, and I'm definitely not at Skidmark's pig roast.    
Man, these nicknames are just bad.    
I actually came up with Skidmark.    
It's very funny if you know the back story.    
- He pooped his pants?
- [laughs] Yeah.    
But the point is, if I'm not at those events, then suddenly I'm not looked at for new accounts or promotions or anything. My career here is over.    
I'm really sorry.
I feel like a messed up.    
I shouldn't have talked you into turning down    
- that settlement.
- Hey, Seth attacked me.    
And I'm really proud of myself that I didn't let him get away with that.    
So, even though it sucks, if I had to do it all again,    
I would.    
Especially the broken pen1s.    
- Why'd she say that to me?
- I don't know.    
[sirens wailing]    
[dramatic music] 
Freeze! NYPD!    
Is that Raymond Holt I see?    
You haven't changed a bit.    
- Neither have you, Ernest.
- What?    
[louder] Neither have you, Ernest.    
What?    
Neither have you, Ernest!    
Ugh, this is hard to watch.    
You're just as devious as ever.    
You seduced the van driver, didn't you?    
No, I seduced the van driver.    
She couldn't resist my groovy voodoo.    
And the yo-yo string was a message.    
- The what was a what?
- The yo-yo string was...    
Captain, this is embarrassing.    
Can we just take him in?    
Yeah, you're right.
This isn't what I hoped for.    
Go ahead and cuff him, gently.    
This isn't the last you'll hear from me, Raymond.    
- I'm never gonna die.
- Sure you won't.    
- Whatever makes you feel better.
- No, you're the punk.    
Just put him in the car.    
[elevator dings]    
Hey, heard you guys got that finance creep.    
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.    
But there's nothing to congratulate me about.    
Amy's just upset because the historically entrenched patriarchy has created a culture of victim-shaming that suppresses any power shift in our masculo-phallic system.    
- Huh?
- I couldn't sleep last night so I watched a documentary on Netflix about feminism.    
I love you.    
Just sucks that she came forward to report an assault and the only one who truly benefited    
- is a guy named Beefer.
- You don't know Beefer but...    
Oh, I've met plenty of Beefers.    
- Yeah.
- Look this is a hard fight.    
But it's an important one.    
It's good that you convinced her to press charges.    
But she lost the money, and she had to quit the job she loves.    
That's exactly what you said would happen.    
But you got the guy who assaulted her.    
And look over there.    
- Keri's coworker?
- She came forward to report an assault because she was inspired by Keri, which is exactly what you said would happen.    
Two steps forward, one step back is still one step forward.    
You wanna take her statement together?    
- You know it, sister.
- Yeah, don't do that.    
We can be different and still have the same cause.

Sir, you wanted to see me?  
Yes, I have an assignment for you.  
I'm afraid it's not a pleasant one.  
Oh, my God. Please tell me it's not...  
Yes, it's Hitchcock related.  
Son of a bitch.  
Detective Hitchcock is set to testify in court this afternoon.  
It's an important case, and I'd rather not get another call from the DA saying he showed up ""covered in condiments.""   
So you want me to keep Hitchcock from spilling on himself for the rest of the day?   
We both know that's impossible.   
- I'm counting on you.
- I won't do it.   
- There's nobody else I trust.
- What you're asking is insane.   
- I'm not asking.
- It's a suicide mission!   
- Then prepare for death.
- You've lost your mind!   
This is a direct order, Detective!
Get in line!   
Hey. You guys startled Hitchcock.   
He spilled two full jars of spaghetti sauce on himself.   
Thanks a lot, fellas.

♪ ♪ 
Ames, super important question.   
Which one of these shirts should I wear to dinner   
- with your mom tonight?
- Those are exactly the same.   
I have a signature look, Rosa.   
Put on a T-shirt for all I care.   
It doesn't matter what you wear.   
Of course it matters.   
He has to wear the smaller checks.   
Big checks wash him out. Where are you, Amy?   
It doesn't matter, because the night is already ruined.   
My stupid mother invited my stupid brother David to join us.   
I thought you liked your brothers.   
I have seven brothers, Rosa,   
and I like all of them except David.   
Perfect David.   
David graduated at the top of his class at the police academy.   
David took a bullet for the mayor.   
David bakes his own bread.   
Ooh, and does this David have a sister?   
- Yes. Amy is his sister.
- And what's her deal?   
You were at the wedding, Hitchcock.   
I'm just gonna call and cancel.   
I really don't want to have dinner with my mom fawning all over the golden boy.   
I'm sure your mom loves you both equally.   
No, she definitely doesn't.   
My parents arrange the photos of their kids by who makes them the proudest.   
Number one goes on the mantel above the fireplace, two through four on the piano, and the rest   
- are on the staircase.
- This is wack.   
- So David's on the mantel?
- Always.   
Meanwhile, my picture gathers dust on the piano.   
- The piano's not that bad.
- Nobody in the family even plays, Rosa.   
At least people use the stairs.   
All right, David is perfect, but so are you.   
Let's just go tonight, and I'll be your hype man.   
You know how good I am at talking you up.   
Here, watch. Hey, Scully.   
Did you know that Amy is super cool?   
No way. Can I get your autograph, ma'am?   
- See?
- Fine, we'll go.   
What, too stuck up for your fans?   
Ya friggin' turd!   
Hey, Captain, Sarge, I have a case I want to discuss with you.   
You want to talk about work in the break room?   
That's highly unorthodox, but I suppose we can give it a try.   
Okay, so I have a perp...   
I'm sorry, this is insane.
Let's talk in my office.   
Much better. All right, Boyle, what's this case you wanted to talk about?   
I have a perp, Alfonso Tucker, transferring into our holding cell.   
The guy who was dealing that toxic batch of meth?   
Yeah, and he refuses to name his supplier.   
I want to send someone into holding, undercover as a perp, to see if they can get him to open up.   
Why don't you do it?   
You're always going on about your acting abilities and that time you played Annie.   
I'm an adult man, Sarge.
I didn't play Annie.   
I was in ""Annie.""
I played Miss Hannigan.   
Unfortunately, Alfonso knows I'm a cop, so I can't be Maxwell Blaze.   
But Terry might be right for the role.   
Ooh, that sounds fun.   
I love flexing my creative muscles.   
In addition to flexing my actual muscles.   
- Or I could do it.
- What? You hate theater.   
You always say acting is just professional lying.   
Yes, but this is what the mission calls for, and I'm good at it.    
Kevin and I went to a dinner party where we played the French parlor game ""charades.""    
I had to act out Elvis Presley.    
♪ ♪ 
He's dead now, so I portrayed him as such.    
Everyone understood...    
[snaps fingers] Immediately.    
You know, a little competition might bring out the best in both of you.    
We'll hold auditions this afternoon.    
I'll prepare sides.    
Please wear clothes you can move in.    
Okay, let's get to the table before David gets here.    
My mother loves an early bird.    
Hey, babe, before we go in,    
I know I said I was gonna do the whole hype man thing, but...    
I know.    
I shouldn't compare myself to my brother.    
We're all on our own journey.    
What? No. Who told you that garbage?    
I was gonna say, we need a backup plan so you can win this thing.    
If it starts slipping away, I'll pretend to choke, and then you give me the Heimlich and save my life in front of everyone.    
Aw, thanks for not trying to make me a better person.    
- I love you.
- Love you too.    
Amy, Jake!    
David and I both arrived an hour early.    
We're sharing a French onion.    
Mother...    
So she's about to jump, and I say,    
""Hey, I can't tell you this world is a good place, but I guarantee you it's better with you in it.""    
And she climbs down off the ledge,    
- and she gives me a big hug.
- Ugh.    
And that was before she won the Oscar?    
I don't know, I don't really follow pop culture.    
You never cease to impress me, David.    
Hey, speaking of impressive, Amy just went to the NYPD shooting range and received a gold certification in marksmanship.    
Oh, I just got the platinum certification.    
What? That exists? What did you do, curve the bullets, ""Wanted""-style?    
Yeah, I don't know what ""Wanted"" is. I don't follow pop culture.    
But I fired ten shots, and they all went into the same hole.    
Oh, so you actually did.    
Hey, Camila, did you know that Amy is the youngest female sergeant in the history of the Nine-Nine?    
Yes, I'm very proud of her.    
I'm proud of all my children.    
The sergeant and the lieutenant.    
What? You passed the lieutenant's exam?    
It actually wasn't something I was planning on taking, but then my partner got sick and I wanted to be able to send home extra money to his wife and kids.    
Then I read the MRI.
He was totally misdiagnosed.    
So long story short, Bo is alive, and I got a perfect score on the test for no reason.    
Oh, man.    
Hey, check out these dinner rolls, huh?    
Love these bad boys.    
I'm just gonna chomp down on that, recklessly.    
[mimics choking]    
Oh! Oh, no, Jake! He's choking!    
Let David do it. He has EMT training.    
- I'm here for you, Jake.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.    
[exclaims] You know what...    
Don't worry. It is gonna hurt like hell.    
I think it's actually okay.    
[grunting]    
Thank you both so much for coming in.    
This is a safe space where choices are welcome.    
Okay, now, I trust that both of you had a chance to review the script?    
- Yeah.
- Good. Now throw them away!    
What the hell?
I wrote notes in the margin.    
Terry found his super-objective.    
I want to see you improvise without the safety net.    
I want to see you become Maxwell Blaze.    
So, Maxwell, what was your childhood like?    
I was a lookout at  , had my own corner at   , trigger man at   .    
You know what it's like to look a man in his eyes as the life drains out of him?    
I was bad from a young age.    
At school, I pushed people.    
And this wasn't horseplay. This was pushing to hurt.    
Do you have a girlfriend at home?    
Used to. She got tired of me getting locked up.    
She's with my brother now.    
He better hope I never find his ass.    
I do, and you should see her heavy, feminine breasts, with their perfectly placed nipples.    
Don't get me started on her can.    
- What's your greatest fear?
- I ain't scared of nothing.    
My girlfriend. I'm scared she'll find out about my mistress, who also has a perfect can.    
It's smaller, but it's harder.    
Great.    
You both have given me something totally different.    
I've got a lot to think about.    
Thank you. Next!    
What up, dawgs?    
Norm Scully, reading for Maxwell Blaze.    
Listen, I just did what anyone would do.    
Hey, where'd you go?    
I just couldn't stand there while the whole restaurant gushed over David saving your life.    
Yeah, there was a standing ovation.    
Also, everyone saw you walk away while I was choking, and I don't want to say you're a villain now, but the B-word was tossed around a lot.    
Ugh. I'm sorry.    
I just can't be around him.    
- I shouldn't have come.
- So let's leave.    
I'll tell everyone my stomach hurts, which it does.    
I'm pretty sure he broke my rib when he gave me the Heimlich.    
Lieutenant Santiago, a word?    
Why is David's captain here?    
What's going on? Is there a maniac on the loose, and David's the only one who can catch him before he blows up a train?    
Oh, we could call him the Trainiac.    
We're focused on the same things.    
Sorry, folks, we've discovered a large quantity of cocaine in Lieutenant Santiago's desk.    
We've had to place him under arrest.    
Oh, no.    
Of course. We'll head over soon.    
So that was my brother.    
He needs me to bail him out of jail.    
I feel so awful for him.    
You are smiling so much.    
No, no, I promise. I feel so, so, bad.    
Rosa D!    
- Deezer, what up?
- Deezer?    
Hey, Scully, did you do something new with your hair?    
Same thing as always: put mousse in it while it's wet, then I watch a scary movie.    
- [chuckles] You the man.
- What is wrong with her?    
Her brother David got arrested.    
- He's a cokehead!
- And you're happy about this?    
That's savage. I love it.    
- I'm not happy about it!
- All right.    
Calm down, Littlefinger.    
He's in a lot of trouble, you know.    
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.    
It's a terrible situation.    
- Let's go bail him out.
- All right.    
Ooh, should I get my hair blown out first?    
I'm gonna have pictures from today for the rest of my life.    
Are you... a bad person?    
Casting's up!    
This is not a high school play, Boyle.    
Just let us know who you went with.    
Okay, first of all,    
I want to say that this was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make.    
There is so much talent in this room.    
Just tell us, bitch.    
Act as if you already have the role.    
I could have cast any one of you and put on a great show, but I had to make a call.    
Enough, Boyle. We're all adults.    
No one cares about this that much.    
- It's Captain Holt.
- Captain Holt?    
He was the worst one!    
No offense, but Holt was so unconvincing.    
He kept referring to his childhood as a soot-covered street urchin.    
Yes, I gave myself a Dickensian backstory, which apparently made quite the impression.    
I'm sorry, Sarge.    
Honestly, I don't think I'm the right director to bring your vision of Maxwell Blaze to life.    
What does that even mean?    
It means you blew it.    
Walk away, Jeffords. Walk away.    
Okay, this is gonna be my mantel shot.    
So every time Mom and Dad look at it,    
they'll be reminded of what David did.    
I would say you should chill out, but this is actually making me feel great about my family, so let's dive in.    
Everybody say ""possession with intent to distribute""!    
Hey.    
- Oh!
- Ah, David, hi there.    
That was unrelated to your recent arrest for possession with intent to distribute.    
- How are you?
- Not great.    
Yeah, jail is rough.    
You got to go poop in front of everyone.    
I remember when I was in prison,    
I held it for weeks, and when I finally did go, it was...    
You know what, Jake?
This isn't about you.    
So, David, did you get fired, or is there gonna be, like, a hearing?    
She's asking so she can be there to support you.    
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.    
- I'm so excited.
- To support you.    
That's what I said.
I'm really looking forward    
- to being there.
- To support you.    
Yeah, we're saying the same thing.    
- I am pumped this is happening.
- All right, babe, maybe your brother doesn't want to talk about what happened.    
- Let's just go.
- It's okay.    
I owe you guys an explanation.    
I actually started doing drugs when I was a teenager.    
You know how Mom and Dad put so much pressure on us?    
Eventually I just kind of cracked.    
Wait, you felt pressure?    
You always seemed to effortlessly thrive at everything. I was so jealous.    
But knowing that you also felt the pressure...    
All right, we can drop the act. I just didn't know who was listening.    
- What act, now?
- Everything I've said before just now is a lie. I'm being framed.    
I've been investigating these dirty cops who are being paid off by the Brazilian mob.    
Oh, Brazilian mobsters are so good-looking.    
They're just a bunch of Giseles, the women and the men.    
Yes, it's insane. They're all gorgeous.    
Anyway, I think I got too close.    
Those dirty cops must have planted the drugs in my desk.    
So what you're saying is, you're not addicted to cocaine?    
Amy, it's me. I don't even drink coffee.    
I have too much respect for my body.    
This is water.    
And you didn't feel pressure    
- from Mom and Dad?
- No, they're so supportive.    
I'd actually love some constructive criticism.    
It's the only way to grow.    
Anyway, thank you so much for bailing me out.    
If you can just drop me off at home, I will clear my name, and things can go back to the way they were.    
The way they were. Great.    
It's my favorite way of things being.    
Okay, Alfonso, I hope you like it here in holding.    
It's gonna be a while.    
[door closes]    
So...    
- what they got you in here for?
- Drugs.    
They want me to flip, but I'm no snitch.    
I'd rather do the time. How about you?    
I pushed a man, just to see him frown.    
[laughs] He is terrible.    
Yeah, it's almost like casting a robotic old nerd was a huge mistake.    
Was it a mistake, Sarge?    
Or was it a stroke of brilliance?    
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you're a good actor.    
You could even be a great one. But you're too gentle.    
Life hasn't kicked you around enough.    
I mean, I grew up poor, and my father was emotionally abusive.    
It's not enough.    
You needed to be rejected by me, a man you admire so much.    
What? So all this was just to make me mad?    
I need you to feel the anger and resentment that Tyrone McCallister feels every single day of his life.    
Who's Tyrone McCallister?    
You are.    
That's the part I wrote for you all along.    
This is so stupid, Boyle.    
You can't manipulate somebody like this and then expect them to get on board.    
Right, Sarge?    
Sarge?    
My name's Tyrone.    
Tyrone McGallagher.    
- McCallister.
- McCallister.    
So I checked up on David's case file.    
He passed his drug test.    
Apparently he has the cleanest blood they've ever seen.    
I knew this was all too good to be true.    
Now David's gonna clear his name and singlehandedly take down drug dealers and dirty cops and get another medal from the governor.    
It sounds pretty dangerous.
Maybe we should help him.    
Pretty sure he can handle this on his own.    
That's never been a problem for him.    
All right, look, Ames.    
I never had a brother, but I know four guys who did, and they would have fights and squabbles, but in the end, they always had each other's shells.    
Are you talking about the Ninja Turtles?    
Of course I'm talking about    
- the Ninja Turtles!
- Ugh.    
Look, if something happens to your brother, you are gonna regret it, just like Raph regretted it when he abandoned Leo in the Technodrome with Krang.    
I don't know what that means.    
Well, that's on you. It's a classic.    
The point is, if your brother gets hurt and you don't get his back now, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.    
[sighs] You're right.    
- Obviously you're right.
- Thank you.    
If David gets killed by the Brazilian mafia, my parents' mantel is gonna become, like,    
- a permanent shrine to him.
- No, that's not what I meant.    
Oh, the thought of it makes me want to puke.    
You've learned the wrong lesson.    
Come on, let's go help the b*st*rd.    
Don't love how we got here, but we're going where I want.    
I'm glad you guys are here.    
So this place is run by the Brazilian mob.    
My CI tells me there's a ledger with all the cops on payroll hidden in here somewhere.    
I'm guessing it's in that room surrounded by armed guards.    
Those are guards?    
I thought they were models.    
We need a plan to get past them.    
So here's what I'm thinking. I speak a little Portuguese from that time I opened a school in the favelas of Rio.    
- Ugh, barf.
- What?    
I said barf.    
I can't deal with your bragging anymore.    
How is that bragging?    
I said I speak a little Portuguese when I'm actually fluent.
[speaks Portuguese]    



Ugh, shut up!    
Look, if you're so angry with me, why are you even here?    
Because Jake convinced me if you die,    
I'd never hear the end of it from Mom and Dad.    
That's not exactly how I phrased it.    
Look, I get it. You're jealous.    
I'd be jealous too if someone was better than me at everything their whole life.    
- Oh, no.
- [scoffs] Not everything.    
- I have more allergies than you.
- Not the best brag.    
I have so many allergies, I just found out    
- I'm allergic to chia seeds.
- But apparently effective.    
I'm allergic to chia and acai berries.    
Yeah? My throat gets scratchy when I eat stone fruit.    
Oh, yeah? I'm also a better dancer than you.    
Ames, you have badly misjudged your own abilities.    
You think you're better than me?    
Oh, damn.    
She's got a shot.    
What, afraid to use your forearms?    
Pretty good.    
You're not using enough elbow!    
Guys, those aren't the parts people feature when they dance.    
Now can we please find a way to distract those guards?    
Don't worry, Jake, 'cause I'm about to end this thing.    
Death drop!    
[grunts] Ow!    
Ow, ow, ow!    
- Oh, that looked really bad.
- Are you okay?    
Oh, look, the guards are leaving their post.    
Looks like they're coming here to help you.    
Jake, you should go now.    
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm ""fone.""    
Oh, well, as long as you're ""fone.""    
- Jake, go.
- All right, fine.    
Believe me, they're perfect. 
They're about    /  pounds each, and they look so good smushed together.    
Or dangling.    
[door opens]    
Get off me, man.    
- Hey.
- Hey.    
- Hey.
- Cops, man.    
- Mm-hmm.
- Word.    
McCallister, your lawyer's here.    
- He wants to talk to you.
- Already?    
What the hell, man?
I was just getting started.    
And yet it felt like forever.    
You were playing at Alfonso, not with Alfonso.    
What are you doing right now, Sarge?    
- Listening to you?
- Yes, listening.    
What humans do   % of the time and Tyrone does, apparently, none of the time.    
I want you to go back in there and listen.    
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah, okay, jeez.    
I mean, you know, look, take the note about Tyrone or don't.    
What do I know? But also, I created him.    
[sighs]    
Hey.    
[door opens]    
McCallister, your lawyer has more questions for you.    
- What?
- Why were you doing that?    
You said I should listen!    
Well, listening doesn't always mean being quiet.    
Sometimes, the only way to listen is to say something.    
I'm listening to you right now.    
Do you see how I listen?
This is me listening.    
You're pissing me off, Boyle!    
Ah, and he's back!
Hold on to that aggression.    
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!    
[clapping]    
What are you looking at?    
McCallister.    
Terry, Terry, Terry.    
I need you to help me see what I'm not seeing.    
Why can't you do this?    
You're giving me too many notes.    
Okay, well, then I can boil it down for you into one note:    
Tyrone is an ocean.    
I don't know what that means.    
It means I want you to be tough but vulnerable, brave but scared, jittery but perfectly still.

McCallister, I need to talk to you.    
- No!

Amy, I'm sorry for getting so competitive back there.    
You guys are helping me out, and I should just be grateful.    
Of course you're being nice to me when I'm being a monster.    
Well, you know what, Mr. Perfect?    
I'm gonna find that ledger, and I'm gonna save your stupid butt.    
- That would be so great.

Hey, Boyle, I did what you asked.    
Alfonso told me everything.    
Yes! I knew it would work.    
What? What's going on?    
You were never my real star, Sarge.    
But I needed to create a scene so that Alfonso would think that my mission had failed.    
Then I could send in...

You've executed this mission flawlessly. I'm impressed.    
Wait, if you were gonna use Diaz the whole time, why didn't you just tell us that?

When you grow up, nobody thinks skateboarders are cool.""  
What's cool is having your own pants.

Easy. No one pushed Boyle down the stairs.    
Right. We may have plastered his eyes shut and left him to wander around blindly, but he fell down on his own.

Or masked with animal urine.

Okay, how about this? Gintars just wants to see him, right?    
We can maybe have them meet without telling Nikolaj that Gintars is his birth father.    
Just say he's an old friend of ours.    
Jake, you're completely forgetting about the olfactory bond.

You should leave before... Hello, Dr. Yee!    
Out back now.    
Captain Holt, nice to see you again.    
Please, call me Raymond.    
Unless that feels weird.
You don't have to.    
I'll answer to anything.    
Raymond works.    
So I understand you have a potential crime scene, and you'd like to find some blood.    
Well, I've brought along several hundred of my best detectives to help out.    
Oh, my God. I'm starstruck.    
We all are.    
So what you made you think of using drosophila as a method of searching for blood traces?    
Have you ever read Sung Tz'u's textbook    
- ""The Washing Away of Wrongs"" from     ?
- Nope.    
- Yes.
- Which edition?    
It tells the story of the first known use of forensic entomology.    
A farmer was slashed to death.    
A local judge asked everyone in the town to lay down their sickles.    
And though they all appeared clean, one attracted a horde of flies.    
The insects could sense the blood, even though it was invisible to the human eye.    
Wow, what an arresting story.    
Yes, they did arrest him.    
[laughter]    
We made a joke together.    
[laughter]    
Okay, Dr. Yee, how effective is your box of bugs?    
Oh, well, in a lab, they've detected blood even when it's been cleaned with bleach.    
BOTH: Or covered with animal urine!    
You two really know your stuff.    
[laughter]    
[groaning]    
I know that sound.    
That's the moaning of a man who left his lunch on the bus.    
I didn't lose my lunch, you idiot.    
I lost my son!    
Okay, Scully, I got this.    
Hey there, bud.    
I got you your favorite tea:    
- duck broth.
- Thanks.    
You know me so well.    
But I'm too sad to drink duck broth.    
Wow, I never thought I'd hear you or anyone say that.    
Nikolaj is asking if Gintars is really his dad.    
I worked so hard to have him think of me as his father.    
And now it's all ruined.    
He'll probably go back to calling me what he did when I first adopted him: Mr. America.    
I know you're upset, but that is a dope nickname.    
I'm not Mr. America.    
- I'm Daddy.
- Of course you are.    
[sighs] I just don't want Nikolaj to see him again.    
I don't want him turning into a Gintars.    
You have nothing to worry about.    
Nikolaj is already a mini Charles.    
He's an eight-year-old boy whose favorite movie is ""Bullets Over Broadway.""    
So what are you saying? I should let him spend time with Gintars?    
I just worry that if you prevent him from knowing his birth father, that he'll build up some fantasy of him and then blame you for keeping them apart.    
That's crazy.    
The way that King Trident kept Ariel from exploring the surface.    
Oh, my God, you're right.    
I'm driving Nikolaj into the arms of a sea witch.    
Watching him work is amazing.    
Mm-hmm.    
- I have to get a video.
- Santiago, please.    
Hold the phone horizontal to get more flies in frame.    
All right, guys, this fanboy stuff is a little much.    
The only thing that's a little much over here are your scrawled-on eyebrows.    
- Yeesh.
- Seriously?    
- I thought they worked.
- They do... if you wanna look like a mean drag queen.    
I knew I should have done a flatter arch.    
This is a nighttime look.    
Well, the flies are not reacting.    
I can keep going, but I'll tell you now, it's very unlikely there are any traces of blood in here.    
Well, according to my timeline, this is the only place the murder could have happened.    
Sorry, Rosa, looks like your timeline's wrong.    
Because the flies don't lie.    
You can use that if you want.    
He's not gonna use a cheeky slogan.    
- He's a man of science.
- I like it.    
The flies don't lie.    
Okay, Dr. Yee, exactly how accurate is this technology?    
Diaz, how dare you question the man.    
Dr. Yee has spent millions of dollars developing and researching these flies.    
It's fine. Would you all like to see what happens when they actually sense blood?    
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.    
Will you hold this, Ally?    
[flies buzzing]    
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, Detective Diaz,    
I know it's upsetting when a hunch doesn't pan out.    
Well, it's over. The flies have it.    
Keep your eyes on the flies.    
Flies don't lie.    
Now, that's a good one.    
Oh, no, it's Santiago's. Damn it.    
Wow, this was a bad idea.    
Relax. He gets one afternoon with Nikolaj, and he chooses basketball?    
Does Nikolaj even like basketball?    
He loves the ""Get Your Head In The Game"" number from ""High School Musical.""    
I haven't seen it, but I know that's not the same.    
Look at them. Does it seem like he's actually enjoying this?    
Porzingas!    
Charles, can I tell you a story?    
- Always.
- All right.    
When I was   , my dad started dating this woman, Leeza.    
My mom hated her.    
But my dad wanted us to bond, so one day he took me and Leeza to the mall and dropped us off.    
She proceeds to steal a ton of blouses from Ann Taylor and then immediately makes me go back in and exchange them for store credit.    
Then to celebrate, I get to pull Leeza's Cinnabon apart because her nails are too long and curly to do it herself.    
- Ugh.
- Point being, nothing has ever made me love my own mother more than the time I spent with Leeza.    
Gintars is Leeza.    
You are my mom.    
I can't believe I get to be Karen.    
What an honor!    
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, sweetie?    
- Can we leave?
- Oh, no, so soon?    
But I understand. We can go home right now.    
No, not home. Daddy Gintars wants to buy me a jean jacket just like his.    
Daddy Gintars.    
Daddy Gintars.    
Oh, no.    
I am Leeza.    
Wait. No. That's not right.    
[moaning]    
Hey, bud.    
Everything going okay in here?    
I know you're going through something, but people are starting to complain about the moaning.    
Ugh. I would give anything to have Gintars gone and out of Nikolaj's life.    
But it's not gonna happen.    
Okay, well, I'm just gonna close the door, then.    
And you can feel free to moan as much as you need.    
[moaning]    
[sighs] This is bad.    
I know. He's been like that all day.    
No, I was talking about your eyebrows.    
Whatever's going on up there is real, real bad.    
Well, it's better than having two bug hotels above your eyes.    
But wouldn't they also be in your goatee?    
- Don't do this to me, Jake.
- Wait a minute.    
I may have just thought of a way to get rid of Gintars.    
Do you still have that friend who works on the Counterfeiting Taskforce?    
Yeah, why?    
Gintars has this terrible knock-off clothing brand called The Gape.    
If I can get him to admit on tape that he's selling counterfeit goods, they would terminate his visa and deport him.    
Deport him?    
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?    
Yeah, definitely, but Charles just said he'd give anything for Gintars to be gone.    
[moaning]    
- He's not doing great, Terry.
- Okay.    
But how are you gonna get Gintars on tape?    
Good question, Sergeant Crazy Brows.    
Gintars is always talking about the Russian baths.    
I'll see if he'll meet me there and then ask him to cut me in on his business.    
Meanwhile, I'll have a mic hidden underneath my towel.    
It's foolproof.    
Before we do deal, we take off towel.    
It's full naked.    
Ha.    
What are you waiting for?    
I want to see where your hair starts and stops.    
[laughs] Gintars.    
- [both chuckle]
- Take it off now.    
Heh.    
Hey, Sarge.    
Holy crap. What the hell is that?    
That is a bug-free zone is what it is.    
I bleached it.    
I'm smarter than they are, Rosa.    
Uh-huh. What about your nose hair?    
Oh, man. Terry forgot about his nose.    
Hey, why is Yee still here?    
Holt wants him to hand in his case report in person.    
I think he's trying to trick him into going to lunch with him.    
Wait. It's noon?    
If I didn't know better, I'd say that was lunchtime.    
I hope they take that container of bugs with them    
- when they go.
- Wait. The container's here?    
I have an idea.
All I need is some blood.    
This is fresh.    
Oh. Terrible, yet perfect.

Stupid bugs didn't do anything.    
He lied to us, Sarge.    
[nose hair clipper whirs]    
Huh?    
Why's your towel still on?    
This is business conversation.    
You cannot trust a man who cannot show you his full self.    
Well, not in America.    
Here we have business meetings fully clothed.    
Sometimes even in a suit and tie.    
Have you ever seen the show ""Shark Tank""?    
Latvian ""Shark Tank"" is all nude.    
That sounds weirdly sexy.    
No, not at all.    
There's no female sharks, so it's just four Mr. Wonderfuls naked    
on a big leather couch.    
Huh. Not what I imagined.    
[clears throat] Hey, listen.    
I would love to buy some of that knock-off denim.    
Okay, first of all, it's not knock-off.    
Okay, Gape is true, authentic brand.    
The real thief is Gap.    
- Are they?
- What makes more sense?    
That they take Gape and remove letter?    
Or that I take Gap and add pricey E?    
I don't care if it's fake, I just wanna buy some.    
It's not fake; you are still wearing a towel; and this deal: over.    
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.    
Do you wanna know why I won't take off my towel?    
It's because I'm embarrassed... about what's underneath.    
Mutilated pen1s?    
Ye... p.    
That is it. You guessed it on the first try.    
That's what's under there.
The old... the old... mute peen.    
I am so sorry about your pen1s.    
It's a bummer.    
But we all have things that bring us shame.    
Remember when I told you before that Gape was original, authentic brand?    
I do. It was just now.    
Yeah, well...    
I stole the whole thing from Gap.    
[scoffs] And here I was completely believing you when you told me you didn't.    
Wow.    
Well, thank you for sharing that with me.    
You are freak.    
But I support you. Come.    
Oh, no, it's a naked hug.    
Ha ha. Ah.    
Hey, what's up? You guys having a little coffee? That's cool.    
- Yee's a fraud.
- What?    
Excuse me?    
Those nasty-ass bugs don't smell blood.    
And they must not smell bullcrap, either, 'cause he's spewing it everywhere.    
What are you saying out of your weird face?    
We put the flies near fresh blood, and nothing happened.
They didn't react at all.    
Do you know how stupid these accusations sound?    
- Diaz, you're fired.
- What?    
Dr. Yee is one of the most respected forensic experts in the country.    
For you two... let's not mince words... common fools to suggest that you found the flaw    
- in this brilliant man's...
- They're right.    
- What?
- Huh?    
The flies don't sense blood.    
They're just regular flies.    
But, Dr. Yee, you can't be a fraud.    
You gave a TED Talk.    
I spent $  million in federal grant money on this experiment and I've gotten nowhere.    
The closest I ever came was when they all landed on a Popsicle once.    
But in the apartment we saw them react to a cotton swab    
- dipped in blood.
- It was melted Popsicle.    
- [gasps]
- Jam works, too, but it's more expensive.    
So, Sir, you were saying something about us being common fools?    
So who looks stupid now?    
Uh, Terry, your left eyebrow is missing.    
Oh, I must have rubbed it off.    
There it is.    
Who looks stupid now?    
Jake, hey, I got it, man.    
Nice jeans, and the good thing is look... both legs, same length.    
Thank you very much.    
And I see it's    % denim-ish.    
""Caution: Do not wear near women who are pregnant

Hey, guys. Gintars said to meet him here.    
I didn't realize you were coming.    
My man, I'ma wrestle you. Come here.    
Charles, what are you doing here?    
Why is Nikolaj here?    
Oh, he's been so happy since he met Gintars.    
I've been focusing on myself and not really thinking about Nikolaj.    
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't realize how much it meant to him to know he hadn't been abandoned.    
I'm okay with them having a relationship.    
Wow, that is so great of you, Charles, but I really wish you'd included me in your decision-making process.    
- Why?
- No reason.    
I just maybe went in a different,less-mature direction.    
[sirens wailing]    
Hey, maybe we should leave this area, like, right now.    
Cop car. How's it going?    
Hey, man.    
Gintars Irbe, you're under arrest for selling counterfeit goods.    
Jake! You set me up.    
Do you even have mutilated pen1s?    
[sighs]    
No.    
It's perfect.    
Okay.    
So they're taking Gintars to the airport and they're not hurting him... any more than they did when he was resisting arrest.    
- [taser zapping]
- [yells]    
Now they won't let him go just because I asked them to even though they arrested him just because I asked them to.    
It's a crazy system. I don't understand it.    
But here's what I'm thinking:    
- I call the State Department...
- You've done enough, Jake.    
That's nice of you to say, but...    
- My tone wasn't nice.
- But your tone is always nice with me.    
Wait a minute. Are you mad?    
Yes, because you butted into a situation you shouldn't have.    
You need to keep your butt in your pants.    
My butt was only out because you said you wanted Gintars gone.    
Well, thanks to your butt, Nikolaj feels like he's been abandoned all over again.    
Okay, but my butt was the one that got them together in the first place.    
I don't feel like my butt is getting credit for that.    
Well, that's because your butt was inappropriate then too.    
Your butt should have never been a part of this.    
So now I gotta go clean up the big nasty mess that your butt made.    
But my butt no but...    
My butt no but!    
Diaz, Jeffords,    
Santiago would like to apologize to you for her behavior.    
I thought we were both apologizing.    
No, I misunderstood.    
What would I be apologizing for?    
- The same thing as me?
- Really?    
You guys maybe want to have this conversation on your own?    
Yes.    
- Okay, we have come to a decision that we would both like to apologize.    
We should have trusted your instincts over Dr. Yee and his flies.    
And?    
And we shouldn't have been so insulting.    
And?    
I'm not gonna apologize for your face.    
That mess is clearly on you.    
- Fair enough.
- I'll ask Commissioner Kelly to approve your initial request for an FBI lab team.    
That won't be necessary. I solved the case.    
And the flies actually came in handy.    
These have been genetically engineered to detect blood, and there's a whole swarm of them at your apartment right now with Dr. Ronald Yee.    
The flies don't lie.    
- He confessed immediately.
- How about that.    
Dr. Yee and his flies saved the day after all.    
No, I did.    
Should we call Yee and tell him the good news?    
[sighs] It would probably make him feel so much better.    
- What is going on?
- He did seem so sad.    
- So sad.
- He should be sad. He's a fraud.    
Shh. It's ringing.    
Hey.    
Hey.    
Did you make it to the airport in time to see Gintars?    
Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him stay in the country.    
At least Nikolaj got to spend a few hours with his birth father at a Chili's Too.    
Chili's As Well.    
[chuckles]    
Listen, I feel bad, and I wanted to do something but I know you didn't want my help, so long story short, I made us these hats.    
I obviously love them.    
They don't change how I'm feeling.    
Okay.    
Well, I'm sorry that I messed things up.    
But I was just trying to be a good friend.    
I know, but that doesn't always mean fixing my life.    
You shouldn't have done anything without asking me.    
Sometimes I just want you to listen.    
Right.    
I hear that.    
It's just... adoption is complicated.    
No matter how much I want to be, I'm not Nikolaj's real father.    
Come on, Charles. Of course you are.    
Well, that'll be up to him.    
And he may even change his mind about it throughout his life.    
I mean, all I can do is make him feel safe and give him as much love as I can.    
Well, I think Nikolaj is very lucky to have you.    
- Nikolaj.
- [laughs]    
Okay. Let's take these hats out for a spin.    
I've waited long enough.    
Here you go. Best Bud # .    
You'd rather be Best Bud # ?    
I just want you to listen a little more.    
I don't wanna change our whole dynamic.    
Okay, good, 'cause I really wanted to be Best Bud # .

Jakey, I've got a hot case for you. 
Ooh, hit me. 
Okay, Susan Buckley was reported missing by her psychiatrist, Dr. William Tate.   
He thinks that her husband James may have had a mental break and done something terrible to her.   
Ooh, that is a hot case.   
Missing woman, psycho husband, creepy shrink.   
Dr. Tate was actually quite a nice man.   
Yeah, but you know, he's a psychiatrist, so he's automatically a creep. I've seen movies.   
They all turn into super sophisticated, Chianti-loving cannibals.   
Wait, have you never been to therapy?   
- No. Don't need it.
- Not even after the time   
- your wife shot you?
- Nope.   
What about when you were held at gunpoint and had to write your own suicide note?   
Oh, that was crazy. I forgot about that.   
Or when you were falsely accused of bank robbery   
- and went to prison?
- Was that a big deal?   
You joined a gang and tried meth!   
I didn't want to be anyone's bitch.   
Look, it sounds like these things affected you more than they affected me.
Maybe you should go to therapy.

I go twice a week.
Couples counseling with my dad,and then a solo sesh with Dr. Tyler.   
Okay, unlike Kooky Charles and Tearful Terry,

Anyway, I wanted to invite you and Jocelyn to dinner at my house this weekend.   
Kevin will be making his famous rice.   
Thank you for the invite, but I'm not really having people meet Jocelyn yet.   
I'm still feeling things out with her.   
But Boyle says you brought Jocelyn to Shaw's last week.   
That was unplanned.   
Sure, but now that the squad has all met her, surely you can't object to her having some rice with Kevin and me?   
Okay, it's just that you can be a bit... judgmental.   
What a stupid thing to say.   
Name one time when I have been judgmental.   
- Okay.
- What a stupid thing to say.   
Oh, I see. Mere seconds ago.   
Sir, Jocelyn is not like us.   
- She has feelings.

That is exactly the type of thing I don't want you to say in front of her.   
Sorry. It's not gonna happen.

Hey, Sarge, I heard you need some s*x tips.    
Except for the people I already told.    
Here's the big one: just lie flat on your back.    
- Women love to do all the work.
- Ugh.    
That's very incorrect, and I don't need s*x tips!    
Okay, we'll just leave the book here, and whoever did order it can take it when nobody's looking.

Yes, he does have a normal man's face, stretched out over his own face, because he is a Hannibal.    
Hi there. Dr. Tate, I presume.    
Yes. Hi, nice to meet you.    
Uh, which one of you is in charge?    
- Let the mind games begin.
- Excuse me?    
Sorry, I am Detective Peralta.    
This is Detective Boyle. He's in charge.    
Dr. Tate, have you heard anything from Mrs. Buckley?    
No, I haven't, and I'm quite worried.    
I received a frantic, disturbing call from James yesterday.    
He was afraid he'd done something horrible.    
I asked him where he was, and he said he was in the park near the Zen garden.    
I suspected he was just experiencing delusions, but when they didn't show up for therapy today, I became very concerned.    
So you think he killed her and dumped her body in the park?    
Sounds like couples counseling is going really great for them.    
Sorry, my partner doesn't believe in therapy.    
Oh, that's fine.
It's hard for some people.    
Title of your s*x tape. [exclaims]    
Are you normally so cavalier around murder investigations?    
Yes, we see a lot of darkness in our line of work, and humor is one of our coping mechanisms.    
It's self-preservation through disassociation.    
What the [bleep]?    
It's something I've been working on with my therapist.    
Well, I act like this because I'm cool and fun and people like being around me.    
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to trigger you.    
Okay, Doc, you're not in your office.    
You don't have to use words like ""triggered"" or ""in denial.""    
I didn't say ""in denial.""
Are you in denial?    
No, I am not, and before you say anything,    
I don't want to sleep with my mom either.    
Now, why would you bring that up unprompted?    
What? You prompted it.    
Jake, there's a body over here.    
Oh, thank God.    
I mean, ""Oh, no, death.""    
I mean... I don't want to sleep with my mom, okay?    
I know this is the wrong takeaway from this case board, but I really love the new yarn you're using.    
- There are sparkles in it.
- I noticed.    
Okay, so let's go over what we got.    
No witnesses, no weapon.
Bruising indicates a struggle.    
No conclusive DNA found at the scene other than from the three of us who found the body.    
And our chief suspect, James Buckley, has disappeared.    
But he has no motive, no criminal record, and according to his credit card statement, had just purchased two sombreros.    
Kind of weird to give someone a sombrero when you're about to murder them.    
Well, both sombreros could have been for him.    
It's always good to have a backup sombrero. 
Please stop pronouncing it like that.    
What, pronouncing sombreros 
- like sombrero?
- Yes.    
[Spanish accent] Fine, if you want me to pronounce it the wrong way.    
Look, I think James is a good suspect.    
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks, and they specifically mention that he's been having violent fantasies for the last few months.    
And you want us to just blindly trust Dr. Tate?    
He's a creepy therapist. They all are.    
What kind of profession requires a couch?    
Lots of them. My cousin Pam has a couch in his bird store.
Would you call that creepy?    
Yes! Decidedly so.

Well, he probably just guessed, because it's obvious.    
This is New York.    
It's never obvious where the bathroom is.    
I once had an apartment where the toilet was literally in the refrigerator.    
I bet he was sleeping with Susan.    
Therapists are always having affairs with their patients.    
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?    
Tell that to the ten minutes of ""Bikini Shrink""    
I watched on Cinemax when I was   .    
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.    
James was ill. We have months of notes saying he was increasingly unstable.    
First of all, people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators.    
I heard that on NPR when I was in the room    
- while Amy was listening to NPR.
- Ah.    
And second, I bet Dr. Tate's notes are fake.    
I mean, you know what
was in Dr. Juggs's notes?    
- What?
- Stick figures doing it.    
- What does that prove?
- I don't know, but it was hot.    
All I'm saying is, something feels suspicious to me here.    
Maybe we should go to Dr. Tate's office and see if we can find the missing notebooks.    
Wait, you're basing this all on the fact that he knew where a bathroom was?    
And his DNA was at the scene where we discovered the body.    
[gasps] I bet that's why he insisted on coming with us to the park.    
You've been weird about Dr. Tate from the start.    
To me, the evidence suggests that James killed his wife and fled.    
It's my case, and that's the lead we're following.    
Okay.    
You're right. I'm sorry.    
I was being unfair. It's your case.    
You call in an APB, and I will meet you back at the precinct.    
I'm just gonna swing by the bank.    
You're not gonna go to Dr. Tate's office and search it behind my back, are you?    
What? Charles, no.    
I wouldn't do that. You can trust me.    
- Okay, I trust you.
- Good. You should.    
- Well, I do.
- Great, because you can.    
- I feel good about it.
- Good, you should.    
I think it's the right choice.    
You're making the right call by trusting me.    
Not.    
""Wayne's World."" Sweet.    
[lock clicks]    
All right, think.    
Where would I hide the real notebook if I was a creepy therapist?    
In my butt. [chuckles]    
Focus, Jake.    
Now is not the time for being hilarious.    
[faint rustling]    
What have we here?    
James and Susan Buckley.    
[voices in hallway]    
So your day's been going well?    
- It has, it has.
- They're blocking my way out.    
A cancellation, and so I was able to get more work done.    
Yeah. Well, that's always nice.    
Same thing happened to me yesterday.    
- Is that right?
- Yeah, two cancellations.    
You know? At least it wasn't three.    
- [laughs]
- Have a good afternoon.    
- You too.
- Okay.    
See you in the morning.    
Oh, um, can I help you?    
Yes.    
I am... your new patient.    
- Garrett?
- Garrett... is my name, yes.    
You're an hour and a half early.    
I know. I have problems with time management.    
That's the issue I want to talk about.    
On the phone, you said you were concerned you might have multiple personality disorder.    
Yep, that too.    
Got buttloads of peeps living in my brain, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.    
We should talk about it.    
I can't believe it's taken so long for us to meet.    
You're so nice.    
Oh, I don't know about that, Jocelyn.    
I'm just being myself.    
Well, you're very sweet about the cosmetology thing.    
A lot of people are dismissive of hairstylists.    
It makes no sense.    
If we didn't have hairstylists to cut our hair, our hair would be far too long.    
- [laughs]
- Wow, great compliment.    
Hey, you're the girl from the diarrhea commercial, aren't you?    
You get diarrhea on the plane.    
- That's not true.
- Yeah, move along.    
I don't get diarrhea on the plane.    
I get diarrhea in the airport.    
What's going on?    
Are you... an actor?    
Well, you don't have to sound so grossed out.    
I can see why you didn't want him meeting Jocelyn.    
- Excuse me?
- This isn't Jocelyn.    
It's Sheena. She's an actress.    
Yeah, I was in an episode of ""SVU.""    
I say, ""We want answers.""    
The director tried to replace me, but Mariska said it would take too much time, and then they all agreed I'd probably cut together fine.    
Look, Diaz, I've obviously misread our relationship.    
You didn't want me to meet the real Jocelyn because we're not as close as I thought we were, so... message received.    
Hey, so you don't by any chance need any molly, do you?    
- I'm a cop.
- And scene.    
Now I'm out of character, and I don't sell any drugs.    
I am leaving.    
So, Garrett, where would you like to begin?    
You know what, can we crack the door a little?    
I get very claustrophobic, probably from all the different people living in my head.    
We usually keep it closed for privacy, but whatever makes you comfortable.    
Thank you.    
Damn it, he's still here.    
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?    
Uh, I was just talking to another one of the voices.    
- Is it Tatiana?
- Who now?    
The mischievous seven-year-old British girl you told me about on the phone?    
May I speak with her?    
Uh...    



[high-pitched British accent] Yes?    
Hello, Doctor.    
I'm from Wussex.    
Is that an actual place in England?    
How should I know?    
I'm just a little girl, I am, I am.    
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Tatiana.    
Can I say hello to Brian, the bookkeeper from Central London?    
[in accent] Cheers, I'm Brian.    
I like bookkeeping right in the middle of London.    
Did I tell you a full list of my many personalities when I called you on the ol' telly, innit?    
Yes, you did.    
And are any of 'em, hopefully, not from England?    
There's Geoffrey.    
You said he's Australian.    
Aww, crikey.    
Hey, Sarge. I saw the flyers.    
You really put a lot of them up, huh?    
I just want to make extra sure we find the real book-buyer.    
Do you think it's this kind of overcompensation that's been making things difficult in the bedroom?    
Oh, I don't compensate.    
I procreate. Three kids.    
Okay. Weird brag.    
Look, just take the book. Nobody cares.    
Hey, I just saw this.
I think you have my book.    
Oh, really?    
Told ya!    
But you're not even married, Scully.    
I'm in a committed relationship, and Cindy Shatz says I'm a selfish lover.    
All right, well, what about the protein powder?    
I'm trying to get ripped.    
I drink, like, six shakes a day, but nothing's happening.    
- Do you also exercise?
- What?    
You're supposed to exercise?    
You know what, keep the powder.    
I'll drink normal milkshakes.    
And you thought that was my book.    
[laughs] Shame on you, Amy.    
Shame on you.    
You got the book?    
You should know, things are good with Sharon.    
I just want to make sure we're as happy in our relationship    
- as we can be.
- That's nice, Sarge.    
Sorry you had to embarrass yourself.    
Not a big deal.    
I guess I just don't care what other people think of me.    
That's actually pretty inspiring.    
I wish I was more like that.    
Yeah. Now, if you'll excuse me...    
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!    
You're not gonna wait for me to leave?    
Like I said, I just don't care.    
Well, Garrett, our time is up.    
Shall we pick up here next week?    
No, I can't go.    
There's still someone left inside that wants to talk.    
Do you mean Satchel, the ""gentle African-American man who was born in     ""?    
Oh, no, you know what?    
Satchel probably shouldn't come out right now.    
Or ever, for that matter.    
Garrett, I can only help you if you open up.    
[sighs]    
[deep voice] And then Dufresne escaped through the tunnels of Shawshank Prison.    
He was my friend.    
Are you just doing Morgan Freeman?    
Ah, yes!    
You calling me on it just gave me a major breakthrough.    
I'm cured! Anyway, deuces, Doc!    
♪ ♪ 
I've got you now, you son of a bitch.    
- Hello, Peralta.
- [screams]    
You really thought you could sneak around my office without me noticing, huh?    
How'd you know I was in there?    
Your shampoo left an odor.    
I could smell you.    
I knew it! You're a Hannibal.    
Pull over right here. Cut the engine.    
Why are you doing this?    
Because you found my notebooks, and I assume you've deduced what I did to Susan and James.    
- You killed James too?
- Oops.    
I guess you only deduced the Susan part.    
But it doesn't matter.    
You never would have thought that James was a suspect.    
He was such a kind and gentle man.    
So why did you kill them?    
Well, because they were gonna tell people about my affair with Susan and ruin my career.    
- I knew it.
- I had to do it for the sake of my other patients.    
You know, there are a lot of people who depend on me for their well-being.    
Yeah, except for the ones that you murder.    
- That's only happened twice.
- It's happened before?    
The Rothmans. Nobody misses them.    
You really are a terrible therapist.    
Oh, wow, strong words for someone who is clearly scared to talk about his own issues.    
I'm not scared, okay?    
For example, I had an issue with texting while driving, but I fixed it.    
Now I just don't look at my phone while I type.    
Case in point.    
Just know that you died without saying anything real.    
Okay, okay, okay! Stop.    
Fine, you want something real?    
I tried therapy.
It only made things worse.    
Uh-huh. Go on.    
When I was a kid, I was acting out at school, so they made me and my parents do family counseling, but instead of helping me with my problems, the stupid therapist just brought up all my parents' issues.    
And once it was all out in the open, they fought all the time and eventually got divorced, and everything good in my life just... went away.    
Interesting. So you actually blame yourself for your parents' divorce?    
No, I blame the therapy, which we only had to do because I...    
oh, my God.    
I do blame myself.    
[choking up]
Oh, here come the waterworks.    
[machine whirring]    
Excuse me, do you have a less crinkly dollar    
- I could trade you for?
- Of course I do.    
None of my dollars has a single crinkle.    
When they do, I steam them.    
Oh. Wow, that is crisp.    
Can't wait to get this baby home and flatten it out.    
[keypad beeping]    
- Almonds, nice choice.
- Oh, thanks.    
They're, uh... they're not for me.    
They're for my girlfriend, Detective Diaz.    
Oh, you must be Jocelyn.    
What? No, I'm Denise.    
Who's Jocelyn? Is Rosa cheating on me?    
Oh, my...    
No, that was a joke.    
I'm sorry, I thought it would be funny.    
I am Jocelyn.    
Oh, that was actually very funny.    
I didn't know what was happening, and then I thought I knew what was happening, but what I thought I knew was happening wasn't what was happening.    
That's very good.    
- You must be Captain Holt.
- Mm-hmm.    
- Hey.
- Hey.    
Uh, can you give us a second, babe?    
Yeah, I'll wait out there.    
Pleasure to meet you, Captain.    
So this is Jocelyn?    
I'm glad you got to meet her.
For the record, I wasn't keeping her from you because I was afraid you were gonna hurt her feelings by being judgy.    
I think it's hilarious when you're judgy.    
It's because I was afraid you weren't gonna like her.    
You and I are close, and I...    
I value your opinion.    
Well, she seems great, in our limited interaction.    
Maybe you could get to know her better over Kevin's rice this weekend?    
That would be great.    
You might want to save your girlfriend.    
She's talking to Hitchcock.    
Damn it, Hitchcock!    
So I joke about my father so much to avoid processing all the pain he's caused me.    
Yes. You are doing such great work here.    
- I'm really feeling it.
- Yeah.    
Now, I'm sorry, but our session is coming to a close.    
I guess I'll have to bill your widow.    
Wow, that is cold-blooded, but I got to hand it to you, it's a pretty dope kill line.    
Unfortunately, no one will be billed, though.    
Isn't that right, Charles?    
- Hi, Dr. Tate!
- What? How did he...    
Told you I could text without looking at my phone.    
Let's go.    
Oh, man, I am so glad you got my message with the location.    
Pretty impressive, right?    
Well, actually, you just texted a bunch of crazy, weird, random letters.    
It made me concerned, so I tracked your phone.    
Well, still pretty good. I found you in my contacts.    
It went to Amy. She forwarded it to me.    
It worked. Let's stop talking about it.    
Listen, I'm sorry.    
I guess you were right about the therapist.    
Yeah, well, that's nice of you to say, Charles, but actually, when I was stalling Dr. Tate,    
I started talking about my parents' divorce, and it felt really good.    
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but...    
I think I'm gonna make an appointment with a shrink.    
Jake, that is so great.    
And I know a guy who's really good.    
You will love having him inside of you.    
Okay.    
What? Oh, come on, mister. Grow up.    
Get your mind out of the gutter, ya perv!

Hey, what's up?
I came as fast as I could.  
Title of your s*x tape. Nailed it.  
So have you ever heard of a guy named Bruno Rojas?  
Yeah, big guy in the Colombian cartel, right?  
He was, until he got shot in the chest yesterday by his top lieutenant.  
Apparently, the bullet went straight through his nipple.  
Whoa. Nature's bull's-eye.  
Oh, my God, I love the way your brain works.   
Anyway, he's in a coma now, and Captain Holt thinks if I'm here when he wakes up, I can get him to talk.   
- So what'd you call me for?
- Because I need a partner.   
- What about them?
- Oh, we're not here for work.   
I brought Scully in because he needs some medical tests.   
Yeah, I'm here all the time.   
I'm kind of the mayor of this place.   
Cheryl, baby, you got a fresh bag for me?   
Saving you the biggest one, Scully.   
You're too good to me.   
Anyway, I'll see you guys around.   
Dan, Dan, the enema man. [laughs]   
Well, guess it's kind of nice to see Scully in his element.   
Whoo!   
Jake, I can't stay here with you.   
I have so much on my plate at work.   
Yeah, so do I.   
I mean, I've been pulling double shifts nonstop, but we haven't really gotten to hang out in almost a month.   
Our anniversary is coming up, and we don't even have anything planned.   
I know, but we talked about this.   
We're gonna take a trip as soon as we have time.   
- I promise.
- Just like you promised we would see the ""Bumblebee"" movie?   
I didn't promise that. I believe what I said was, ""Isn't that a kids' movie?""   
Yeah, and I believe what I said was, ""It's for teens."" [snorting laughter]   
Look, I get that you can't take any time off from work, but this is a loophole. It's still work.   
You know, we can hang out here and chat and catch up and laugh, and technically, we'll be doing our jobs.

Yes. Just tell him I need supervision.

- Oh.
- Yeah. Shall we, ma chérie?   
I asked the lady at the store what her favorite cheeses were, and those were all super expensive, so I got us a budget-conscious selection of local cheddars.   
So, a full year of marriage. What was your favorite part?   
[gasps] Are you asking me to do a marriage highlight reel countdown à la ""NBA Inside Stuff""?   
I mean, that's not exactly what I was...   
Number five!   
Ahmad Rashad. It's my best impression.   
Number five was the time that we accidentally got our contact lenses switched.   
I got to see the world through your eyes.   
But our prescriptions are different,   
- and the world was so blurry.
- Yeah, it was crazy.   
I thought I was having a stroke.    
- Okay, your turn.
- Number four!    
Oh, is an old witch introducing this highlight?    
That was exactly what you sounded like.    
- No.
- Yes.    
- Agree to disagree.
- Fine.    
Number four was when we played laser tag and we shot all those little kids.    
Oh, yeah. We really messed up little Mason's birthday party.

- Deservedly so.    
- He was a jerk.

- We shared a car with Alfred.

Okay, number two.

Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about.

Oh, Pam can stay but not me?

I am. I have a twisted bowel.    
I have a tube; I have a bag.
Do you want to see?    
Oh, no, no, no. But thank you, Pam.    
Let me know if you smell anything.    
I don't even notice it anymore.    
Well, I'm pretty sure I actually already smell something.    
- No, you'll know.
- Oh.    
Do you two have kids?    
Mixed race babies are always so adorable.    
Oh, you said words.    
Yeah, we don't have kids yet, but we're gonna start trying soon.    
I just have the one, my Bobby.    
He was such a cute little kid, until he discovered his wiener.    
Pam, there you are. It's time for your IV.    
You're playing music in here? You can't do that.    
Why not, Nurse Janet?    
Is it gonna distract the doctors?    
Yes, that's exactly what it'll do.    
Okay, fine, I'll turn it off immediately.    
[music stops]    
- Are we the bad guys here?
- Yeah, it seems very likely.    
Hey, by the way, we don't have to pretend we're undercover here.    
The hospital staff knows we're cops.    
Oh, I wasn't setting up cover.    
- Was I?
- Well, just the kids thing.    
Saying that we were gonna start trying soon.    
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean right away.    
I just meant in the near future.    
Oh. [chuckles] Okay.    
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.    
Cool, cool, cool, cool, except for that there's one little problem there, which is that I don't know that I totally know that I for sure want to have kids, so...    
- You don't?
- No.    
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.    
Oh.    
I don't understand. I thought we were on the same page about kids.    
- We talked about this.
- We did?    
Aw, look at these pictures my brother sent of Matthew.    
- Mm.
- We should do this someday.    
What do you think?    
Are you kidding me? Of course.    
I was talking about going to the water park.    
You were talking about having kids?    
Yeah! I said, ""Do you think we can afford it?""    
And you said, ""We'll start saving right away.""    
So let me get this straight.    
All that water park money I've been saving, you want to spend it on kids now?    
Yeah. Why would you want to spend that much money on a water park?    
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know what to say here.    
I just... I never wanted children.    
Well, I always have.    
All right, so how do we handle this?    
I mean, there's only one thing to do when two people have diametrically opposing views on a subject.    
Talk about it lovingly and decide how to move forward?    
- Structured debate.
- Oh. Fun.    
High school format. Modified Lincoln-Douglas.    
Let's take one hour apart for research and prep. Yeah.    
Great, I'll just do a Lincoln-Douglas.    
I'd be careful if I were you. Relationships are like bowels.    
Once you get them twisted, they can never untwist.

♪    
That's all you prepped?    
Yeah, I just searched my heart and then wrote down how I was feeling.    
I'm gonna eat you alive, you dumb son of a bitch.    
Cool. And then we'll have kids together?    
Yeah. It's gonna be great.    
Okay, the topic today is whether or not we should have children.    
I will be taking the affirmative.    
You will be taking the negative.    
Each round will be individually scored by our judge, Captain Holt.    
Do you need to hear my credentials?    
Debate moderator license D as in delta,  - - ...    
- I believe you.
- Y as in Yankee,  - .    
J as in Juliet, J as in Juliet,  .    
- Great.
- I have a variety of timers.    
- Do you prefer a buzz or a ding?
- Don't care.    
- Ding.
- Okay.    
Peralta, you can present the first argument from your, uh...    
[scoffs] Scribbled list of feelings.    
I'll have you know that I have some data-driven arguments as well.    
According to a study I read, people with kids were less likely to report that they were happy in their lives than people without kids.    
Now, call me crazy, but being happy tends to make me feel, uh, pretty happy.    
Where did you read this study?    
Well, it wasn't something I read so much as told about.    
And who told you about it?    
- Hitchcock.
- Hitchcock?    
- Yeah.
- That seems like a pretty intellectual thing for him to mention.    
What was the context?    
He had invested in a NuvaRing competitor called Vag-a-Plug and was practicing his sales pitch on me.    
This is your first argument? Your opening statement?    
- [bell dings]
- Point to Amy.    
All right, fine. Forget the study.    
I just don't want to lose what we already have.    
Ask anyone with children and they'll tell you children bring meaning and love into your life.    
Yes, there may be some moments that you lose, but there will also be new moments.    
Take the water park.    
I would never go with you, but you know who would?    
- Your kid.
- Point to Amy.    
That's not your call to make, Peralta.    
[bell dings] Point to Amy.    
Okay, fine. New subject: work.    
We both work way too much.    
Why bother having kids if you never get to spend time with them?    
I mean, I love my job, and I know you love yours, and I don't think it's fair for either of us to have to sacrifice that.    
Do you know why I want to become lieutenant so badly?    
To prove your worth to your hyper judgmental parents.    
Yes, obviously that.    
But also, the higher your rank, the more control over your hours.    
Plenty of people have jobs and kids, Jake, and they find a way.    
This has become more about your employment status.    
As your supervisor, I feel I have a conflict of interest and should abstain from judging.    
Okay, so do we both get a point?    
No. Kevin has been on the phone all this time.    
He's also a licensed debate moderator.    
License number J as in Juliet,  - - ... 
- This means nothing to me.
- H as in hotel. 
- Z as in Zulu.
- Oh, thank God he stopped.    
 - - . 
- Point to Amy.
- Okay, fine.    
You want to know why I really don't want to have children?    
I had a crappy dad.    
I know what happens when you mess up as a parent.    
It's not great.    
And this may come as a shock to you, but...    
I kind of have some dad issues with certain people.    
- Holt.
- Me.    
- Raymond.
- Yeah, but not just him.    
It's every male authority figure from my entire life.    
Hey, Jake, can you move ""Legends of the Fall""    
from new releases into drama?    
You got it, Dad.    
Craig was only six weeks older than me.    
Since this has become about me, I'm gonna have to abstain from this round as well, but Kevin is still standing by.    
Actually, I feel as though your personal relationship 
with Peralta affects me too. 
Luckily, I had Gail standing by as well. 
[gasps] Oh, my God, you guys know Gail?    
Who's Gail?    
Vice president of the Debaters Club. 
This is a very big deal.    
Do you need to hear my credentials? 
License number U as in uniform,  ... 
No! No more credentials, please.    
I don't want to have a structured debate.    
It's an idiotic way to decide something.    
- What?
- How dare you?    
Is he insane? 
Raymond, Kevin, I'll be reporting this. 
Okay, look.    
Amy, I'm scared, okay?    
I'm scared that we're gonna have a child and I won't be able to handle it, I'm scared that I'm not gonna be a good father, and I'm scared that I'll make a mistake I can't take back.    
Jake, I get it. I'm scared too.    
Every other big decision I've made in my life I was sure about: becoming a cop, asking you to marry me, buying those Jordan  s for $   .    
Wait, you spent $    on sneakers?    
Yeah, they were so cool, and if I had never worn them, they would have kept their value.    
- So they lost their value?
- Yes, all of it.    
I stepped in a puddle as soon as I left the store.    
But this isn't about the Jordans.    
This is about the fact that I don't want to bring a human being into this world unless I'm    % sure that I'm ready to take care of it.    
Okay?    
Too emotional. Point to Amy. 
Okay, Gail is clearly biased.    
I think we need a new moderator.    
Bob Templeman here. 
What? How many people are on this phone call?    
Hey, so Holt went to go smooth things over with Gail.    
He thinks we may just have to pay the Debaters Guild a small fine.    
Cool. And as you can see, Pam is here.    
She has some thoughts.    
I was saying to Jake, before Bobby, I didn't think I wanted to have kids either.    
But he's the best thing that ever happened to me.    
Hey, Pam, could you give us a minute?    
Oh, of course.
I'm gonna call my friend JoAnn.    
She's been waiting for a big update on all of this.    
Great.    
[sighs]    
I'm sorry. The debate was a bad idea.    
I just...    
I felt ambushed by the fact that you didn't want kids, and I thought I could fix it with logic.    
I mean, what if I had won the debate?    
Jake, I'm trying so hard to be nice, but I don't know how to respond to that.    
- Cold-blooded but fair.
- I get it.    
You're scared. I can't change that.    
Yeah, but that doesn't mean    
I'll never change how I feel about it.    
I mean, I used to be scared of sushi, and now it's my favorite food.    
I got tuna sashimi from a pharmacy the other day.    
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, it was very warm.    
I got so sick.    
Look, can we just press pause on this conversation?    
I mean, let's enjoy our lives for a little bit, and then maybe the next time it comes up, I'll feel differently, okay?    
- No.
- What?    
I need an answer from you now.    
[chuckles] Like right this minute?    
You can take a day or a week, or maybe a month.    
That's not a lot of time, Ames.    
I mean, that doesn't seem totally fair.    
Well, now you know how I feel.    
Women don't have the luxury of waiting till we're and then changing our minds and getting remarried and having a baby with some dumb   -year-old.    
Oh, come on.    
There's no way I'm gonna be rich enough that a   -year-old is gonna want to be with me.    
Did that help?    
Look, I don't understand what the big deal is.    
You're still young. We have plenty of time.    
I know, but I don't want to wait around for two years and then have you decide you don't want kids,    
'cause I don't want to start over at   .    
Start over?

♪ The vibe in here is really weird ♪    
I think they're having a fight.    
No, it's not a fight, it's just a devastatingly sad conversation about whether or not we should have kids or just start over, so you were totally wrong, Rosa.    
What? You got married without talking about if you want children?    
Yeah, and we also got married without discussing whether or not we like water parks.    
A lot of new stuff has come up, okay, Terry?    
- Why are you guys here?
- A CI came in.    
There's a lot of chatter that whoever tried to kill Rojas is coming to finish the job.    
- At the hospital?
- Yeah.    
Holt wanted extra manpower here.    
Okay, why don't you two lock down the nurses' station while Amy and I secure the room?    
Actually, I'd rather be with Rosa.    
- Uh-oh.
- Damn, Jake.    
[sighs] Thanks a lot, Sarge.    
You told me to sing!    
Yeah, but what was all this?    
That's just Terry being Terry.    
Okay, from this vantage we can see the elevator and the stairs.    
No one should be able to get to Rojas without us noticing.    



- Cool.
- Hey, look, um...    
I don't want you to get caught in the middle of this stuff between me and Jake.    
I don't want you to choose sides.    
- Already chose. I'm with you.
- Really?    
I didn't know you wanted kids.    
I don't know if I'll ever want kids, but you should have them.
They're so cute.    
- It's [bleep] up.
- Aw, it is [bleep] up.    
Anyway, do you want me to talk to Jake?    
- I'm a pretty good bully.
- Thanks, but no.    
I've got this covered. I left him alone with Terry.    
That guy is a walking advertisement for the joys of fatherhood.    
- Do not do it.
- What?    
- Don't you love your girls?
- So much.    
You should have seen Cagney this morning    
- with her little braids in.
- Oh.    
But they are a ton of work, man.    
If you are not totally,   % sure you want them, you won't survive.    
- Is it really that hard?
- Yes.    
I never get any sleep. I'm always sick.    
I never get to watch anything I want on TV.    
I still haven't finished ""Breaking Bad,"" but I can recite ""Moana"" from memory?    
""Maui, shape-shifter, demigod of the wind and sea.    
I am Moana."" Why do I know that?    
I don't want to watch kids' movies.    
I want to watch movies for adults.    
Adults and teens.    
And they are getting so manipulative.    
Yesterday, Cagney pretended to be hurt, I went in to help her, and Lacey snuck in the kitchen and stole two cookies.    
Oh, my God. Your children are monsters.    
Hey, those are my kids, man.    
- Back off.
- Right.    
And the crazy part is,    
I really do want to go to the water park, but I can't give that to him because it's the only card I hold.    
- Mm.
- [bell dings]    
Elevator.    
Excuse me, NYPD. Can I see your ID?    
Amy, behind the wheelchair.    
NYPD! Stop!    
[grunts]    
- Diaz for Jeffords.
- This is Terry.    
I think we got our guy. Colombian man, unarmed, but he tried to run as soon as we identified ourselves.    
And he's got a picture of Rojas on his phone.    
We'll be right there.    
No one in or out of this hallway.    
Why do you think that guy is unarmed?    
Who knows? Maybe he was trying to smother Rojas or unplug his life support.    
Or maybe he's a distraction, and someone else is going for the cookie jar.    
What?    
♪    
Hi, Pam.    
Hi, Jake.    
Don't come any closer, or I'll blow us both up!    
I'm sorry.    
You weren't supposed to be here.    
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It's okay, Pam.    
No need to panic. We're just talking.    
Look, I'm just gonna put this away.    
No, Terry, don't open that, please.    
What's going on in there?    
There is a woman in here with an explosive device.    
- What? You okay?
- Yep. Everyone is fine.    
I just need you to evacuate this entire floor, call ESU and the bomb squad right away, and jam all cellular and Wi-Fi signals.    
On it.    
Okay, Pam, so we're just gonna stay calm here and talk this thing through as friends.    
This isn't supposed to be happening.    
The man said that I'd be able to sneak in here unnoticed.    
What man? Who asked you to do this?    
I didn't get his name, but he was very attractive.    
Antonio Banderas could play him in a movie.    
What has he been doing lately?    
You know what? He should be on ""Outlander.""    
Okay, Pam, I'm gonna cut you off, but it's not because I'm not interested.    
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.    
I get chatty when I get nervous.    
This man who gave you the bomb, did he happen to mention whether or not it's on a timer    
or if there's a remote detonator?    
I don't know. I'm terrible with electronics.    
I wish my son Bobby were here.
He taught me how to iPad.    
Okay, I also know how to iPad, so maybe I could take a look.    
Stay where you are!    
The man told me that when I got the bomb set,    
I should text him with this phone and if anything went wrong, I should push this button.    
No, no, no, no!
You don't want to do that.    
Yes, I do. I have to.    
Well, there's only one thing to do when two people have diametrically opposing opinions on a subject.    
- Structured debate.
- What?    
Yeah, I just learned about it.    
All right, I will argue the negative: I don't want to blow up.    
And you can argue the affirmative: you do want to blow up, which I have to say, Pam, is a very tough stance to take.    
I don't want to blow up, but the man said he'd give me $   ,   .    
This is so Bobby can take care of my granddaughter.    
That girl means the world to me.    
Fine, fine. Point to Pam.    
But if you care about her so much, how can you just blow yourself up?    
You'll never get to see her again.    
Well, at least I know she'll be financially well taken care of.    
Sure, but is this really how you want her to remember you?    
- As a murderer?
- I'd rather be remembered as a woman who blew up a mobster to help her family rather than a librarian whose bowels are tied up like a sailor's knot!    
Okay, that's a very strong argument.    
Very strong.    
But you're forgetting one thing.    
You're not just gonna be killing a mobster.    
You're also gonna be killing me.    
He said the blast would only hurt people in the room.    
You could just walk right out of here.    
Pam, you know I can't do that.    
Now, please, just give me the bomb.    
And then what?    
Bobby doesn't get any money and I go to jail?    
I can't go to jail.    
Every roommate I've ever had has hated me.    
In college, I had a roommate named Mary-Ellen, and she was dating the brother of Steve Guttenberg...    
Pam, what are we talking about here?    
I'm sorry. I'm really nervous.    
Wait, wait, wait, wait! I know it probably feels like you don't have a lot of options right now.    
In fact, this whole situation probably feels like... like a twisted bowel, but it's not.    
There's still one end of this bowel that's open.    
Which end?    
- The butt end.
- I'm listening.    
Okay, if you hand me that bomb right now, nothing bad will have happened, and that'll be because of you, because you cooperated.    
Also, I'm sure a judge would understand how you got into this situation.    
I mean, you were asked to do this    
by an Antonio Banderas type.
Who could say no to that?    
And even if you do go to prison, it is gonna be such a fancy prison.    
- With a lot of crafts?
- Yes, with tons of crafts.    
Pam, listen to me.    
Let's untwist this bowel together.    
Let's clear everything out.    
[exhales]    
Okay.    
[sighs in relief]    
You did great, Pam. Thank you.    
Now that it's out of my hands, I can see it really is a bomb.    
Yes. Yes, it is.    
- Oh, my God, get some help!
- Okay.    
♪    
- You okay?
- Hey.    
Yeah, I'm okay.    
Really surprised by Pam.    
- I did not see that coming.
- Right?    
You should have seen the look on my face when I saw it was her.    
Your jaw just dropped.    
- Oh, she's right there.
- Mm-hmm.    
Good-bye, Pam.
Good luck with everything.    
- Kind of liked her in the end.
- Yeah.    
So did they defuse the bomb?    
Yeah, one of 'em.    
Oh, you didn't hear?
There was a second bomb.    
Ya butt.    
- Ya butt is da bomb.
- Aww.    
On our anniversary.    
Speaking of which, I requested next week off so we can take an actual vacation... to the water park.    
I've never been more in love with you in my entire life.    
And hey, I've been thinking, and I do want to have kids.    
With you.    
- You're not scared anymore?
- Oh, no, I am so scared.    
Maybe even more so than before, but I was scared in there with Pam too, and you know, I didn't panic or mess anything up there.    
If anything, I was sharper. I was a freakin' debate genius.    
Debate genius? Oh, that's very hot.    
Oh, that's an added bonus. Okay, keep that energy up.    
But the point that I was actually trying to make is, maybe it's a good thing that I'm scared of fatherhood.    
You know? Maybe it'll turn me into a freakin' dad genius.    
But we don't have to start trying right away, right?    
I mean, I don't know that I'm all the way there yet.    
No, of course not.    
- Whenever we're both ready.
- How do you know when that is?    
I guess we'll just have to have another one of these really fun, casual conversations.    
Cool. Love that. Can't wait.    
[laughs]    
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, please.    
Maybe we can grab some Thai food and brainstorm baby names?    
Ooh, I like that.    
Now, I am a fan of the show ""American Gladiators.""    
How do you feel about the name Blaze Peralta?    
Not great.    
- What about Laser?
- No.    
- Nitro?
- No.    
- Viper?
- No.    
- Atlas?
- Ooh, I do love atlases.

Are you trying to outdo me?    
No, no, no.    
Just trying to raise morale.    
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.    
Morale, morale, morale. Okay.    
Wow, so this is your classroom.    
What's today's lecture about?    
I know you don't care about that.    
Just ask me what you want to ask me.    
Can I play with your laser pointer?    
You know, the laser pointer is a bit of a misnomer.    
It is simply a laser.
The pointer is you.    
- That was awesome.
- Take it for a spin.    
Don't mind if I do. Good afternoon, class.    
Allow me to make my first... point.    
- Very impressive.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.    
But I do have five additional points to make.    
Chair, chair, wall, chair, Captain Holt. Captain Holt? No.    
[laughs] Yes, that was a delicious lunch, Gary!    
And I agree, our group does seem happier than it was before.    
Oh, the pizza was that good?    
Pizza? Right, that's what I said we were getting before we decided to uh-snazz it up.    
Oh, you guys snazzed?    
Yeah, we snazzed all the way to La Petite Creperie.    
I thought we couldn't say ""snazz.""    
Oh, no, I was thinking of [bleep].    
We can't say [bleep]. Carry on.    
Tell 'em how good it was, Rosa.    
Tell 'em how high our morale is.    
- High.
- Oh, stop gushing, girl.    
I think it's so interesting you guys didn't stick to your original plan, because neither did we.    
What? Why?    
Oh, you don't think we knew you were gonna snazz?    
[scoffs] We saw your snazz coming a mile away.    
That's why I took my team out for some big, juicy steaks, and...    
ALL: ♪ Mashed potatoes ♪    
♪ And some spinach and some key lime pie ♪    
- Thank you, Heather.
- Mm-hmm.    
Well, that doesn't sound better than crepes.    
It is. Terry wins.    
We know. We were at both lunches.    
How? They were simultaneous and two miles apart.    
It was free food. Life finds a way.    
Okay, but you can't win    
because it wasn't a competition.    
So let's make it a competition.    
Same groups tomorrow?    
Okay, but let's agree at the end of this    
- that we'll still be friends.
- No deal.    
Good! 'Cause I didn't mean it anyway.    
Hello, sir. How'd you find us out?    
Mahler's Fourth Symphony.    
He'd never sit in just any section.    
I might. I'm flexible.    
Oh, really? You'd sit center left?    
In timpani alley?    
I'll purchase those tickets right away.    
No, don't! Fine.    
Jake is helping me with a burglary here at the university, and I asked him not to tell you.    
- Is this about St. Augustine?
- Yes.    
- What's going on?
- He's embarrassed of me.    
Last Christmas, the classics department threw a holiday party.    
I had one drink too many and utterly humiliated myself.    
And that was the point St. Augustine was making in ""Consolation of Philosophy.""    
Yeah, sounds super humiliating, saying something smart.    
Smart? I confused St. Augustine with Boethius.    
I might as well have stepped on a rake and bonked myself on the forehead.    
The problem wasn't what you said.    
It was that Dean Allister pointed out your mistake, and you lost your damned mind.    
I misremembered it because I'm reading both simultaneously.    
One book is too few for me.    
Where is everyone going?    
[clattering]    
It was quite the kerfuffle.    
The problem is, is that I get flustered and defensive because I know how they all see me: as Kevin's working-class bimbo.    
I can't imagine that's what they think.    
- It is.
- Really?    
Obviously I know that they're wrong, but they put you in your own head, and you're not yourself around them.    
I'm sorry, I was just trying to protect you.    
Yes, of course, thank you for saving me from myself.    
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go sit by the pool and read some fiction...    
like the bimbo that I am.    
There's a pool here?    
Sir, wait.    
Oh! Wasn't expecting to catch up to you so fast.    
I don't know what to say now. I thought I was gonna have more running time to formulate it. Oh, I know!    
I'm sorry that we kept the case a secret from you.    
Oh, I understand why you did.    
The truth is, ever since I met Kevin, I've felt insecure in his world.    
I can't compete with these highly educated academics.    
I worry every day that I'll make one St. Augustine slip too many, and he'll realize...    
- I'm beneath him.
- This is insane.    
You're the smartest person I know.    
I'll explain it to you. Among Kevin's peers,    
- I'm a Jake.
- No, no, no, no, no.    
I refuse to live in a world where you're the Jake, because if you're the Jake, what does that make me?    
- The Charles?
- The Hitchcock.    
The Hitchcock? Oh, my God.    
You dropped down so many more levels than I was expecting.    
Okay, you know what? Screw this.    
You are so smart, and we're gonna prove it to those professors.    
You're gonna work this case, and you're gonna find those coins.    
Well, I suppose it would be nice to show them I'm more than just a hot, dumb piece of ass.    
Yes! That's the spirit.    
Now get that hot ass moving, 'cause we've got a crime to solve.    
Peralta, please, have some decorum.    
What? I was just using your words.    
Look, you teach people the way you want to be treated.    
That's what Dr. Phil says.    
Okay, lunchtime starts in ten minutes.    
Whichever team wins gets recorded on the Whiteboard of Victory.    
The winner will be decided by our judges,    
Hitchcock and Scully.    
Oh, my God, are we high status, Hitchcock?    
- I think so.
- What a world.    
Ah, well, good luck.    
I'm sure you know all the best places to eat since you've reached Elite status on Yelp.    
Oh, wait, that was me.    
Oh, because Yelp reviewers are sane people with great taste?    
Oh, sorry, couldn't hear you over GourmetGlen   saying  that my review of the duck skin at the Hearth and Feather was helpful.    
Come on, Team Jeffords. It's chow time.    
[Boyle chuckles]    
We have a cool thing to say too.    
Team Santiago, let's lunch-a-bunch!    
- No, I don't say that.
- Come on, Rosa, please?    
[mumbling] Let's lunch-a-bunch.    
Aha, Rosa said it!    
Did you hear that? Did you hear it?    
- Ah, Dean Allister?
- Policeman Raymond.    
Good to see you. [chuckles]    
Read any interesting magazines lately?    
This again? I was waiting for Kevin, I had finished my book, and I happened to glance at an issue of ""The Economist"" that someone left lying about.    
All I remember is you becoming unhinged.    
The only reason I picked it up was to swat a fly.    
I mean, I'm not crazy.    
Why are there always flowers here?    
So is policeman Raymond joining the case?    
Actually, he's leading it.    
Captain Holt is the finest investigator I've ever worked with.    
Sir, tell him our plan of action.    
- Clues.
- Okay, you're freezing up.    
I'm just gonna take the wheel for now.    
There were no signs of forced entry, the only people with access to the archives were the professors in the department, and they all have alibis, which means...    
I don't know what you want me to say.    
Okay, that's my fault for throwing it to you again.    
Which means we need to examine the crime scene.    
It is there that we will find what Captain Holt has so eloquently described as...    
Clues?    
[sighs] Sir, you just said it.    
Cupcakes up, everyone.    
Heather, you already ate yours?    
The point is to eat it in their faces.    
[horn honks]    
- Honk, honk, bitches.
- What the hell?    
We rented a party limo, drove to Coney Island for hot dogs, and then did karaoke the entire time.    
I sang ""It Wasn't Me"" by Shaggy. Crushed it.    
But that's not even about lunch!    
- It's...
- An experience.    
- Team Amy wins.
- What?    
How did you get there?
You were just with us.    
- Scully was with them.
- Free food.    
Great cupcake, Sarge.    
- But Amy still wins.
- Eat snazz, losers!    
[tires squealing]    
Okay, so there were no witnesses, no cameras, and no prints.    
In other words, we have nothing.    
That's what you get when you put a bimbo on the case.    
Okay, well, let's not give up all hope just yet.    
We do know some things.    
For example, the perp entered using a key, which means they probably work here.    
And they knew enough to skip past all these expensive-looking artifacts.    
They walked straight up to this shelf and grabbed the coin case from up there.    
It's too high. You can't reach it.    
Exactly. So now we know that the thief was taller than me. That's a good lead.    
Also, we know they were a little bit of a freak, since I am above average height according to the      census.    
I didn't realize you had a thing about your height.    
I don't! Because I'm above average.    
Why would I have a thing about my height when I'm above average? It doesn't make any sense.    
[snorting laugh]    
Anyways, we're looking for an insanely tall perp, a real Shaq type.    
Maybe the thief stood on something, like... one of these drawers.    
Turn off the light.    
Maybe something will show up under UV.    
- Bingpot!
- A footprint.    
You did it, you brilliant bimbo.    
Oh, there you are.
Why are you in the dark?    
Were you not able to find the light switch?    
Ha-ha, very funny, but I'll actually have you know    
Captain Holt just found a very promising lead.    
Oh, how fun, a lead.    
Meanwhile, we actually found the thief.    
- You did?
- What?    
Well, technically our janitor found him.    
Come on in, Randy.    
Tell them how you did their jobs.    
Well, um, I was emptying the trash in Professor Port's office.    
I saw something shiny sticking out from underneath a notepad.    
It was one of the missing coins.    
Great police work.    
Perhaps you might want to hire Randy, or...    
Randy, you could hire them.    
It seems like you all have basically the same skill set.    
[chuckles]    
We're actually all staffed up in maintenance.    
We don't want your job, Randy.    
I know Dean Allister humiliated us, but we can still have our revenge.    
I watched a ton of horny '  s comedies when I was a kid, and they're filled with ways of getting back at mean deans.    
So we are gonna throw the wildest party    
- this campus has ever seen.
- No.    
Okay, then we'll have a bikini car wash.    
No, no, save your schemes.    
I know exactly how to get back at the dean.    
- By arresting him.
- For what?    
It seems pretty obvious that Port did it.    
No, no, that makes no sense.    
Why would someone steal something valuable and then leave it in their desk?    
I feel like this is a veiled shot at me for leaving the crown in my desk during the third Halloween Heist.    
- It is.
- Oh.    
Allister planted the coin in Professor Port's desk.    
- They're rivals.
- Mm.    
Did you see the book Allister was holding back there?    
A biography of Macedonian general Parmenion.    
He was taunting us.    
Again, I'm the Hitchcock here.    
You're gonna have to connect the dots for me.    
Parmenion was a close advisor to Alexander the Great.    
Alexander suspected that Parmenion was trying to supplant him, so he executed him.    
He was getting rid of his rival.    
Sir, you cracked it!
You and your big hard brain.    
- Hard?
- Yes!    



You have the biggest, hardest brain on Earth, and I want you to say it.    
Say ""I am Raymond Holt, and my brain is rock hard.""    
A brain shouldn't be hard.    
If anything, I'll say, ""I am Raymond Holt, and my brain is soft and wet.""    
No, don't say that.
It's gross and I hate it.    
All right, let's go do some cop stuff.    
_    
Wait, why does Terry's team have four wins?    
He only won steaks, bowling, and the mobile escape room.    
You're forgetting about our breakfast at the Empire State Building.    
It was so cold up there.    
It sounds a lot better than our indoor skydiving lunch.    
Speaking of which, are we gonna get reimbursed for that?    
How dare you complain about the Funtastic FlyZone.    
That was funtastic fun for everyone.    
So what are you guys planning for today?    
Oh, nothing much.    
We're just gonna keep it ""caszh.""    
Us too. Super ""caszh.""    
Super duper ""caszh.""    
We all know you're both planning something insanely complicated and annoying.    
[laughs] Your teammates are turning against you, Terry.    
- I'm on your team.
- Who cares?    
We're gonna win. Team Lunch-a-Bunch forever.    
Sir, why are we still doing this?    
We've been following him for days,and he hasn't done anything suspicious.    
Let's just confront him.    
He only hid one of the stolen coins in Port's desk.    
He'll probably try to sell the others.    
I want to catch him in the act.    
- [door opens]
- Shh. Here he comes.    
♪ ♪ 
[chuckles] These college kids.    
I used to wear long-sleeve T-shirts under my short-sleeve T-shirts.    
Wait a minute, I still could.    
Hang on. He's stopping.    
Oh, no, he forgot his phone.    
He's gonna turn around and see us.
Come on.    
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, hey, guys, what's up?    
You want to join our a cappella jam circle?    
Oh, no.    
Are you guys Harry Potter fans?    
I do not like where this is going.    
Three, four.    
♪ Won't you come visit Hogwarts? ♪    
♪ I'll be alone, dancing in Gryffindor ♪    
♪ Harry is the best at the spells ♪    
♪ And as for potions, Hermione does well ♪    
This is actually pretty funny.    
You got to know Harry Potter.    
Wait a minute. Where'd Allister go?    
He was standing right here.    
It's like he vanished without a trace.    
Wrong, Peralta. He vanished with a trace.    
Check it out. His footprint. Gotcha.    
[whispers] I am Raymond Holt and my brain is rock hard.    
- I'm not going to say that.
- Smart.    
Saving it for a bigger moment in front of a bunch of people. Can't wait!    
Okay, squad, hope you ate lunch already, because it's lunchtime!    
- What's with the getups?
- Oh, nothing much.    
We just turned the parking garage into an elaborate paintball arena.    
It's zombie-themed. We hired    actors.    
That sounds pretty expensive.    
Nah, New York actors are desperate.    
For ten bucks, you can shoot 'em right in the face.    
Wow, that's amazing.    
I don't know how anybody could ever beat that... except maybe an in-office teppanyaki grill.    
Moshi moshi, losers!    
We got shrimp. We got lobster.    
Heather, I know you're allergic to shellfish.    
You're just gonna have to not eat.    
Where's Heather? Where is everybody?    
They're on the roof by Gina's statue.    
- What the hell, guys?
- Oh, God, they found us.    
- Don't let them take me.
- Why are you hiding from us?    
This lunch competition has gotten out of hand.    
No one is having fun.    
I keep having panic dreams about Sergeant Santiago shooting down my lunch ideas.    
Historic walking tours don't win lunch, Gary.    
No one cares about winning lunch.    
Please, just leave us alone.    
[sighs]    
Gary, wait. Look...    
- Oh!
- Ow!    
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God, it was an accident.    
This thing doesn't have a safety.    
Ow!    
Ow, stop! Help!    
And a big round of applause for Janitor Randy    
for recovering our precious coin.    
Don't applaud for that man.    
What's going on?    
What's going on is, Captain Holt just solved this case.    
What's there left to solve?
We found the coin    
in Professor Port's desk.
He's the thief.    
Oh, you'd like everyone to believe that, wouldn't you, Dean Allister?    
Or should I say, General Parmenion?    
Raymond, are you causing a kerfuffle?    
Yes. Sometimes a moment calls for a kerfuffle.    
No. No moment calls for a kerfuffle.    
You know my feelings on this.    
Dean Allister framed Professor Port to get rid of a rival, just as Alexander got rid of Parmenion.    
Preposterous. Do you even have a shred of evidence to back up that claim?    
Oh, we've got more than a shred.    
Look at these photos.    
Here, a footprint from the scene of the crime left by the thief.    
And here, another print made yesterday by you.    
- You've been caught, Allister!
- Is it happening?    
- Caught by me.
- It is happening.    
- Me and my rock hard brain.
- It happened!    
Oh, Raymond. Look around.    
These shoes I'm wearing with their ""unique footprint""...we all have them.    
They were the departmental gift this Christmas.    
They're actually very funny.    
They have Achilles printed on the heel.    
I don't know if I would call that ""very"" funny.    
I'm surprised you didn't know about them.    
Kevin must have gotten a pair.    
Oh, I remember what happened.    
You had to leave the Christmas party before they were handed out.    
Why was that again?
Oh, yes. The kerfuffle.    
But what about the autobiography of Persimminons you were taunting us with?    
I suppose I can see how holding any book would seem like a taunt to you.    
- I own a book.
- But I don't think Raymond is remembering the story correctly.    
Alexander didn't see Parmenion as a rival.    
He killed him over a dispute about his son.    
Oh, no, it's Boethius all over again.    
At least you got one thing right.    
You do have a rock hard brain. Because that's bad.    
Everyone knows that a brain should be soft and wet.    
I wanted to say that, but Jake told me not to.    
Yeah, because it's gross.    
There you are.    
- You okay, sir?
- I'm fine.    
I have decided to stop fighting it and lean in to the fact that I'm an idiot.    
Look at me, playing a video game.    
- Oh, which one?
- ""Times"" crossword app.    
Not a video game.    
It plays a little song when you solve it, as if you've just learned to potty.    
[piano music on phone]    
Yes, yes, play me my dunce's tune.    
Okay, so those guys look down on you. So what?    
I mean, Amy's parents look down on me.    
They talk about me right in front of my face in Spanish because they don't think I'm smart enough to learn another language, but I've been taking classes, and now I can understand all the hurtful things they've been saying.    
And how did that help?    
Well, now I know they think I'm short and I was able to do some research and find that     s census that proves I'm above average in height.    
- For     .
- Yeah, I'm taller than the greatest generation.
It doesn't matter.    
The point is, you can use this.    
There are benefits to being underestimated.    
My goodness. You're right.    
There are benefits to being underestimated.    
You can get away with anything.    
Sir? Are you going to kill the dean?    
No. What if the thief was someone we dismissed because they didn't have a classics background?    
Someone who wasn't a professor?    
But what about the footprints?    
The shoes were only given to faculty.    
There was one pair that was unaccounted for: Kevin's.    
They were left at the party...to be cleaned up.    
By Janitor Randy!    
My story solved it. I'm tall.    
Hey, everyone, we would like to say we're sorry for letting this competition get the best of us, and to make it up to you, we figured out what to do for lunch.    
Please, whatever your new idea is, I just don't want to get shot again.    
Ugh, Gary, it was a paintball. Suck it up.    
Isn't this supposed to be an apology?    
Yes. You're right. I'm sorry.    
I mean, I shot my husband with a real bullet two years ago,    
- and it comes up way less than this.
- Way less than this.    
- Guys!
- Right.    
What we're trying to say is that we lost sight of what this was all really about: building morale.    
So we bought two-ply toilet paper for the whole squad.    
- I call shotgun!
- Shotgun!    
Also, I sold the teppanyaki grill and used the money to turn the briefing room into... the lunch zone.    
Oh, no. What's the lunch zone?    
Is it someplace we have to put on a harness and not eat lunch?    
There are no harnesses.    
There are phone chargers and noise-canceling headphones.    
So you can eat your lunch and stare at your phone and you won't have to see or hear anyone you work with.    
- It's perfect.
- It's... it's absolutely perfect.    
We're so glad you like it.    
And just to be sure, I'm not gonna get shot.    
Oh, my God, Gary. Yes! You won't get shot!    
Yeah, I stole those coins.    
Can't believe you bought that whole story.    
They underestimated you, Randy, just as they underestimated Raymond Holt.    
Well, you guys haven't been that great to me either.    
Well, you got to teach people how you want to be treated, Randy. Dr. Phil, RIP.    
The point is, Captain Holt solved the case when no one else could.    
He's actually been stealing from these archives for years.    
You've been asleep at the wheel, Allister.    
- You're an embarrassment.
- Really?    
Well, at least I've never confused    
St. Augustine with Boethius.    
Oh, who gives a rat's ass about Boethius, Wesley?    
What are you doing, Kevin?    
- I am creating a kerfuffle.
- Oh, damn.    
Sure, my husband is a hot piece of ass, but he is so much more than just that.    
Raymond Holt is as smart as anyone in this department, but he chooses to use his intelligence to make our city a better place.    
One day, I hope to live up to the standard you set.    
You make me want to have a wetter brain.    
Oh, Kevin.    
Y'all are hella specific.

[microwave beeping]  
So you guys are gonna tie up the only microwave for    minutes to make a frozen lasagna?  
- Ballsy.
- You ignorant loser.  
First of all, it's not just a frozen lasagna, it's a Mama Magglione's.  
Second of all, it's gonna take     /  minutes.  
The box says   , but we know better than the box.  
You see, this microwave is a KitchenPro Max.   
- Bit of a lightweight.
- It's only  .  kilowatts.   
- Fine for popcorn.
- But we're talking about a Mama Magglione's here.   
Takes a lot to get mama hot.   
She's a real size-queen.   
Well, that started out fun, and here we are at our normal ending place: disgusting.   
Uh-oh. Guys!   
We have a major problem here.   
- No garlic bread.
- Okay, we need to stay calm.   
Let's think. The garlic bread needs to go in the toaster oven with eight minutes left on the lasagna.   
Maybe we could run down to the corner store and make it in time.   
That just gives us    minutes  to go to a place and come back.   
Mama Magglione.   
We have to go now!   
Okay, well, good luck with that, weirdos.   
Stupid piece of crap.   
Rosa, come on.   
You can't break a mouse in half.   
- [mouse crunches]
- Oh, wow, you did.   
Scary. You really earn your rep.   
Stupid Internet. The network's been down all morning, and my girlfriend...   
- Jocelyn.
- Right.   
She's leaving town for two weeks.   
Oh, is Jocelyn leaving town?
Where is Jocelyn going?   
Dude, you forgot her name one time.   
It's not a big deal.
You don't have to keep   
- proving you remember it.
- [laughs]   
That's not what's happening here.   
I'm just saying it a lot, because she's so important to me.   
- Okay, what's her last name?
- Uh-oh.   
- Mm-hmm. It's Pryce.
- Right.   
She's leaving town for two weeks.   
I want to send flowers to her hotel room.   
Aww, that's sweet.   
I wish Amy would send me flowers.   
Why is it taking Holt and this I.T. guy so long to fix the Internet?   
One Police Plaza sent him an hour ago.   
Huh. Why does Holt look so worried?   
What are you talking about?   
He looks exactly like he always does.   
To you, perhaps, but I finally learned how to read his emotions.   
His lips are slightly pursed, and he's blinking at eight-second intervals as opposed to his normal   .   
[gasps] Oh, my God.   
He's having a meltdown.   
""Meltdown"" seems excessive.   
Yeah, it's a meltdown. Mark my words.   
Hey, there, Captain. Everything okay?   
No, I'm having a meltdown.   
Props. That was amazing.   
- Thanks. It was a lot of work.
- This is Sergeant Knox.   
From Cyber Operations.   
He's discovered the reason for our network issues.   
A hacker is attempting to break into our servers.   
Not all of them. Just the LACMI server.   
- Well, that's good.
- No, Captain Holt's nostril   
- just twitched. It's bad.
- It's devastating.   
- Props again.
- Thanks, again.   
The LACMI server holds clearance-protected information, including the names of our undercover agents.   
If it's compromised, people could lose their lives.   
Okay, but isn't the server secure?   
Yes, but the hacker's already used an ARP to resolve the host name with the DNS server.   
Uh-huh. ARP. DNS. Totally following what you're saying.   
Right now, they're trying to get root access by connecting the OSI network to the data-link.   
You know, I'm a bit of a computer nerd myself, but could you, maybe dumb it down a bit for my friends here?   
They're almost through our defenses.   
If we can't stop them, they'll be inside of our server in...   
   minutes.   
Mama Magglione.   
[upbeat music] 
♪ ♪ 
A countdown clock, green text on a black background: we are in full-on action-movie mode.   
Now all I need is my no-nonsense captain to tell me to focus, because time is running out.   
- Peralta.
- Yes?    
You have something in your teeth.    
It's, uh, quite off-putting.    
What? No. ""Time is running out.""    
I fed you your line.    
No one ever has something in their teeth in a movie.    
Watch a movie, stupid Holt.    
Damn it, I tried to remove the server from the chain, but the hacker blocked the protocol.    
Why don't you just unplug it?    
That's what I do any time I'm having computer trouble.    
And also I code a lot. Java, mainframe.    
This guy knows what I'm talking about.    
The NYPD servers have internal backup batteries.    
Even if we unplug them, they'll stay on for another two hours.    
As a captain, I have an override code I can use to wipe the servers clean so there'd be no information for the hackers to steal, but there's one problem, Jake.    
- Yes, sir?
- You still have something in your teeth. You tried to get rid of it, but it's made it much more prominent.    
Why would you stop everything just to tell me that?    
It's very distracting. Anyway, I can't use my override code, because doing so would delete the entire evidence tracking database.    
The NYPD only backs up that information at the precinct level twice a year.    
We would lose four months of evidence.    
So what you're saying is that every perp awaiting trial would walk free?    
Exactly, and we have hundreds of open cases.    
Wiping the servers is not an option.    
The only solution is to track down the hacker.    
How? It could be anywhere in the world...    
Osaka, Berlin, Macau, Stockholm.    
Are you guys just gonna keep letting me list cities    
- I've lived in?
- Wait, the LACMI server isn't wired to the Internet. It's supposed to be offline.    
How are they accessing it?    
They must be going through a physical AP.    
Again, these guys don't get computers like you and I, so...    
It's not a remote connection.    
The hacker's inside the building.    
Let's mobilize.    
Nobody in or out of the building without authorization.    
Check every inch of every floor.    
- And, Jake.
- Oh, let me guess.    
It's on another tooth now.
Is it somehow on my face?    
No, what I was going to say is, we only have   minutes left. You need to focus, because time is running out.    
Oh, yeah.    
That's what the F I'm talking about.    
Thank you, sir.    
- [indistinct chatter]
- What's all this?    
Drunken brawl broke out between to sororities.    
We're keeping the Lambda Nus up here, and the Kappa Gamma Kappas are in holding on two.    
- They're all so mean.
- They're kids, Boyle.    
I'm sure they're just scared.    
Yeah, we're just scared kids. Can we please go home now?    
I'm sorry, we have to process you, but I promise we'll go as fast as we can.    
I hope you get shot in the line of duty.    
- Oh, my God.
- All right.    
Brush it off, Sarge, we've got an emergency.    
There's a hacker in the building.    
Look for anyone you don't recognize using a computer, or plugged in to a port.    
I initiated lockdown protocol.    
I'll search the fourth floor. Peralta, Diaz, start on one, work your way up.    
Jeffords, take Boyle, start on three,    
- work your way down.
- On it.    
I'll grab the keys to the first floor.    
- Smart.
- [cell phone ringing]    
Ames, I love you, but I can't talk right now.    
I just got an alert that the Nine-Nine is on lockdown. 
- I'm on my way.
- Wait, aren't you at the dentist?    
Yeah, I left. It's fine. It's a new hygienist, 
and to be honest, 
her scraping technique was a joke. 
We have    minutes to find a hacker.    
You're not gonna get back in time.    
But everybody else is there, right? 
I mean, it seems weird to have this big thing 
happen without me. 
We talked about this, Amy.    
You have an unhealthy fear of missing out on work.    
- You have FOMOW.
- This isn't FOMOW. 
It's not likeI'm freaking out or anything. 
Out of my way, you old bitch!This cab is mine. 
I'll be there in    minutes. I love you. 
Don't solve it without me. 
I got the keys. Let's go.    
- Jocelyn.
- Jocelyn Pryce, hey.    
What are you doing here?    
Shouldn't you be at the airport?    
Yeah, uh, I wanted to stop and see you on the way there.    
- I think we need to talk.
- Why? Is something wrong?    
I should've done this last night, but I chickened out.    
We need to break up.    
Ugh. Mama Magglione.    
You want to break up?    
But I just met your college friends.    
Are you telling me I had to talk to Matt for nothing?    
- Rosa.
- I thought you liked Matt.    
Matt is a nightmare. He kept saying ""hashtag tell me about it.""    
We should really get going.    
Listen, I just don't understand why this is happening.    
Look, I love being with you, but how often am I actually with you?    
- We're together every night.
- Unless you're at work, or doing work, or thinking about work.    
It's like you never have time for me.    
I'm sorry, but Rosa doesn't have time for you.    
We have a really important work thing.    
That was bad. Let me try rephrasing it.    
You are not as important as Rosa's job.    
Oh, wow. That was way worse.    
Look, we just have to take care of this one thing.    
It's an emergency. Then I'll be right back and we can talk about this.    
I really have to get to the airport.    
- Please.
- Okay, fine.    
But I'm leaving in    minutes.    
Okay, just wait in the break room.    
Don't sit on the couch. It's full of farts.    
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.    
I love being dumped. It's super great.    
I think you're being sarcastic, but it's hard to tell with your voice the way it always is.    
We just checked the third floor. We didn't find anyone.    
- We're on our way to one.
- You didn't even start yet?    
Rosa took a long time getting ready.    
You know how ladies be preppin'.    
Ow! I was just covering up the truth so it wouldn't be awkward.    
Ooh, did something awkward happen?    
I can probably relate. Dish, bish.    
Rosa got dumped out of the blue because she cares so much about her job and doesn't spend enough time with Jocelyn.    
Ow! There's no winning with you.    
Oh, so you got dumped, and you didn't see it coming.    
Oh, brother, you are in Boyle Country.    
Here's what you're gonna want to do.    
- Come on, Boyle.
- Beg her to take you back,    
and don't be afraid to cry. I'm talking tears and snot.    
Quinn, did you get the alert?    
Yeah, but I haven't seen anyone unusual down here.    
I mean, other than  ,    Kappa Gamma Kappas.    
At least you didn't have to deal with Lambda Nus.    
Those girls are savages.    
Right? We're the victims here.    
We have a nighttime event, and if we don't make our blowouts, then we'll all look disgusting, and nobody will give any money to the kids, or dogs, or whatever the charity is.    
It's to buy shoes for poor people so they can get jobs.    
- Yeah.
- We'll do our best,    
but it's possible you're gonna miss your event.    
That's too bad, 'cause you could use some decent shoes.    
What? Terry got these at Aldo.    
- Was it buy one, get one?
- No, it wasn't.    
It was a three-for-one Labor Day doorbuster.    
- Makes sense.
- Come on.    
[cell phone rings]    
Nobody on the fourth floor.    
Three is clear. We're finishing up two. 
I gotta get out of here before the sorority girls notice my tie.    
Just regroup in my office.    
[line trilling]    
- Go for Hitch.
- Hitchcock, damn it.    
I meant to call Peralta.    
We're in the middle of a crisis.    
- Oh, no. Is it the lasagna?
- The what?    
Don't play dumb with me, Raymond.    
What's wrong with the lasagna?    
I have no idea what you're talking about.    
What is it? What's wrong with the lasagna?    
- Is it bubbling over?
- He won't tell me.    
Captain, give us the damned information.    
Is it bubbling over?    
I don't have time for these shenanigans.    
- What's the problem?
- He wouldn't say.    
Oh, no. Then it must be bad.    
Call Jake. He'll tell us the truth.    
[line trills]    
- Hitchcock?
- Give it to us straight, man. 
- What's going on?
- Uh, just searching    
- the first floor.
- Searching the first floor?    
Why is the lasagna on the first floor?    
Why is the lasagna on the first floor?    
What? Are you talking about?
The lasagna is fine.    
Oh, thank God. He says it's fine.    
Oh, you're a saint, Jakey. I love you.    
Okay. Holt's texting me. Love you, too.    
Rosa! We gotta go up to Holt's.    
Is this not done yet? Ugh.    
Jocelyn leaves in eight minutes, and I don't want things to end like this.    
Wow. Way to be vulnerable.    
I thought for sure you'd write her off the second she said she wanted to break up.    
Yeah, I did. She's dead to me.    
Wait? Then why are you so anxious to get back up and talk to her?    
Because I have a plan.    
I'm gonna beg her to stay, change whatever it is I need to change, then once our relationship is stronger than ever, I'm gonna dump her ass so quick.    
It's gonna be brutal.    
Okay, I'm gonna try and put this nicely.    
That is psychotic.    
Okay, maybe not psychotic, but it's like something the lady from ""Killing Eve"" would do.    
Not Sandra Oh, Villanelle. You know, the crazy one who stabs everyone with her hairpin.    
But... have you still not watched ""Killing Eve""?    
I've told you about it so many times.    
Look, I've never lost a breakup, and I'm not starting now. I'm   - .    
I'm always the dumper, never the dumpee.    
I just don't think every breakup has a winner and a loser.    
Sounds like somebody who's lost all his breakups.    
[scoffs] Not all.    
Maybe like half, max. Just... being generous.    
[phone rings]    
Hey, Ames.    
Cab was too slow. Decided to walk. 
It's nice to take a little stroll. 
You're clearly running at full speed.    
Whatever. 
- How's it going there?
- Not great.    
We still haven't found the hacker.    
Oh, super. I mean... oh, no. 
- Is Amy FOMOWing?
- Of course not. 
Big time.    
Okay, I gotta go, babe.
We're headed to Holt.    
Don't you dare hang up on me! 
I am part of this. 
Rosa, this is dumb. I'm just gonna go.    
No, no, no. You promised me more time.    
I still have seven minutes.    
I really don't want to miss my flight, and I cannot physically stand the way that room smells anymore.    
Just breathe through your mouth.    
Please, just stay here.
I'll be right back.    
We searched everywhere.    
- No hacker.
- Maybe he camouflaged himself.    
Maybe he's a real-life Peeta Mellark, out there    
- looking like a river rock.
- I hate to say it, but maybe it's time we start thinking    
- about erasing the server.
- No, not until the last possible minute.    
- What else can you do?
- I've been trying to pinpoint him.    
I've been making my way through the server sockets, trying to determine which port he's plugged into.    
What's going on? I can't hear anything. 
Turn me around. I'm missing everything. 
Part of the team. What's up, team? 
Is Sergeant Santiago suffering from FOMOW?    
- No.
- [mouths words]    
- [distant commotion]
- What's happening?    
I think the hacker just opened the holding cell.    
[women chattering indistinctly]    
Mama Magglione.    
Oh, no. They're running free.    
Everyone, cover up your worst physical attributes.    
It's no use.    
They could always find new ones.    
Why would the hacker open the holding cell?    
Maybe he's trying to create a distraction.    
I think he can see that I'm closing in on his location.    
Then keep doing that. The rest of you, get them back into holding.    
Oh, come on. Get down from there.    
Do you know who my father is? He's in business.    
That's where you actually make money at your job.    
I make money. I make good money.    
That can't be true.    
Otherwise, you wouldn't still have that chin.    
What? Nobody ever said anything about my chin?    
Boyle, is something wrong with Terry's chin?    
- I don't want to get involved.
- Oh, my God. It's true.    
How is she running so fast in those shoes?    
She's too drunk to feel any pain.    
- Open up.
- No.    
You are trapped in a very small room, and we can see you.    
What's your plan here?    
Shut up, I'm trying to think.    
If you come in here, I'll bite you with this weird mouth thing.    
That is a staple remover, and it's shocking you don't know that.    
Sorry, I'm not a secretary.    
I don't have time for this.    
My girlfriend leaves in three minutes.    
You are ruining my life.    
You're ruining my life.    
I missed my Drybar appointment without calling to cancel first.    
They keep record of those things.    
Oh, my God, neither of your lives are being ruined.    
I told you I'm not on board with your psycho plan to destroy your girlfriend.    
I'm not gonna destroy her. I actually want her back.    
I really love her, Jake.    
What? Rosa, then why'd you say all that stuff about winning the breakup?    
Because it's weak and humiliating to love someone.    
I lied to make myself feel strong and normal.    
Right, that's definitely what came across, how normal you were being.    
[door opens]    
Don't let her go.    
You guys, I used to have this boyfriend, Jason, then we broke up 'cause I got drunk at Spring Fling and passed out in a bush, and he took too long to find me, and now he's gone and it's like, there's no one to find me when I pass out in a bush.    
I'm not sure that totally applies here.    
No, she's right.    
I can't let Jocelyn go.    
Can you handle this without me?    
Yeah, it's under control.    
Go get Jocelyn back.    
Jocelyn Pryce.    
Do you need to use a phone to make a call?    
Gross, I don't know any phone numbers.    
Where the hell did Jocelyn go?    
Elevator. Tears and snot.    
- [grunts]
- [scoffs]    
Where are you going? I still have one minute left.    
I'm leaving because it's clearer to me than ever that your job is more important to you than I am.    
That's not true!    
Sorry, ma'am, I can't let anyone in or out.    
She's with me.    
You don't even apologize blow me off.    
You just text ""Double homicide TTYL"".    
Sometimes I add those little heart emojis.    
You know how uncomfortable that is for me.    
I'm sorry. My job is hard.    
Yeah, it is, and it's important, and you help people, but I need more.    
I promise I'll try.    
Honestly, I just don't see it changing.    
Move, move, move!    
Oh, no, why are you outside?    
Is it over? Did we catch the hacker?    
No, I have a personal thing that's more important to me.    
Oh, yeah, work-life balance.
I have that, too.    
- Sorry, I can't...
- Andrew, it's me!    
Come on, come on, come on.    



Got it.    
What?    
- Time check.
- Five minutes, ten seconds.    
- It's over.
- Don't say that.    
We'll never get the garlic bread toasted in time.    
- We can, and we will.
- How?    
We'll set the oven to    .    
Are you insane? It'll burn.    
We'll wrap it in foil.    
The foil will stick to the cheese.    
That's a risk we'll have to take.    
Move it.    
- Hey, you made it.
- Yeah.    
We finally got all the Lambda Nus back into holding.    
Who are the Lambda Nus?    
Doesn't matter.
I'll read your notes later.    
I didn't take any notes.    
What the hell, Jake?
Do you even love me?    
Says the woman who never once sent me flowers.    
Never mind, uh, we still haven't found the hacker, but the cyber guy is getting close.    
Okay, let's check in with Holt.    
Hold on to him, girl.    
He seems pretty sweet, and you guys are like both sevens.    
Oh, come on.    
We only have two minutes left.    
I'm telling you, I can't find him.    
Captain, maybe it's time to face reality.    
We have to erase the servers.    
I'll initiate the sequence for you.    
It just needs your passcode.    
Perhaps you're right. How depressing.    
I never would've thought that typing an intricate sequence of numbers from memory would bring such sadness.    
Hi, I'm Sergeant Santiago.    
I'm sure these guys have told you all about me already.    
Long story short, nothing happens around here without me.    
- [computer chimes]
- What is that?    
We just got an NOS ping from the first floor.    
The hacker is in room    .    
[gasps]    
Mama Magglione.    
Go, go! Room    !    
What are we gonna do?    
It's still frozen in the middle!    
Well, then turn up the temp.    
It's already at    . It's maxed out.    
Then set the mother[bleep] to broil!    
Okay! Geez.    
I thought you said you searched the entire first floor.    
I did. I even checked the ceiling for clingers.    
Hey, who's that guy from Cyber?    
Sergeant Knox. We've been talking computers all day.    
Pretty technical stuff. I kept up.    
His face is really familiar. I can't place him.    
It's empty.    
And there's nothing plugged in to the Internet port.    
But Knox said he got a NOS ping.    
I mean, NOSes don't just ping themselves, guys.    
Jake, stop. You're not fooling anybody.    
You don't anything about computers.    
[scoffs] Oh, my God.    
You're right. I'm not fooling anybody.    
I was fooled, Jakey.
You're my computer boy.    
No, no, no. I don't know anything about computers. None of us do.    
And Knox could tell that.    
So he knew that we wouldn't catch on if he just made stuff up.    
What if the reason we can't find the hacker is because there is no hacker?    
Why would Knox lie about that?    
What if he doesn't actually care what's on the LACMI servers?    
Maybe his real goal is to just trick Holt into erasing all the servers.    
He might just be trying to delete some evidence.    
So you think he's a criminal.    
Oh, my God. We have to go right now.    
I know how I know Knox.    
He's the guy from the security footage in the Avery Street murder.    
Are you sure?    
Yes, he shaved his beard, but it's definitely him.    
- We have less than a minute.
- Call Holt.    
Knox is right next to him.
He'll hear everything.    
Here, I'll text him.    
I don't get it.    
Holt was about to erase the servers.    
If that's what Knox wanted, why did he stop him and say the hacker was in room    ?    
I don't know. Maybe to get rid of us.    
No, to get rid of you.    
The second you showed up in Holt's office, he sent us away and the holding cell doors, they opened when I walked in with Amy on my phone.    
He must've known that she would recognize him.    
Why is this taking so long to send?    
[cell phone chimes]    
What's going on?    
We're running out of time here.    
Uh, sorry, it's uh... from my husband, Kevin.    
Well, all due respect, but you don't have time for that.    
You've got    seconds before the hacker is inside the server.    
Uh, yes, uh... it's just that    
Kevin just texted me some    
hot goss about our favorite reality TV star.    
   seconds.    
Your agents' lives are at stake.    
- Eight, seven...
- Oh, I understand.    
I just have to find out about the hot goss.    
""How certain are you? Sincerely, Raymond Holt.""    
""    percent, sincerely""...    
Why am I doing that part? Send.    
Okay, it said delivered.    
Make way, make way.    
Peralta, Santiago, you'll be happy to know that I did not erase the server.    
Oh, thank God.    
But sad to know that Knox caught on and is now holding me at gunpoint.    
Why not lead with that?    
Nobody has to get hurt.    
Just put your guns down, and put your hands in the air.    
Hey! I said put your guns down, and get your hands in the air.    
The bread, it's gonna burn.    
Guys, do what he says.    
I'll buy you all the garlic bread you want.    
We're gonna hold you to that, Sarge.    
Knox, you're pointing a gun at an NYPD captain.    
Have you really thought this through?    
This is not my fault.    
You were supposed to be at the dentist.    
What? How did you...    
You called me.    
He called me.    
He said he had a tip for the officer in charge of the Avery murder. I said I could meet any time except for this morning because of the dentist.    
I had it all planned out.    
Guess you didn't count on my FOMOW.    
Yeah, that's right. It's crippling.    
Oh, picking a weird time, but I'm glad you're finally owning it.    
Here's what's gonna happen.    
The captain and I are gonna walk out of here real slow.    
No one's gonna move a muscle.    
Everyone's gonna be okay.    
Now we're just gonna move.    
[microwave beeping, siren blaring]    
He's down. He's down. We got him.    
Jeffords, get him into holding.    
With pleasure.    
You're about to have a really bad day.    
Give me that.    
Look at his pants, ladies.    
They're relaxed fit.    
Uh-oh. Is that a braided belt?    
Whoa, what happened?    
You know what, forget it. I'll just read Amy's notes.    
Why aren't you guys on your way to the airport?    
Oh, I'm gonna miss my flight, but it's worth it.    
It means a lot that Rosa bailed on all this just for me.    
- Aww.
- You did what, Diaz?    
Now, sir, I told her it was okay.    
If you're gonna be mad at anyone, be mad at me.    
Okay, I am mad at you.    
What? No.    
I didn't think you were really gonna be mad.    
That's... that backfired. Be mad at Rosa.    
Worst morning ever.    
Yeah, it was stressful, but we got the guy.    
Surprised you two are taking it so hard.    
We were talking about our lunch, you self-absorbed son-of-a-bitch.    
- Come on.
- Look at this bread.    
It's completely inedible.    
There's not even any soft parts in the middle we can pull out.    
Title of your s*x tape?    
We cooked that lasagna for nothing.    
- Nothing!
- Okay.    
But have you ever considered eating lasagna with no garlic bread?    
We've...    
Never done that before.    
I guess maybe we could give it a try.    
What do you think, Hitchcock?    
What the hell.    
I had a feeling something crazy was gonna happen today.    
There you go.    
It's almost ready.    
[microwave dings]    
Mama Magglione.    
_    
Mmm. Mmm.

 Your videos changed my life!
 [four voices at once.]
 Changed my life!
 You are my qu-qu-queen!
 [speaking Italian.]
 - [loud chortling.]
 - No, Italian girl.
 We are changing the world, for we are the G-Hive.
 And today we are celebrating our 1 millionth subscriber.
 Over 1 million people are living their lives according to the Gina-mandments.
 They're like the Ten Commandments, only there's more and they're better.
 I would now like to express my gratitude the best way I know how through song.
 Gratitude [all harmonizing.]
 Grati-tat-tat-tat tatitude!
 Grati-tat-tat-tat-tatitude!
 Gratitude.
 [upbeat music.]
 Guys?
 Guess who I just got off the phone with.
 My cousin Pam.
 What?
 No.
 Why would you think that?
 You always seemed kind of jealous of my relationship with him, so I thought maybe you called him up to settle your differences.
 I'm definitely not jealous of Pam.
 He owns a bird shop.
 I barely remember him.
 You remember the bird shop.
 It wasn't Pam.
 No, I was actually talking to none other than Gina Linetti.
 Really?
 No one's heard from her in months.
 Well, she just invited us to go check out her new place.
 I'm surprised you're so excited to see her.
 I mean, she's been blowing you off ever since she left.
 - What?
 In what way?
 - She bailed - on your birthday drinks.
 - It wasn't that fun.
 She was a no-show at your Secret Santa party!
 Christmas is overrated.
 - She hasn't called you in months!
 - I'm not that interesting.
 Look, what is going on with you?
 - Are you hangry?
 - No.
 I just ate six hardboiled eggs.
 Well, maybe you should've made it a cool ""doz.
 "" Look, I know Gina hasn't been around very much, but we're gonna spend time with her today, and it's gonna be just like old times.
 Gina's gonna be a few minutes.
 Her photo shoot is running over.
 Yes, Moses!
 Lookin' good!
 Now work those Commandments!
 See, Sarge?
 Just like old times.
 Ah, Boyle, there you are.
 I have a question for you.
 Daddy, wait up!
 Oh, your non-adult is at our place of work Nikolaj had a half-day at school for Mariano Rivera's birthday.
 I'm watching him on my lunch break.
 Nikolaj, say ""hi"" to Captain Holt.
 Hi, Captain Holt!
 How's Mr.
 Kevin?
 Stressed.
 His annual budget review is today, and a recent change in federal policy means his grant situation is tenuous.
 - At best.
 - Okay.
 Hey Nikolaj, Daddy and Captain Holt need to talk.
 Why don't you go do some drawing?
 Oh, he loves doing art.
 He made a portrait of our dog Biscuit that had all of his surgical scars.
 Yes.
 Children are wonders.
 I'm conducting a statistical analysis to get a more nuanced understanding of which areas in our jurisdiction need greater police presence with a hope of developing a formula that What on Walden Pond is this?
 Nikolaj, no, that's important!
 I'm so sorry, sir.
 I don't spank him, but I will reprimand him in my own way.
 Niko.
 I love you.
 - I'm so sorry, Daddy!
 - No, no, no.
 He didn't ruin it, he solved it.
 The absolute value of psi.
 Nikolaj cracked the equation.
 Boyle your boy is a genius!
 Jacob!
 Terrencio!
 Give Moses a hug!
 [moans.]
 Uhh!
 It's so good to see you!
 Ugh, that shoot took forever.
 Did Janelle offer you a snack?
 She did.
 I had Linguini.
 So what's been going on with you?
 Well, that's actually why I called.
 It's not a big deal at all, but someone's threatening to murder me.
 - What?
 - Damn, Gina!
 I mean, I'm not worried about it in the slightest.
 Anyone who has an online presence gets meaningless threats.
 It actually is a sign that I made it.
 - Congrats?
 - Thanks, thank you.
 The only thing is, I have my first speaking engagement tomorrow and the organizer says he's going to cancel it unless I have police protection, so would you guys come tomorrow and police protect me?
 - Yes, of course, yes.
 - Oh, thanks so much.
 [phone jingle plays.]
 This is my agent.
 I'm so sorry.
 Duncan, this better be good news.
 Oh, it is your video's huge, from Spokane to Spain, you're global, Gines!
 Now, let's.
 Talk.
 Strategy.
 This is gonna take a while.
 Do you guys want to get drinks at Shaw's later and catch up?
 Oh, yeah.
 That sounds really fun.
 Great.
 I'll see you then!
 - Okay.
 - So, Duncs, I have an idea for a second book.
 It's a memoir, and it's made of memes.
 So, it's called a meme-oir.
 Whoa, Rosa!
 What happened?
 I touched poison oak.
 The doctor says I have to keep my hands bandaged for a week so I don't scratch them.
 - How did it happen?
 - I was on a nature hike and I went off-trail to pick a pretty little flower.
 Shut up.
 Now scram.
 I have a case report to type up.
 Uh, there's no way you're using a keyboard with your hands like that.
 Oh, I could help you!
 Not to brag, but at typing camp, everyone called me ""The Finger Queen.
 "" Oh, my God, that sounds really dirty.
 I swear that's what it meant.
 Yeah, it was typing camp.
 Nobody thinks that.
 Anyway, I don't need your help.
 You're really gonna try to make it through an entire day on your own?
 Well, well, well.
 Rosa Diaz is finally gonna learn the lesson that no matter how strong she is on her own, true strength comes from accepting help from others That's not what's happening.
 Mm-hmm, yeah.
 That's how normal people take their coats off.
 I'm fine.
 - I can see that.
 - This is going well.
 Clearly.
 [exhales.]
 Why are you sliding into my side of the booth?
 Because that side is the solo side.
 You always put the person you want catch up with on the solo side, otherwise one of us will spend the whole night straining our necks looking sideways.
 I'm straining my neck talking to you right now.
 Okay, so don't look at me, Terry.
 Just face forward.
 You see me every day.
 - Fine.
 - Fine.
 I gotta say, I'm surprised Gina invited us to drinks tonight.
 She obviously invited us over to her place because she needed a favor.
 Why are you still so down on her?
 I've been through this before.
 In college, I had a football buddy, Bryant Ungerbert Oh, lemme guess.
 You guys were best friends, then he got drafted into the NFL, - and now you never talk.
 - No, he got drafted into the Canadian football league, became a long snapper for Ottawa, and even that level of success ruined our friendship.
 He's still playing?
 How is that possible?
 You're 35 to 60 years old.
 It's Canada.
 They don't tackle as hard.
 Anyway, his career became the only thing that mattered.
 He was off doing photo shoots, commercials, speaking at long snapping conventions - Is that a thing?
 - In Canada, it's like the Oscars.
 Look, the point is he stopped making time for his friends.
 Fine, but that's not what's happening here.
 Nothing has changed with Gina.
 - She's not an Ungerbert.
 - Hi.
 So, Gina won't be able to make it tonight.
 She doesn't have time.
 But here are your credentials for tomorrow's event.
 Have a great night.
 Oh, no.
 She is an Ungerbert.
 Hey, Gina's prepping inside.
 You get some rest last night?
 Yeah, because I got home from our 9:30 drinks at 9:41.
 I was in bed by 10:00.
 Then I looked at my phone for another two hours, so actually I didn't sleep very well.
 But I did realize something.
 The only thing that matters to Gina is work.
 You don't say?
 Where have I heard that before?
 I don't know, Terry.
 I don't have time for your weird memory lapse.
 I said it last night.
 Well, I wish you would've said it to me.
 Anyway, I decided I'm not gonna let it go this time After we update her on the case, - I'm gonna say something to her.
 - Good.
 I wish I'd have said something to Ungerbert.
 Long snapper used to be my favorite position.
 - Really?
 - Yeah.
 Hmm.
 Well you a weirdo.
 TimothÃ©e Chalamet, shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.
 TimothÃ©e Chalamet, shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.
 - Gina.
 - Oh, sorry.
 - I'm doing my vocal warm-up.
 - Great.
 Well, cyber looked into the threats, and they traced a number of negative comments back to another internet celebrity, Marvin Lennox.
 Marvin Lennox.
 Yeah, I'm not worried about him.
 - He's an inspirational baker.
 - Inspirational baker?
 What the hell is that?
 A man is like a quiche, and a quiche is only as strong as its crust.
 What's your crust?
 Oh, that's exactly what it sounds like.
 Yeah, he's not a threat.
 He lives in Utah, and again, just to remind you inspirational baker.
 Right.
 Well, even so, we have metal detectors at all of the entrances, and we'll keep our eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
 Also, before we head in there, I wanted to talk to you about something.
 - What's up?
 - Well, it just kind of bummed me out that last night you blew us off.
 For work.
 Again.
 What?
 Uh, no.
 I did not miss drinks for work.
 I had food poisoning.
 Did Janelle not tell you?
 - No.
 - Wow, that's crazy.
 'Cause I specifically told her to tell you you know what?
 - I'm gonna fire her.
 - You don't have to do that.
 - Janelle.
 - Oh, God, doing it now?
 - Hi, Gina.
 - Okay.
 Well, Sarge and I should probably hit it, get back in there, survey some people.
 But have a great show.
 Janelle, just remember you're gonna have a lot of jobs in your life this is but a blip on your rÃ©sumÃ©.
 Okay Sarge, let's go.
 Wanted to see me, sir?
 Yes, I wanted to talk to you about Nikolaj.
 How long have you known he was a genius?
 I mean, I always knew he was bright.
 I just never realized he was that smart Well, there's no sugarcoating it.
 - You're a terrible father.
 - What?!
 You've been asleep at the wheel, man!
 What have you done to cultivate his incredible mind?
 - I read to him every night.
 - Shakespeare?
 Tolstoy?
 - No, nothing that advanced.
 - Egads, are you reading him Dickens?
 - Yes?
 - Boyle!
 My father never saw my potential.
 In grade school, I wanted to spend all my free time drawing graphs and charts, but he insisted I play basketball.
 As if I care about slam dunking a three-pointer.
 Don't be my father, Boyle!
 I wouldn't dare!
 What do you think I should do?
 Let me tutor Nikolaj.
 Nothing too strenuous.
 Maybe some geometry, statistical mechanics, perhaps some Latin lyric poetry thrown in for fun.
 Oh, I don't know.
 He's really booked.
 I guess I could cancel his cartooning class, - but he really loves it.
 - Don't do that.
 I hate to think of all the great cartoons humanity missed out on because Einstein was just too busy reinventing physics.
 Okay, I'll cancel the class.
 I mean, who needs relativity when we could've had Einstein's take on lasagna-eating cats.
 - I said I'd cancel.
 - Did he hate Mondays?
 We'll never know.
 Okay, I'm going, I'm going!
 [light music.]
 Ugh, why won't this dumb monitor turn on?
 Because you can't work without your hands.
 Trust us.
 If you could do this job without lifting a finger, we would've already cracked it.
 Because we're lazy boys.
 I'm just not doing it hard enough.
 - [grunts.]
 Mmm!
 - Ooh!
 That's a double-sponger.
 All right.
 I am cleaning this up, and no one is helping me.
 Not a problem.
 Because we're lazy boys.
 You gotta be kidding me!
 - [crowd murmuring.]
 - In the beginning, there was nothing.
 And then God, a woman, said, ""Let there be Gina!"" [pulsing dance music.]
 Gina!
 Please look at me!
 [gasps.]
 [screaming.]
 You're welcome.
 Aaaaah!
 It's gonna be hard to spot a crazy person in here.
 - They're all crazy.
 - Tell me about it.
 This is more insane than the crowd at the Carly Rae Jepsen I mean Slayer concert.
 G-Hive!
 Are you ready for three new Gina-mandments?
 - [cheering.]
 - Number one.
 You can be anything you set your mind to as long as you're already great at it!
 Number two.
 No one knows you can't take it with you!
 Be buried with your money.
 Cha-ching!
 Number three.
 If you fall down nine times you gotta reassess your walking, 'cause something's wrong.
 And now, I wanna hear from you, my baby G-Hive!
 Yes, girl in the mustard sweater.
 Hi, Gina.
 I just quit my job and left my husband who loves parkour more than he loves me.
 And it's all because of your Gina-mendment: ""If the light in your house is dim, change the bulb.
 "" Yes!
 I have time for 15 more compliments.
 Hey, Jake.
 I think Lennox is here.
 I see him.
 You get him.
 I'll stick with Gina.
 Uh-oh.
 He's moving.
 [stammering.]
 Coming through.
 There's too many hoodies.
 I lost him.
 - Get Gina out of here, now!
 - And now the time has come for yall to meditate.
 Close your eyes while I sing to you.
 Breathe in, breathe out I invented meditation - R - Gina, we gotta go.
 - Lennox is here.
 - Told you I'm not worried about Lennox.
 Well, it's not your call.
 - We're leaving.
 - Jake, you're overreacting.
 [loud crack.]
 [crowd commotion.]
 On second thought, maybe we should get out of here.
 - Okay.
 Kitchen's all clear.
 - Bedroom's clear.
 Can't believe I just escaped death!
 I haven't felt this alive since I almost got killed by that bus.
 I know, right?
 What a rush.
 Feel just like Kevin Costner in ""The Bodyguard""!
 What?
 If anyone's like Kevin Costner it's me.
 I'm the one carrying Gina!
 Well, I think we can agree we were both Kevin Costner.
 - No!
 - Jake, that was so dope when you were like, ""Clear a path!"" - [phone chimes.]
 - Guys, uniformed officers found Marvin hiding in a bathroom at the event space.
 He's in custody.
 We got him!
 That's great!
 I hope they give him the chair.
 Ooh, we should celebrate.
 Champagne's in the fridge.
 On it.
 [phone chiming.]
 Duncan, I almost died.
 It was amazing.
 I heard all about it, Gines.
 Look, you're trending!
 And from my pain comes triumph!
 Love that.
 And we can use this publicity to get more money out of those bottled water guys.
 You really impressed them at drinks last night!
 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah we should talk about this later.
 Sorry, you're breaking up.
 Look, I said they loved you at the drinks last night the drinks last night that you had with the water people?
 Crap, I just hit the Holland Tunnel, but again, [volume decreasing.]
 great job with the drinks last night!
 [distantly.]
 Bye.
 Jake, did you hear that?
 I did, and there's been a change of plans.
 I'm gonna take a rain check on the champagne, but it was wonderful seeing you.
 Why are you talking like a flight attendant?
 This is how I always talk when everything is okay.
 Which it is right now.
 Please enjoy the rest of your day.
 How did Nikolaj do?
 Were you able to overcome - my horrible parenting?
 - No, it's far worse than I could've ever imagined.
 I showed him a periodic table, and he thought it was a coloring book illustration.
 I blame myself.
 It's such a classic Boyle trait not to recognize talent.
 My cousin Susan didn't know she could sing until her late 40s.
 Honestly, given the hole that you've put him in, he needs more expert help than I can provide.
 But, there is a boarding school in Switzerland that would be a perfect fit for him.
 He can enroll immediately.
 In Switzerland?
 I'd never see him.
 Then uproot your life and move there with him.
 No one here would miss you.
 Hmm.
 We could live in Gruyere, the fondue capital of the world.
 Oh, I don't know.
 It's such a big change.
 Well, he's the genius.
 Why don't we ask him what he wants to do?
 Good point.
 Niko?
 We need to talk.
 Wait.
 Why is he writing the solution to my formula for no reason?
 And why is he drawing colorful underpants beneath it?
 Oh, I see what's happening.
 He's drawing Boy Riga, loyal sidekick to his favorite cool superhero, Captain Latvia.
 That's his symbol.
 He distributes grain evenly among the working class.
 Uh-huh.
 I see.
 So this was all just some coincidence.
 He wasn't writing absolute value of psi.
 He was just doodling.
 [light music.]



 [grunts.]
 Aaaah!
 [screaming and grunting.]
 Raaah!
 Uhhh!
 Ahhh!
 Rosa?
 Are you stuck in there?
 No, I'm in here by choice.
 Oh, 'cause I hear some banging noises as if someone was struggling to open the door.
 No.
 That was the pipes.
 Or, is it the sound of you learning how to ask for help?
 You know, you can't spell ""independent"" without ""dependent.
 "" And you can't spell ""Go [bleep.]
 yourself"" without ""[bleep.]
 you.
 [bang.]
 Jake, I had a work thing.
 I can't believe you're being such a baby about this.
 I'm not being a baby.
 Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?
 It was a big opportunity for me.
 I was having drinks with the brand director of a bottled water company.
 I can't say which one, but it rhymes with, ""fart water.
 "" Perhaps one day I will laugh at that.
 In the meantime, I'm happy for all your success.
 I hope your partnership with ""fart water"" is very fruitful.
 - Good day.
 - Come on, dude.
 - Just talk to me.
 - I would if we were friends, but you're making it it very clear that we are not, so I shan't.
 - Oh, you're shanting me?
 - Yeah, that's right.
 - Jake!
 - Can't hear you.
 - You're shanted!
 - Jake!
 I told you I only talk to my friends.
 No, Jake.
 I think I just got stabbed by that guy.
 Oh, yeah, ya did.
 Ya definitely did.
 Okay.
 The ambulance is on its way.
 They said not to remove the knife.
 Great.
 What's up?
 I got your text Oh, my God, Gina, there's a knife in you!
 Jake, did you stab Gina?
 I didn't stab Gina, okay?
 Lennox wasn't our guy.
 The real perp did it.
 He's in a black hoodie and jeans.
 He ran that way.
 - I'm on it.
 - I want you to stay calm and just try to keep all of your blood - inside your body.
 - Bitch, what do you think I'm doing?
 Yeah, I don't know why I said that.
 Bring your ass down here so we can finish our conversation.
 We can do that later, Gina.
 First of all, I have so much adrenaline pumping through my body right now I can feel almost nothing.
 Secondly, you can't say no to me.
 - I have a knife in my back.
 - Yeah, that tracks.
 Okay, fine.
 So I was saying that ever since you left you've been kind of a crappy friend.
 Brrrrrawwwwwwoo.
 We're definitely not having this conversation right now.
 No, it's okay.
 It just hurt for a sec.
 Come on, let's do it.
 Ugh.
 All right, fine, what was I saying?
 You were saying that I'm a [groans.]
 Ahh, bad friend.
 [blowing.]
 Right.
 You're a bad friend.
 That's what I was saying to you.
 - Yeah.
 - And just that, you know, you've been really blowing me off for the last few months, and last night you lied to me about being sick.
 - That really sucked.
 - All right, well, listen.
 I'm sorry I lied, Jake.
 I saw you were getting upset and I didn't want to hurt you.
 But I don't know what to say about the other stuff because this is my life and I don't want to apologize for that.
 No, and Gina, you shouldn't have to.
 Look, I'm really proud of you.
 You're totally killing it.
 Yeah, people want to stab me.
 I mean, that's a very positive way of - looking at things, but yeah.
 - Thank you.
 Ha ha ha ha-ha!
 Hoo hoo!
 I hit a new level of pain Please keep talkin', please keep talkin'!
 Okay, look.
 I just wanted you to know that I miss you.
 Well, I miss you too dude.
 Great, so can we agree to see each other like 5% more?
 Deal.
 Aah!
 [strangled moaning.]
 We're not going to shake it.
 Yeah, we'll just take each other at our word.
 Oooh!
 That's a knife!
 That is a knife in my back.
 That's so weird to say.
 There's a knife in my back.
 Boyle, may I speak with you for a minute?
 Sure, I was just googling ""good toys for normal children.
 "" Nikolaj may not be a genius, but he's a very bright child.
 And on top of that, you were right.
 He's also a very gifted artist.
 Look what he did to my periodic table.
 Sure, it's a bit derivative of Kandinsky, but the palette shows an impressive comprehension of color theory.
 And he's good at clouds, too.
 Okay.
 I also wanted to say I was wrong to imply that you didn't know what was best for him.
 Oh.
 You're an exceptionally supportive parent, and I wish my father had been more like you.
 Thank you for saying that.
 And sir, nothing would make me prouder than being your big daddy.
 Well, we're off track now.
 So, uh, good day.
 Hey, guys.
 How you feeling, Gina?
 Sometimes I feel like a nut, sometimes I don't.
 Almond Joy's got nuts.
 Mounds don't.
 She's very hopped up on painkillers.
 Hold up, when did you learn French, Monsieur La baguette?
 [in French accent.]
 Oh, as a bÃ©bÃ©.
 Oh, oui!
 Oui, oui, oui, oui.
 It actually helps to play along, I'm assuming.
 So what's the latest?
 Did you catch the perp?
 No.
 I almost had him.
 But then he jumped up, grabbed a flagpole, spun around it like Spider-Man, and then flipped out of sight on a roof.
 It was crazy.
 Officers are still patrolling the area.
 Oh, my God, that's it.
 That is it!
 The treasure is in the Forest of Enchanted Secrets!
 - Let's go!
 - No, we can't.
 We have to stay here and guard the Amulet of Destiny.
 True dat, true dat.
 Sarge, call me crazy, but it almost sounds like whoever stabbed Gina knew parkour just like the ex-husband of that lady from Gina's event.
 Right!
 Gina convinced her to leave him and he probably wants revenge.
 - I'll look into it.
 - Okay.
 Jake, I cannot wait for this doctor.
 Will you please grab this knife out of my back?
 - Get it!
 - Gina, it's already out.
 What?
 [buzzing.]
 - Hello?
 - You win.
 - Please help me.
 - No.
 What, why?
 I learned my lesson.
 - You were right.
 - No, you were right.
 For the past four hours, I've been watching you on the security camera.
 You have?
 That's weird.
 - This isn't about me.
 - Still seems weird.
 Rosa!
 Watching you try to open that door and fail again and again and again and again was inspiring!
 I was trying to teach you a lesson, and instead, you taught me a lesson.
 Great.
 What lesson is that?
 There is nothing the human spirit cannot overcome.
 So Rosa Diaz, you are not quitting.
 You are gonna open that door because you are badass and you don't need help from anyone!
 Yeah.
 I'm Rosa Diaz.
 [inspiring music.]
 You can do this, Rosa!
 [slow motion groaning.]
 Uhhhhh!
 She's doing it!
 [click.]
 [continues groaning.]
 Uhhhhhh!
 Yes!
 Uhhhhh!
 [both yelling.]
 - You did it!
 - I did it!
 Oh, that was great!
 I love being independent - I have to go to the bathroom.
 - Oh, okay, I'll help you.
 And then you were like, ""We can use the Amulet to fight the Queen of Tears!"" I said all of that when I was on drugs?
 That's brilliant.
 Yeah, we basically came up with an entire amazing story.
 - We should write a movie!
 - Yes!
 Jake and Gina present, colon, ""The Queen of Tears,"" colon, ""Battle for the Amulet of Destiny. "" Colon, Part One, colon, of Five.
 Oh, get those sequel profits smart.
 - Yerp.
 - Oh, here comes Terry.
 - Hey, sorry I'm late.
 - Oh, you should be, Terrance.
 You almost missed the surprise we got for you.
 - Huh, what is it?
 - I think you mean, ""Who is it?"" Bryant Ungerbert?
 Hello, Terry Jeffords.
 It's been far too long, old friend.
 We did the right thing.
 - Yes we did, Gina.
 - Who's Gina?
 Are you still on drugs?
 - Yeeeah.
 - Oh, tight.

06x16 - Cinco De Mayo

Hey, hey hey!
 It's the best day of the year.
 Happy Cinco de Mayo!
 I don't think you're allowed to wear a poncho to work, Hitchcock.
 Let's fiesta!
 [BAND PLAYING ""THE MEXICAN HAT SONG"".]
 Oh, you got a band.
 Stop, stop!
 No trumpets!
 Not today!
 My head is killing me!
 Hit the tequila a little early, huh?
 I'm not hung over, Hitchcock.
 I've got a tension headache.
 I've got the Lieutenant's exam tonight.
 I'm stress-eating like crazy.
 I had ten hard-boiled egg yolks this morning.
 - Gross.
 - You're having a high-grade pre-test freak out.
 I've been there.
 March 13, 2001.
 AP Calc test Ames, I hate to cut you off, but we all know where this story's going.
 Oh, yeah?
 You know that I crapped my pants in the middle of the test?
 Oh my God, no, I thought you were just gonna say you got a B+ or something.
 - More like a BM.
 - Noice.
 Come on, now Terry's worried about his test and his bowels!
 What you need, Sergeant, is to distract yourself.
 NPR has a riveting six hour interview with Eileen Moon Myers.
 Nobody knows who that is.
 Nobody knows the Associate Principal Cellist in the New York Philharmonic?
 [SNORTS.]
 Okay.
 Wait!
 I've got it!
 I know how to distract Terry.
 Captain, remember how you cancelled the last Halloween heist because there was that emergency gas line explosion and you said we had to ""help out""?
 Yes, I also remember you refusing to believe the explosion was real.
 Go back to acting school, buddy.
 You're way overselling the pain here.
 No one's buying it!
 Well, it's not like I was the only one who thought it was fake.
 And the Oscar goes to Trent!
 You said that we should reschedule the heist for another day, so why not today?
 To help distract Terry?
 Yes!
 And I would love to defend my crown after I destroyed you all last year.
 Well, I mean, the proposal was all part of my plan.
 All I remember is you bowing to me on your knees.
 Yeah, I was asking you to marry me.
 Well, you look like a fool.
 Neither of you won because Jake swapped out the real championship cummerbund - Belt.
 - For the treacly proposal one.
 What?
 I thought everyone loved that I used the heist to do the proposal.
 You are wrong everyone hated it but it helped me win.
 During your engagement celebration, I snuck back - and found the original cummerbund.
 - Belt.
 It's hanging up in my living room at home.
 I never thought I'd say this, but enough foreplay!
 Are we heisting or not?
 - Yes!
 - Of course!
 Wait, I will only do this under one condition.
 Sergeant Jeffords agrees that this will help his nerves.
 Yeah, I mean, I would like to take my mind off the test.
 And maybe I'll win this year!
 Ah, the heist is already working.
 Sergeant Jeffords has recovered his sense of humor.
 - [LAUGHTER.]
 - Hey!
 All right, but for real, though.
 Are we doing this?
 - We're doing this!
 - Heist!
 - Heist!
 - Heist!
 It's a Cinco de Mayo heist!
 A Cinco de Mayo heist makes just as much sense as Halloween!
 - Let's do it!
 - [UPBEAT MUSIC.]
 Welcome one and all to the first ever Cinco de Mayo Halloween Heist 6!
 We're still working on the title.
 - No need, I love it!
 - Thank you, Charles.
 Now, before we go any further, we should probably choose an item to steal.
 Does anyone have anything valuable on them?
 Maybe some jewelry?
 I have a medical alert bracelet that tells people my name and address, in case I have a brain collapse.
 Perfect, this year's champion will be whoever's in possession of Scully's very upsetting bracelet at midnight tonight.
 - I take my test at 6:30.
 - You know what, Terry?
 You're kind of making this a nightmare.
 Maybe you just shouldn't participate So this really isn't about helping out Sergeant Jeffords?
 - What?
 - I guess I'm out.
 But no, no, no, no, come on.
 Of course I'm 100% in support of Terry.
 In fact, I'm going to team up with him.
 [LAUGHS.]
 Let's do this!
 You are so easily manipulated.
 Now you're stuck with Sergeant Dumb Dumb.
 - Damn it.
 - Hey.
 Santiago, shall we join forces?
 Ooh, smart, teaming up with the reigning champ.
 Again with this nonsense?
 I'm the reigning champ.
 The only thing you won last heist was a lifetime of mediocre heterosexual intercourse with Jake.
 [GASPS.]
 How dare you.
 No one thinks you won last year.
 Wow, really thought the ""how dare you"" was going to be linked to his mean s*x comment, but okay.
 Right, sorry.
 I'll have you know Jake and I wear each other out every single night.
 Good lord, overcompensating.
 You know what?
 Maybe we just shouldn't talk about this at work.
 I'm texting Kevin to bring the cummerbund.
 You'll see who the real winner is, you braggy breeders.
 A lot of infighting.
 Not too late to ditch Amy and team up with this pussycat burglar.
 Please, Boyle, your only value was you had a doppelganger which no longer matters since Bill died in that accident.
 - RIP, Bill.
 - So sad.
 I can still be useful without Bill!
 No hole's too tight for these tiny tips.
 - [GROANING.]
 - For stealing stuff!
 - [SIGHS.]
 - Well, fine.
 Looks like I'll just team up with my friend Rosa.
 I'm out.
 Five heists was enough.
 We've exhausted every possibility of this thing.
 Literally nothing new can happen.
 It's boring.
 You can have a long lunch with me instead.
 Ooh, lunch?
 The devil's breakfast.
 - Well, forget it.
 - Okay, I won't call it that!
 I just want to be included in something!
 Okay, that whole lunch thing was clearly a ploy.
 But even still, I'm not worried about losing to Boyle.
 No one is.
 He's a joke.
 All right, let's get this thing going.
 Scully will be locked in the supply closet with his bracelet.
 Can I lie down on the floor?
 Uh, yeah.
 You can do whatever you want.
 And you're already on the ground.
 With Hitchcock.
 And you both have pillows.
 Best day ever!
 There.
 Now they're locked in.
 Arrange your affairs.
 The heist begins in five minutes.
 Five minutes?
 But this whole thing was so last second!
 I don't even have any plans or supplies!
 I have so many plans and supplies.
 I even have a victory banner that unfurls with a voice command.
 I can't say what, but it's so cool.
 I thought this was a spur-of-the-moment fun way to distract me from freaking out about my exam!
 Well, it wasn't exactly hard to predict, Sarge.
 Your catchphrase is ""Terry hates tests.
 "" It's true.
 Terry hates tests!
 But the point is, I planned everything, starting with Scully's bracelet.
 It had to be the prize because I have prepared the greatest reveal in heist history.
 Allow me to introduce you to Other Scully.
 Hi, I'm Earl, Norm's twin brother.
 - [MIMICKING EXPLOSION.]
 - Why's Scully never mentioned he had a twin before?
 Because no one talks about their siblings with coworkers.
 I've told you about my brother Lawrence.
 Nope, and I don't want to learn about him and I already forgot his name.
 Now let's go.
 It's time to heist!
 No movement yet.
 So here's our plan.
 After watching everyone coo over your maudlin proposal, I've decided we should employ a similar diversion.
 - Smart, I'm in.
 - You will tell Jake you are pregnant with his child.
 What?
 I'm not pregnant.
 Here is a positive pregnancy test and a sonogram of your fetus.
 Congratulations.
 It's a girl.
 Feels a little mean to play with Jake's feelings - like that, sir.
 - You're right, it is mean.
 Too bad.
 As your mentor I command you to do it.
 Wow, okay.
 Perhaps we should discuss some other options.
 There's no time, look.
 Peralta's going for the bracelet!
 How'd he get him free so quickly?
 See ya later, losers!
 Not so fast!
 - [TASER CRACKLING.]
 - [GRUNTING.]
 What the hell was that?
 That Fitbit I gave you at Christmas?
 I modified it into a taser.
 What?
 Do you even want me to get into shape?
 Yeah, but not as much as I want to win.
 Buzz buzz, bitch.
 I've got Scully.
 Come on, let's go.
 - [TASER CRACKLING.]
 - [MUFFLED SHOUT.]
 No!
 Nooo!
 Yes.
 Fake heist went perfectly.
 So did the real heist.
 Why is your face twitching like that?
 Oh, Amy tased me a bunch.
 I bit my own tongue.
 It was awesome.
 Was it hard to get through the door?
 No.
 I'm strong as hell.
 The hard part was getting this bracelet off Scully's wrist.
 How can you even feel your hand with this thing so tight?
 You're supposed to feel your hand?
 Well, that's terrifying.
 Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to hide the old bracelet and win me this heist.
 Don't you mean win us this heist?
 Oh, Terrence, unfortunately I do not.
 - What the hell?
 - Sorry, Sarge.
 - It had to be this way.
 - Why?
 The banner only has my name on it.
 It's really all about the banner.
 It unfurls by a voice command.
 But I promise that I will mention both you and Earl Scully in my victory speech.
 - Wait, Earl's here?
 - Yeah.
 He helped us with the heist.
 I told that son of a bitch never to show his face in New York again!
 Why are you running towards the glass?
 [GLASS SHATTERS.]
 You're a dead man, Earl!
 That's not great.
 You're a dead man, Jake!
 Uh, that's much worse.
 Squirt more lube and help me yank.
 Ugh, you know that fun braggy recap we do at the end of each win?
 Can we leave this part out?
 [GRUNTS.]
 Yes.
 We'll make up a cooler thing.
 But for now, we lube and yank.
 Wrap your legs around him to anchor yourself.
 Yep.
 Here we go.
 [GRUNTING, SCREAMING.]
 Earl?
 Earl!
 Norm?
 - Norm?
 - What the I'm so happy your friend invited me to I told you what would happen if I ever saw you again, Earl.
 What is going on?
 What am I looking at?
 Scully has a twin brother named Earl.
 Jake brought him here to trick you.
 Thank you for the ride, Terrence.
 Apparently they don't get along very well.
 We did get along.
 We were inseparable, until Earl slept with my wife.
 It's not my fault she wanted to have s*x with a stud instead of a dud.
 Stud?
 Your face looks it's been kicked in by a horse!
 Well, your mouth looks like a butthole!
 Your whole body looks like a butthole.
 And you look identical.
 [GRUNTING.]
 [GURGLING.]
 Should we help Scully?
 I'm not touching this.
 [GRUNTING.]
 [SCREAMS.]
 There's nowhere to run, Earl!
 Well, that was a real mind eff.
 - Good-bye.
 - Just so you know, Jake has the bracelet in his pocket.
 Why would you tell them that?
 We're a team!
 - You locked me up.
 - Yeah, but they didn't know that!
 There's no bracelet in his pocket!
 What?
 There should be.
 Where'd it go?
 - Shalom, partner.
 - Dope.
 And you thought Shlomo Ben-Yisrael - wouldn't come through.
 - No, I said the name and the costume were offensive, bordering on actionable.
 Well, it worked.
 Jake brought in Scully's twin just like I planned when I connected them on Facebook, but he had no idea they hated each other.
 And when everyone was fighting, they were too distracted to notice old Shlomo.
 They all underestimated me, Rosa, but today, they will learn the error of their ways, for today, I will prove that nobody gets the best of Charles Boyle.
 I doused your beard in chloroform.
 Really?
 I find that very hard to beli [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC.]
 - Where's this goin'?
 - All the way to Trenton.
 Take your time.
 Aah, perfect.
 What?
 What happened?
 You know where the bracelet is?
 No.
 Kevin has arrived with proof that I am the only two-time winner of the heist.
 Here's your cummerbund, Raymond.
 We don't have time for this, sir!
 I'm gonna go search the first floor.
 And I will search the second floor.
 We are an inseparable team.
 That was a devious fib.
 I'm betraying her even as we speak.
 - Hey, Kev.
 - Diaz and I are covertly working together.
 She snuck up through the vents.
 This is a major reveal.
 I feel like you're not appreciating it.
 I don't like these heists, or what they bring out in you.
 - Oh, clam it, Kevin.
 - ""Clam it""?
 Cheddar, perhaps we should leave.
 No, Cheddar stays.
 He still has an important role to play.
 Give me Mr.
 Hootsworth.
 No one would ever think of looking for the bracelet in Cheddar's favorite chew toy.
 Or do you mean Jake's favorite chew toy?
 [CHUCKLES.]
 Well, thank God no one was around to hear that.
 Ah!
 There you are.
 I've been looking all over.
 Woah.
 That's a lot of yolks.
 Are you stress eating again or is this just a small Terry snack?
 I'm stress eating, Jake!
 My snack yolks are in that bowl.
 Oh.
 Well, stop eating eggs and come help me with the heist!
 - I'm not helping you.
 - Why not?
 Ugh, is this because I once betrayed you?
 Yes!
 It was our last interaction.
 And it was a huge mistake and I now realize that our friendship is way more important than any stupid banner.
 Look, the bracelet is in Cheddar's chew toy.
 I know because I bugged Holt's cummerbund.
 - You did?
 - Yes!
 I figured he would bring it in to show off.
 Now let's do this!
 - I don't know.
 - Look, Sarge, I'm sorry, okay?
 I can't undo the past, but come on.
 Would you rather win the heist with me or sit around swallowing eggs like Birdo from ""Super Mario 2""?
 Birdo doesn't eat eggs.
 Birdo spits them!
 Oh, my God, you got that reference, Terry?
 We're the perfect team!
 Come on, Sarge, please?
 - Fine, I'll help.
 - Ah!
 Wonderful.
 But, before you fully commit, I should probably give you the heads-up.
 My plan is very elaborate and you might get a little messy.
 I'm in.
 It's the heist, baby!
 Now let me know how we get that chew toy.
 All right!
 Okay.
 First, I infiltrate Holt's office and continue our argument about who won last year's heist.
 How many cummerbunds are you holding right now?
 Zero!
 It's one bund to none, son!
 - Tell him, Kevin.
 - I'm leaving.
 It doesn't matter As Holt argues with me I will be covertly releasing more water into Cheddar's bowl.
 Then we sit back and wait for - [CHEDDAR WHIMPERS.]
 - Potty time again?
 What if he takes him downstairs?
 He won't.
 I spent a lot of time making clandestine searches on Holt's computer.
 Now all of his targeted ads direct him straight to The Puppy PeePee Pad.
 Intriguing.
 He bought one and put it out on the roof next to Gina's golden statue.
 And, because he believes that Cheddar deserves to pee in privacy like any other self-respecting adult, he will leave Cheddar outside alone to do his business.
 Notify me when you're done, via bark.
 While Holt guards the door, you'll be swapping out Mr.
 Hootsworth for this.
 That all sounds great, but how do I get onto the roof without Holt noticing?
 Oh, Sarge.
 You'll already be out there In a perfect golden disguise.
 The plan worked!
 I got it!
 Oh my God, you look like an Oscar.
 Ooh!
 We should take a picture where it looks like I'm holding you.
 - Jake.
 - You're right.
 There's no time.
 - We'll do it later.
 - No, we won't!
 Help me get this paint off!
 Okay, put your hands out and I'll squirt you with a little makeup remover.
 Hi-ya!
 No!
 You're betraying me again?
 - Why?
 - Because of the banner!
 But I thought you said our friendship was more important!
 Yeah, that was obviously a lie.
 The banner was very expensive!
 I don't have a lot of money, Sarge.
 All right, bye.
 Don't make a lot of noise.
 Howdy.
 I just got back from lunch with Charles, who is not here.
 I am real glad I skipped the heist.
 Say, who is winning?
 I don't know, but I know that I am not winning.
 Interesting, it is also not me.
 Uh, why are you guys acting so weird?
 Gah, weird?
 Would a person who is acting weird laugh like this?
 A huh-huh huh-ha, carefree!
 - Yes.
 - Jake!
 Oh, Terry, you ripped yourself free.
 Yeah, maybe you should try cuffing me to a stronger metal next time.
 Yeah, I don't know the relative strength of metals.
 What's going on?
 Why does Terry look like an Oscar?
 - Doesn't he?
 - He has the bracelet!
 We grabbed Mr.
 Hootsworth from Cheddar and swapped it for a fake!
 Wow, Terry, my betrayals were all in good fun, but this really hurts.
 Cheddar, bring me Mr.
 Hootsworth.
 It's an updated model.
 The bowtie is Turkish blue instead of Egyptian blue.
 How could you not have noticed this?
 Because he's a dog.
 And at the end of the day a dog is no match for Jake Peralta.
 Well yours is a fake, too.
 Turkish blue bowtie.
 Oh, come on!
 The one time I say out loud I'm smarter than a dog?
 If I have a fake and you have a fake, who took the real bracelet?



 - I did.
 - Kevin?
 I swapped out Mr.
 Hootsworth for a fake while you were arguing with Peralta.
 How many cummerbunds are you holding right now?
 Zero!
 It's one bund to none, son!
 You betrayed me?
 But why?
 I can't have more of these trophies in our home.
 The cummerbund was already in the living room.
 What's next, a rusty medical bracelet suspended above our bed?
 Yes!
 Now hand it over.
 I don't have it.
 I gave it to Amy.
 - [GASPS.]
 - Santiago.
 - You betrayed me as well?
 - You betrayed me first.
 You were working with Rosa this whole time.
 That wasn't real.
 I was always gonna stab her in the back.
 You were?
 What kind of person treats another human being like that?
 You tricked me, Rosa!
 And then you shipped me to New Jersey!
 First of all, grow up.
 Second of all, how'd you - get back here so fast?
 - If you get a box wet enough, it's very easy to bust out of it.
 No one ask any follow-ups!
 I knew I couldn't trust you, Rosa.
 That's why I was going to double-cross you with Bill.
 That's right, he didn't really die.
 Hey, guys, you really thought I'd miss this year's heist?
 No way, I'm part of the squad.
 - No.
 - Not true.
 Okay, this is official getting hard to track.
 Who has the bracelet now?
 - Santiago.
 - Yeah!
 And no of you are getting it!
 We'll see about that.
 - [TASER CRACKLING.]
 - [GROANS.]
 What the hell?
 Remember that very fancy Swiss pen I got you for Christmas, the one that you keep in your pocket at all times?
 It's a taser, bro.
 - [BEEPING.]
 - Uuugh!
 I'll take that.
 Amy, do not make me tase you again.
 No, no, no, no, don't!
 I'm pregnant!
 - What?
 - I just found out.
 - It's a girl.
 - Oh, my God!
 Oh my God, it's happening!
 Quick, someone get a reaction video of me becoming an uncle!
 She's making it up.
 The pregnancy scam was my idea.
 No.
 No, no, no, no, Amy.
 Wait, is that true?
 Did you just lie to me about our baby?
 Yeah, did you lie to us about our baby?
 - You tased me!
 - You tased me first!
 Enough!
 Terry's had enough of this.
 This was supposed to be just a fun game but it's turned you all into terrible people.
 Betraying your husband, putting your friend in the mail.
 Jake and Amy, did you guys buy each other any gifts this year that weren't tasers?
 - No.
 - No.
 You all pretended that this was all about helping me with my test.
 But none of you cared one bit!
 You know what?
 You all suck!
 - [BEEPING.]
 - Oh no, my voice command.
 Terry, look out!
 [GROANS.]
 Okay.
 I know that was bad, but let's not jump to any conclusions about whose fault it was.
 ALL: Jacob Peralta, Jacob Peralta This was all his clever plan - ALL: Jacob Peralta - Wow, - ALL: Jacob Peralta - what a fun improvised song.
 ALL: This was all his clever plan His eyes aren't focusing and he hasn't referred to himself in the third person in minutes.
 He's clearly concussed.
 Guys, this is bad.
 The Lieutenant's exam is in 30 minutes.
 Okay, look, let's just get him to One Police Plaza and hopefully he'll wake up on the way.
 Charles, help me pick him up.
 Copy that.
 He's too heavy.
 We can't do this.
 God!
 How does he lift weights and also lift his arms?
 This is impossible.
 We'll never get him there.
 So you guys need help moving a body?
 Thank God old Bill's part of the squad.
 I mean, assuming, I am part of the squad.
 - Yes, sure.
 - Totally.
 Oh, yes, finally.
 I have somewhere to live.
 - What?
 - Meet me in the alley next to my shopping cart.
 It's the one with all the cans.
 Seems like his plan is just to put Terry in the shopping cart.
 Correct.
 We'll take it!
 [DRIVING MARIACHI MUSIC.]
 Room 410 is this way!
 Okay, we got him here with one minute to spare.
 Yes!
 I knew we could make it.
 All right, Sarge.
 You ready to go in there and ace this thing?
 Yeah, I can't believe it, I'm gonna be a pilot!
 Okay, well, that's not great.
 There's no way he can take the test in that condition!
 You're right.
 Amy, you're going to have to crawl inside his shirt and operate his arms for him.
 It's a Ratatouille situation.
 - On it.
 - No.
 It's over.
 We have to go in there and tell them that he won't be making it.
 So that's it then.
 Rosa, you should probably go in first since - this is mostly your fault.
 - Dude.
 All right, fine, I'll do it, jeez.
 Wait.
 Where is everyone?
 Where are all the desks?
 What is happening?
 What's happening is - You all suck!
 - [BEEPING.]
 ALL: You all are losers, you all are losers And Terry Jeffords is the best!
 You are all losers, you are all losers And Terry Jeffords is the best Son of a bitch stole my song.
 Wait, Terry has the bracelet?
 That's right.
 Me and my teammate Terry won.
 We fooled you all.
 - You didn't do [BLEEP.] !
 - Okay, well, neither did Jordan's teammates, but they still got rings.
 All right, fine.
 Just tell us how you did it.
 Well, first, for my plan to work, it had to happen on a day when I could control everything.
 I couldn't let it be Halloween.
 You faked the gas explosion!
 Yeah, stupid actors almost blew it.
 What was with that moaning, Trent?
 I thought you studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute!
 It doesn't mean anything.
 They just take your money!
 Oh, that is a huge relief.
 I felt so bad about poking that guy's wound to make sure it was real.
 You should still feel bad about that.
 No, it was all fake.
 I'm totally absolved.
 Continue with your story, Sarge.
 I knew you'd suggest a heist as a distraction from my Lieutenant exam, then all I had to do was sit back and watch as everyone took things way too far.
 But how'd you know we'd get so out of hand?
 I spent the last six months sowing the seeds of conflict.
 Man, I am so sick of Jake saying he is the only two-time Halloween heist winner.
 BOTH: I'm the only two-time Halloween heist winner.
 I can't believe everyone says you're not helpful during the Halloween heist.
 Just because they all think your fingers are too big.
 We'll show them.
 Thanks for inviting me over for dinner.
 Boy, that's hung in a real prominent place, isn't it?
 Not for long.
 I was manipulated?
 - Sorry, Kevin.
 - Don't apologize to him, Terry.
 It's his first heist.
 He needs to learn.
 Keep going.
 Well, after I got everyone acting like maniacs, all I had to do was make you feel bad by ""knocking myself out.
 "" The banner.
 But how did you learn my voice command?
 - I didn't have to.
 - I sold you the damn thing!
 No.
 I want it to unfurl when I say, ""You all suck.
 "" [THROUGH VOICE DISTORTION APP]
 Absolutely.
 Pleasure doing business with you.
 The pleasure was all mine.
 [CLICK.]
 That's gonna work.
 I spent $1,800 on that thing!
 - You did?
 - Amy, stop interrupting.
 Terry's doing his big speech.
 Anyway, once my fake concussion was on display, I created the perfect distraction for my partner to do his job.
 Cheddar, you duplicitous bitch.
 I've been training Cheddar for months.
 Wow, what a fun improvised song!
 When I swapped the Hootsworths, I put a magnetic collar on him!
 From there, Cheddar followed us all the way to One Police Plaza, where he hand-delivered the bracelet to me right outside this room.
 But, wait, what about the Lieutenant's exam?
 Aren't you supposed to be taking it right now?
 Hell no, I took that thing weeks ago.
 And I passed!
 I'm already a lieutenant!
 - You are?
 - That's incredible!
 - Lieutenant Jeffords!
 - This is amazing.
 I'm so proud of you, Terry.
 All right.
 You've overstepped now, Bill.
 Yeah, it's weird you're here, Bill.
 To Terry Jeffords, the ultimate human being slash genius.
 Nice work Lieutenant.
 - ALL: Yeah!
 - Thanks, squad!
 Also the next heist will be at Halloween, so you'll only be champion for six months.
 - This is half a win at best.
 - Sounds about right, yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Pretty garbage.
 Hey, Scully, so you and Earl made up?
 Yup.
 Hitchcock helped us realize we shouldn't fight just because we're so different.
 - Yeah.
 To our differences!
 - [MUGS CLINK.]
 TOGETHER: Oh, dang it!
 [SIMULTANEOUS FARTS.]
 TOGETHER: Ooh, double dang it.
 - What?
 - Oh, my God.
 Terry, what you did today was awesome and I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I took things too far.
 Are you kidding me?
 I was just guilting you as a tactic.
 I love how crazy the heist gets.
 Okay, good, 'cause what I really wanted to say is next heist I'm gonna drown you in your own blood.
 Oh, yeah?
 Well, then I'm gonna rip your arms off - and beat you to death with 'em.
 - Oh!
 I'm going to slice your Achilles' tendons, peel off your fingernails, and stick knitting needles in your eyes.
 BOTH: Oh, damn.
 Raymond, you were right.
 These heists are fun.
 Fremulon.
 Not a doctor.
 Shh.

Guys!
 I have a great idea for a prank.
 Before Holt comes in, I'm gonna put ink on the podium where he puts his hands.
 I don't think he'll fall for that.
 - I did!
 - How?
 I haven't even opened this yet.
 I guess it's unrelated.
 Captain Holt hates pranks.
 This is gonna backfire, man.
 Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down.
 I'll move his podium a foot to the left.
 What?
 He'll be so angry.
 - Okay, five inches.
 - Five?
 - Three?
 - Three?
 - One?
 - One?
 All right.
 I'll move it a half inch.
 Fine.
 It's your funeral.
 Oh my god.
 Worst prank ever.
 So stupid.
 Holt's not even going to notice.
 Good morning.
 You guys the podium, it's Ha.
 [chuckles.]
 [laughter intensifies.]
 [riotous laughter.]
 [shouting.]
 You're crazy!
 How did you pull this off?
 [upbeat music.]
 Yes, Kevin, they moved it a full half inch.
 I'll tell you the entire story tonight.
 I love you as well.
 Goodbye.
 Oh, that was a fun several moments.
 So, there's been a series of homicides.
 Three victims, all young men, each murdered in their own fashion.
 A serial killer?
 How'd they do it?
 Strangled?
 Mangled?
 Hung, i. e. dangled?
 Their bodies were disfigured.
 I. e.
 ""mangled. "" Continue.
 Our killer cut the victims open and ripped out their hearts.
 Now, before I assign this case - Five dollars!
 - What?
 I'm bidding for it.
 I want this so badly.
 - That's not how we - $20.
 Just to make this interesting.
 - $100 for Jake to have it!
 - I was going to assign the case to you and Peralta but perhaps I should - give it to Diaz instead.
 - $200!
 It's not about the money, Boyle!
 Commissioner Kelly is breathing down my neck.
 I need this case handled professionally and maturely.
 Name one time I haven't acted professionally.
 You're holding a juice box.
 It stops me from spilling my juice!
 Look, we can handle this, sir.
 Do we joke around sometimes?
 Yes, but when it's time to buckle down, we're seasoned professionals.
 That's why they call us the Spice Boys.
 They don't and they won't.
 Sir, I swear, give us a chance.
 We can get this guy.
 Fine.
 Case goes to the Spice Boys.
 - Please don't call us that.
 - Too late.
 Spice Boy train has left the station.
 Toot toot!
 Hey, hey, check it out.
 It's my lieutenant start paperwork!
 It's gonna be so weird not calling you Sarge anymore.
 Maybe I'll go by Loot.
 ""Morning, Loot!"" ""Loot over here.
 "" ""Let's invite Loot!"" What do you think?
 I bet you're excited about the raise that comes with your promotion.
 Well, Terry doesn't like to talk about money, but, uh Cha-ching!
 [laughs.]
 Now I can pay for Showtime.
 Find out who or what ""SMILF"" is!
 You know, some people say, ""Mo money, mo problems,"" but those people are idiots.
 Money's amazing.
 Wait, what?
 This says there's not enough money in the Nine-Nine's budget for my raise!
 What does that mean?
 They're going to transfer me!
 Now, I know what you're thinking.
 [dumb voice.]
 Where'd Dem guts go?
 Uh, yeah.
 This guy needs a dentist, because he's got a big ol' cavity.
 [laughs.]
 I love that.
 I'm stealing it.
 You cannot steal what is a gift.
 Thank you.
 Okay, so whoever did this, they weren't careful with the organs.
 They just sorta grabbed whatever and yanked.
 Title of your s*x tape.
 Oh, that's just something we say back at the Nine-Nine.
 Interesting, 'cause around here s*x tape is what we call the adhesive you use to reattach a severed pen1s.
 Oh, I'll have to pick some of that up.
 - Why?
 - Anyway most of the killer's incisions are very sloppy but then once he gets to the heart they become very careful.
 I mean, look at the vena cava.
 That's a clean cut.
 Game recognize game.
 Hmm.
 I like your style, Doctor Cox.
 Gentlemen!
 The Commissioner would like a status update on the case.
 Oh, come on Ray.
 You make it sound like I'm puttin' the screws to ya.
 No, I just popped in to say if you don't solve these murders immediately there's gonna be some serious consequences.
 [laughs.]
 I'm just messin' with ya!
 Listen, you know what would help you catch this guy?
 I just launched a new app, HotClues.
 Are you familiar with it?
 The one that allows civilians to submit anonymous tips directly to the NYPD?
 Yes, I'm familiar with HotClues.
 Great!
 You know, it's actually helped us solve 17 cases, so I think we should ask for the public's help with this one.
 No, study after study has shown that soliciting anonymous tips results in false leads and wrongful convictions.
 Hmm.
 Tell me how you really feel.
 - I did.
 - And I loved it!
 Such passion!
 But I think HotClues could help us here.
 No, we will solve this case the proper way with actual police work conducted by the two best - detectives in the NYPD.
 - Captain!
 Well, I certainly hope your methods work.
 For the sake of your careers.
 [cheerfully.]
 Bye now.
 Oof!
 Now that guy's gonna need some s*x tape.
 [in unison.]
 'Cause someone's gonna cut his pen1s off.
 We are vibing!
 So I found out where they're transferring me.
 And, you know, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
 Oh!
 Somewhere nice?
 Upper West Side?
 No, even better.
 Staten Island!
 [bursts out laughing.]
 Good one, Loot.
 - Where you really going?
 - No, I'm serious.
 Staten!
 Wait, they're transferring you out of New York?
 It's part of the City!
 - Is it, though?
 - Hey, Staten Island is great.
 It's got parks, loads of bike paths, tons of up and coming restaurants I mean easy access to New Jersey!
 You're lying.
 Your right pec is popping all over the place.
 We all know that's your tell.
 Of course I'm lying!
 It's Staten Island!
 The precinct is the One-Two-Two.
 How the hell am I supposed to chant One-Two-Two?
 One-Two-Two!
 One-Two-Two!
 I sound like a damn choo-choo train!
 Detectives, how's the case?
 Any breakthroughs?
 Uh, well, we're still in the early stages.
 Do you have a suspect or DNA evidence?
 Oh my god.
 I wish.
 Look, we need to solve this to prove to that idiot John Kelly, how inane and useless his little app is.
 Oh dip.
 I see what's going on.
 - Holt is feeling petty.
 - I'm not being petty.
 I can assure you my feelings about John Kelly are purely professional.
 Are they?
 Because every time his name is brought up in our group text thread you immediately send back a super catty GIF of some lady from ""The Durrells in Corfu"" rolling her eyes.
 That's Louisa Durrell, exasperated by the pace of life on Corfu!
 Wait, the group text thread is back?
 - No.
 - We misspoke.
 - Yeah.
 - Look, if you can't solve this case, I'll reassign it to someone who can.
 Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
 I have an idea.
 We need to get into the mind of a sicko.
 And the only way to do that is with the help of another sicko.
 [intense music.]
 Jake!
 It's so good to see you!
 Come give me a hug, I'm not going to eat you!
 Also, don't hug me 'cause I will try to eat you.
 This is such a surprise!
 I haven't seen you since I transferred here!
 - How's Amy?
 - She's great!
 We're married and she's a Sergeant now.
 - Wow!
 - Yeah!
 How's everything here?
 You know, same old same old.
 - Guess who's here?
 Herman.
 - Herman!
 Always playing Yahtzee, knew everybody's name.
 - Worshipped Satan.
 - Did he?
 He never mentioned that.
 [laughter.]
 - He wouldn't shut up about it.
 - It is exhausting.
 Well, I'm Charles.
 I'm Jake's best friend.
 Charles, he's serving three life sentences.
 No need to flex.
 So Caleb, we're tracking a serial killer and I was thinking you could help us get inside his head.
 Just because I ate humans doesn't mean that I'm inhuman, Jake.
 Caleb, come on.
 That's not what I meant.
 I'm just kidding.
 I'm probably friends with the guy online.
 [chuckles.]
 What's his deal?
 Well, he's been murdering young men and cutting out their hearts.
 Ew.
 What?
 I would never eat a heart.
 I stick to the normal stuff.
 Butts and thighs.
 One time I ate a foot, but it was nasty.
 - Yeah, I can see that.
 - You know what?
 There was some weird guy on the forum recently.
 - The forum?
 - Yeah, it's a chat room for people who like to talk about eating human beings but definitely won't act on it.
 Wink.
 Yeah, it's hosted on - [together.]
 Reddit.
 - Obviously.
 Anyways, he showed up from out of nowhere asking questions - about cutting out hearts.
 - Really?
 Do you know anything else about him?
 I'd never seen him on there before but you could check the logs.
 I'll approve you.
 - I'm an admin.
 - Ah.
 Oh, you might want to switch to incognito mode.
 Otherwise your targeted ads will be pretty cannibal-specific.
 Ah, good to know.
 Well, it was good to see you, Caleb.
 Send me that info.
 [all screaming.]
 Hey Terry, you okay?
 You skipped all your lunches.
 I'm going through the budget to see if there's any way we could save enough money for me to stay here.
 - You find anything yet?
 - Yeah, we could switch to generic printer ink, cut down on custodial services, and stop buying office birthday cakes.
 - Over my dead body!
 - It's just an idea.
 - Well, take it off the table!
 - Damn, Scully, fine.
 We could stop paying for an exterminator.
 It's pointless.
 We all have guns.
 Who am I kidding?
 We'll never save enough to keep me at the Nine-Nine.
 You're right.
 The only way to free up that money is if you fire someone.
 What?
 I can't just fire someone without cause.
 Come on.
 We all know there's a bunch of dead weight around here.
 Sloppy paperwork, penmanship fails, phone etiquette that makes me want to barf.
 Let's axe a dud!
 Damn, Amy.
 I am loving this shade on you.
 But Loot's right.
 We can't just fire somebody.
 That said, you could ""inspire"" somebody to quit.
 For example, Broadway Brian.
 Yes!
 Broadway Brian, of course!
 Who the hell is Broadway Brian?
 Brian in records.
 He's always talking about what a great singer he is and how his dream is to be in musicals.
 You just need to convince him to go for his dream.
 Oh, I don't know.
 That feels underhanded.
 It's never underhanded to help somebody follow their dream.
 Yesterday, I was watching ""Ellen,"" and she had this woman on who wanted to be a chef, but she didn't have any taste buds, so she quit her job, hired her best friend to be her taste tester.
 And now they have the best taco truck in Lansing.
 It was inspiration as [bleep.]
 .
 Yeah.
 I'd just be helping him follow his dream!
 I'd be doing him a favor!
 I'm going to inspire Brian's ass right out of this office!
 For him, not me.
 Dreams, and whatnot, you know.
 Detectives, Commissioner Kelly is back and he found his way here on his own without any tips from the public.
 - How impressive is that?
 - Well, thank you, Raymond.
 I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
 Thought I'd check on your progress.
 - [phone chimes.]
 - Um, we have a solid lead.
 Suspicious online behavior from someone using the name Jamburger77.
 There's only one person in the tri-state area with that surname Eileen Jamburger.
 101 years old, and immediately racist on the phone.
 She is not a suspect at this time.
 But the user did make one non-cannibal post.
 A negative review of the headroom in a 2006 Saturn Ion.
 Real creep car.
 So, we pulled records on every 2006 Ion in the city and we're following up on them now.
 Well, I'll be.
 That's some nice police work, Peralta.
 - And Charles.
 - I especially like how you found evidence, followed up on it, and it's lead you closer to a solve.
 No, I agree, Peralta.
 It's excellent work.
 You must've hated saying that.
 No, I didn't.
 I like giving compliments.
 You have a nice deep voice.
 It is very commanding.
 Cut the crap, John.
 You're furious!
 And everyone can tell!
 See?
 Very commanding.
 So, I know Raymond has some issues with HotClues, but we did put the call out on the app and got a very promising tip.
 Look, we're not going against our Captain.
 So this guy says he saw someone covered in blood getting out of a Saturn Ion.
 But you don't need that tip because you are among the best detectives in the NYPD!
 [laughter.]
 You're right, we don't need that tip!
 But seriously, send us that tip.
 We need it.
 Hey, Brian!
 What are you up to?
 Typing in numbers into a computer.
 Like I always do endlessly for 40-60 hours a week.
 Well, when you love what you do, you don't work a day in your life!
 Unless, do you not love sad data entry?
 Well, my passion is performing.
 I do musical theater.
 - It's the hardest form of acting.
 - I agree!
 I am always saying, if you're not singing, - you're not acting.
 - Right!
 It's probably hard to audition because you're always here, right?
 Yes!
 I had to pass up a chance to read for ""Seussical.
 "" You know Brian, this makes me think of something I saw on ""Ellen.
 "" There was this lady, she wanted to be a cook, but her tongue was all messed up, and she had this friend who didn't even have a tongue I mean, she did, and now they own a taco truck in Lansing!
 Huh?
 Follow your dreams, man!
 You gotta follow your dreams.
 Find your taco truck!
 Wow.
 Thank you.
 That gives me a lot to think about.
 So what did you come down here for?
 Oh, uh, I had to borrow the water cooler!
 [grunting.]
 All right.
 Thanks, Brian.
 Think about what I said.
 So, the tipster saw the Saturn parked out back and the woman at the desk said it belongs to the man in room 203.
 - One ""Larry Bird.
 "" - Obvious fake name.
 Or is it so insane that there's no way it's fake?
 If you're trying not to draw attention, why not go with something like ""John Smith?"" From ""Pocahontas""?
 Uh, yeah.
 Way to fly under the radar.
 [laughs.]
 Excuse me, is there ice yet?
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I don't work here.
 I'm a police officer.
 Well, then I'd like to lodge a formal complaint.
 There hasn't been ice here for days and everyone knows my wine coolers are supposed - to be served chilled.
 - You're an adult.
 Why are you drinking wine coolers?
 - Because I'm on vacation.
 - Okay.
 Well, I'll mention the ice.
 Thanks.
 Pig.
 Okay.
 [phone ringing.]
 Oh, it's Holt.
 I didn't tell him what we were doing.
 I'll act natural.
 You're not gonna be on the phone call.
 Just do nothing.
 Hey, Captain!
 What delicious water I'm drinking!
 [growls.]
 Sorry that we didn't check in before we left.
 We're just down at the DMV following up - on the Saturn owners.
 - Lies!
 Captain!
 How'd you know we were here?
 I followed you!
 John Kelly gave you a ""Hot Clue,"" didn't he?
 How dare you disobey me.
 Come on, sir, it was a good tip and we're trying to catch a serial killer.
 Well then let's see this tip, this groundbreaking tip that threatens to blow the case wide open.
 Okay, I know this tone.
 Here comes petty Holt.
 Naw, bitch.
 I'm not being petty.
 You just said, ""naw, bitch.
 "" - Show me the tip.
 - [exasperated sigh.]
 [whispers.]
 Title of your s*x tape.
 I was behind the Royal Motor Inn.
 I saw a guy get out of a blue Saturn Ion and he was covered in blood.
 Anyway, Baba Booey!
 Baba Booey?
 Is that a clue?
 Uh, I don't know what Baba Booey means, actually.
 It's a popular prank phrase from Howard Stern.
 - Charles!
 - Oh, from a shock jock.



 Well, that changes everything.
 Now we have a credible break in the case.
 Baba Booey!
 [hard knocking.]
 NYPD, open up!
 Uh, just a minute!
 Ooh, I bet he's frantically packing up his collection of hearts.
 [glass breaking.]
 Goin' in!
 Get back.
 - There's blood everywhere!
 - He went out the window.
 I'll go around back.
 Fine, Kelly found the murderer's kill room.
 Whoop-Dee-doo!
 Should we throw him a parade?
 Yeah!
 Maybe!
 Patrols have searched a five-block radius.
 No sign of the perp.
 And there were no prints.
 He was wearing gloves.
 - Like the inimitable Audrey Hepburn.
 - Nope.
 Gentlemen, there's something I need to say.
 I gave you such a hard time about using Commissioner Kelly's app because I was being petty.
 I wanted him to fail and I took it out on you and for that I am very Oh.
 You kind of trailed off there, sir.
 Were you going to finish your sentence?
 It felt like you were going to say you were sorry.
 I did.
 Boyle heard it.
 Uh, I would remember if someone said my catch phrase.
 Fine, I'm sorry.
 I'm very sorry.
 Apology accepted.
 - I am so proud of you.
 - Peralta.
 You're right.
 I'll rub it in later.
 What matters now is solving this case.
 Now, our murderer may have gotten away, but we did find his kill room.
 Maybe there's something in here that we're not seeing, yet.
 Perhaps we should pay your cannibal friend another visit.
 I wouldn't say they're friends so much as ex-cellmates.
 No, it's true.
 We're friends.
 - He ate kids!
 - Well, people are complicated.
 Now, I'll tell you one thing.
 You are not looking for a cannibal.
 - Why do you say that?
 - With all that blood?
 No self-respecting cannibal would waste all that sauce.
 See, Charles?
 He's a foodie, like you.
 - Who are you?
 - Can I see that picture again?
 Oh man, those are some nice tools.
 I would love to spread some ribs using that sternum retractor, but they only sell those to hospitals.
 Wait a minute.
 What did you just say?
 I said I'd love to get my little fingies in some chesties.
 No, no, no.
 Not the super gross part.
 Surgery-grade tools, precise incisions around the heart, and there was no ice at the motel.
 Because the perp was using it for the hearts.
 We're not looking for a serial killer.
 He stole the hearts for a transplant!
 Boom!
 We solved it.
 - Boyle, give me a hug.
 - Yeah!
 - [all screaming.]
 - No!
 Hey, I did it!
 I talked to Brian and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.
 Really?
 Is he gonna quit?
 I don't know, that was the first step.
 But I figure if I talk to him twice a day - for the next few weeks - Attention, everyone!
 Today will be my final day at the Nine-Nine.
 Damn, Loot.
 That was fast.
 I will be taking my talents to Broadway and I owe it all to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.
 All I did was believe in you.
 And it changed everything.
 So Lieutenant, this one's for you.
 Oh.
 [off-key.]
 Another opening Another show - Uh oh.
 - From Philly, Boston To Baltimore Amy, you said he could sing.
 I didn't say he could sing.
 He said he could sing.
 Dance break!
 What have I done?
 - Bye, Jake!
 - Here it is.
 The federal heart transplant waiting list.
 Check out who's all the way down at 2,319.
 Angelo Rinaldi, who runs the Rinaldi crime family.
 Well.
 Then let's pay him a visit.
 [bangs.]
 - NYPD!
 - Hands where we can see them!
 There's a heart in the cooler.
 Sorry, Rinaldi, the only transplant happening today is your ass to jail.
 He is definitely unconscious and didn't hear any of that.
 But I'm still pumped.
 Case closed.
 Let's go!
 So Rinaldi had his trigger-man stealing hearts so he could have a transplant.
 That is fun!
 Good job, Ray.
 Thank you, Commissioner Kelly.
 We couldn't have done it without your Sir, you're doing the trailing off thing again.
 Help.
 Um and I owe you an apology.
 I'm sorry and I must admit, you've really got something on your hands with this HotClues app.
 Well, that is so nice of you to say.
 But, if you like the app now, wait until you see the updates we're rolling out.
 Now you can Auto-Tune your tips.
 Show 'em, Micah.
 [Auto-Tuned voice.]
 There's a mysterious package On the corner of Fourth and Park - 4th and Park - Huh?
 Sounds [imitating Auto-Tune.]
 Pretty nifty.
 No You a Stern fan, Micah?
 Oh yeah.
 Listen every day.
 Baba Booey!
 - Baba Booey?
 - Baba Booey.
 Baba Booey.
 You're the guy from the video.
 You called in the tip.
 [uncomfortable laughter.]
 Yeah.
 Ah, Micah, do me a favor.
 Give us a moment here, all right?
 Nobody in or out.
 Lock the doors.
 Thanks, bud.
 Actually Micah, you wanna leave that door unlocked in case we want to make a quick getaway?
 I'm gonna do what he told me to do.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 Thanks, bud.
 What's going on, Kelly?
 Why is your assistant submitting tips?
 Because they already had the information.
 The tips aren't coming from the public at all.
 Oh, cool theory.
 But if I already had the information, why am I pouring so much money into developing this app?
 To hide where you're getting it.
 Because you're using illegal wiretaps or something!
 You got me!
 [laughs.]
 You guys are good!
 I just love how you ping pong off each other.
 This is blatantly unconstitutional.
 - I'm going to the press!
 - Yes, you should.
 But first, do you know what a stingray is?
 Of course we know what a Stingray is.
 Tenderest meat in the ocean!
 No, stingray is a portable cell tower.
 You drive it around the city.
 It captures data from any cell phone within reach.
 Like, oh, text messages, location history, voicemail Oh my god.
 You have a ""Dark Knight"" machine!
 Yes, I do, and the three of you are not going to say a word about it because the 18 felons we captured through the system, they'd go free.
 That's unfortunate, but it's better than living in a police state.
 - I'm not sitting on this.
 - Okay.
 But I can assure you, you can't prove this program exists.
 It's just your word against mine.
 - I'm more than fine with that.
 - You shouldn't be.
 Because I can prove you'd do anything to sabotage me.
 My stingray captured your texts, too.
 No, he has the ""Durrells in Corfu"" GIF!
 Oh-ho-ho.
 Way worse.
 You wrote several people, ""I would do anything to rid the NYPD of John Kelly.
 ""Sincerely, Raymond Holt.
 "" You have got to stop signing your text messages!
 What do I do?
 Brian sounds terrible.
 I can't let him quit his job!
 He'll never get cast in anything.
 Maybe he'll be one of those people on ""The Voice"" that's so bad they become an Internet sensation.
 That's not what they do on ""The Voice"", Amy, that's ""American Idol""!
 ""The Voice"" is purely a celebration of talent.
 If he wants to pursue his dream and it doesn't work out, that's not on you.
 He made his choice.
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.
 You know, no blood on my hands.
 I just need to let him do his thing.
 - Terry - Hey, Brian!
 So, what did you think of my song?
 - I loved how loud it was.
 - Thank you.
 I wouldn't have had the courage to do it without you.
 Sure, I daydream about it all the time, but being a single dad, I always chickened out.
 You have a kid?
 I have kids.
 Three under three.
 Oh, fun!
 Hey, unrelated.
 Uh, what's your financial situation like?
 Do you have savings to fall back on?
 Do you come from wealth, or?
 - [chuckles.]
 - No, no, but [off-key.]
 That's not gonna stop my dreams Sick pipes, Bri.
 - Good luck out there.
 - Thanks.
 No!
 I can't let you do this.
 What?
 You're a bad singer, man.
 I don't want to be mean, but if you try to make a living at this, you will die on the street.
 Oh.
 Thanks for telling me.
 - So that's it, then.
 - Yup.
 Next week is my last week at the Nine-Nine.
 Attention, everyone!
 I will be giving up singing.
 This will be my final performance.
 [loud and off-key.]
 One pound two ounces Not now, Brian!
 - [sigh of relief.]
 - Sir, there you are.
 We've been looking everywhere for.
 Kevin says he hasn't heard from you all night.
 Yes, I've been sitting in my office wallowing in my hopelessness, and eating the saddest food known to mankind.
 Ice cream.
 Oh my god, he's Bridget Jones-ing.
 Okay, well it's time to put that aside and pull out whatever food you eat when you're happy.
 - Dry beans?
 - Sure!
 Look.
 We can still stop John Kelly.
 All we need is some hard evidence.
 How?
 He won't let us anywhere near him or One Police Plaza.
 I know, which is why I've assembled a team of powerful allies in the NYPD.
 No, that's too risky.
 How do you know they're not loyal to John Kelly?
 Because these people aren't loyal to anybody.
 [Disturbed's ""Down With The Sickness"".]
 Ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah I made a suicide squad!

"
06x18 - Suicide Squad
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=33679,"





Gentlemen, may I present to you the Suicide Squad.
 Hang on there, genius.
 You want us, your enemies, to help you bring down Commissioner Kelly?
 You guys consider me your enemy?
 You're some of my best friends.
 We haven't talked to you in, like, three years, C. J.
 Wait, yeah.
 I'm thinking of different guys.
 Oh, Raymond, that you came to me to ask for help shows how much you've matured.
 You know what else shows how much you've matured?
 Your withered face.
 Now I know why you refer to this as a Suicide Squad, Peralta, because I already want to kill myself.
 Why don't you wait a week?
 You'll probably die of old age.
 The only way I'm going to die is if you touch me with one of your bony fingers and drag me across the River Styx, you reaper.
 Ah, wonderful.
 Very creative.
 Look, John Kelly has to be stopped.
 He's spying on civilians.
 It's unconstitutional and it's wrong.
 Please.
 Do you think any one of these jackals cares about what's right or wrong?
 - I'll help.
 - See, sir?
 There is good in every person.
 But I want it to be known it's for selfish reasons.
 Why would you want that to be known?
 'Cause I've never met C. J.
 before and I want him to think that I'm cool.
 It's working.
 I mean, I love how you're taking over the room.
 Like that?
 Yeah, it's awesome.
 You know, I actually wouldn't mind getting rid of John Kelly either.
 That guy makes up so many dumb rules.
 He told me I couldn't eat raw chicken.
 And you think a new commissioner will Yeah, he's already on board, so yes, a new commissioner would let you eat raw chicken for whatever reason.
 - It's healthier.
 - It sure is, Ceej.
 And what do you hope to get out of this, Madeline?
 Let me guess Revenge on Dorothy for killing your sister?
 I want the same as you, Raymond I think what John Kelly is doing is terrible.
 Yes, well said, Wuntch.
 So, we're all on board.
 This is exciting!
 Let's bring it in, huh?
 ""Suicide Squad"" on three.
 Ready?
 One, two I don't touch other dudes' hands.
 - Whose hand is sticky?
 - It might be me.
 - I ate a popsicle earlier.
 - It's probably Madeline.
 Cockroaches release a mucus-like secretion.
 You would know about roaches, you roach.
 And three!
 Suicide Squad!
 Sorry.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Why is Santiago here?
 We agreed to keep this secret.
 Well, it's hard to keep secrets when you're married to an ace detective.
 He told me as soon as he got home.
 I did.
 I'm so excited about the Suicide Squad.
 Oh, I love seeing these glimpses of domestic Peraltiago.
 - Now kiss.
 - No.
 - You don't do it enough.
 - We do it all the time, - just not in front of you.
 - It's been a year!
 We don't have time for this.
 Now, Kelly's stingrays can steal cell phone data from anyone, including us, so I procured special equipment for us to communicate with.
 Extremely old beepers?
 Yeah, they're analog, so the stingrays can't detect them.
 I had one of these in high school, and it was so cool.
 You're just sitting in math class, and you feel that buzz, and it's your dad saying he loves you.
 The rest of the day, you're just walking on air.
 Did you guys just kiss?
 - Hm?
 - Did I miss it?
 Yes.
 It was very unprofessional.
 - Oh, come on!
 - I don't like this.
 I wouldn't wish working with Madeline Wuntch on my worst enemy, and my worst enemy is Madeline Wuntch, whom I hate.
 Look, if you wanna stop Kelly, she's the key to my entire plan.
 So, either you get over it, or we walk away from this thing right now.
 Ugh, fine.
 I will learn to trust Madeline Wuntch.
 I will never trust Madeline Wuntch.
 She's a venomous snake waiting to strike, and you know what we do to snakes.
 Chop their heads off.
 Remove the skin.
 - Turn them into boots.
 - Don't be absurd.
 Who would want Trollskin boots?
 You just said she was a snake.
 The devil comes in many forms.
 No, what I meant was I want you to follow her and make sure she doesn't betray us.
 And, uh, don't tell Peralta.
 Count me in.
 I got nothing else going on.
 Aren't you supposed to be getting ready to transfer to Staten Island?
 - Eh, that's not real.
 - It was pretty real last week.
 That's before I decided to pretend it wasn't.
 - I'm in denial.
 - Most people who are in denial don't usually say they're in denial.
 That's because they're in denial about being in denial.
 But I'm not in denial.
 I'm in denial.
 Is Jeffords' brain okay for this mission?
 Yes, sir for this and all future Nine-Nine missions, which I'll definitely be a part of.
 But let's go.
 So, this apartment will be our base for the duration of the mission.
 Thank you to The Vulture for procuring it.
 Hey, don't thank me.
 Thank my boy, Billy.
 He said the place was mine while he's still in prison.
 That's not what it sounds like.
 His only crime was planning a kickass music festival.
 Are you friends with the Fyre Festival guy?
 Best friends.
 He got a bum rap.
 You can learn about it when my documentary comes out.
 It points all the blame where it clearly belongs with the island people.
 Wow, so many levels of terrible there.
 All right, we need to catch Kelly in the act of illegally spying, so here's the plan.
 We commit a fake crime so serious that he's forced to deploy the stingray.
 - What kind of crime?
 - We're gonna kidnap a cop.
 But not just any cop it needs to be someone so high-ranking that it sends shockwaves through the system, but not important enough that their absence negatively impacts the NYPD in any way.
 Who you guys thinking?
 We're clearly all looking at you.
 Oh, God.
 Am I in charge of the meeting?
 Dismissed.
 Dismissed.
 No.
 You're getting kidnapped, C. J.
 Amy, Charles, and I will be the kidnappers.
 Captain Holt is the driver.
 Here's how it'll go down.
 - Approaching the target.
 - All right, let's do this.
 Masks on.
 Actually, scratch that.
 We're not gonna use ski masks.
 We'll use cool rubber masks.
 Ooh, we should be the ladies of ""The First Wives Club.
 "" I call Keaton.
 We're not gonna do ""First Wives Club"" masks.
 Just because you can't be Keaton?
 - Grow up, Jake!
 - No, because they don't exist.
 And also, yeah, Keaton is clearly the coolest one and I don't think it's really fair that you just ""called her.
 "" Forget it.
 We'll wear scary gorilla masks.
 - Approaching the target.
 - Okay, let's do this.
 Masks on.
 When C.
 J.
 goes to get his morning coffee, we will arrive and grab him.
 He will pretend to struggle just enough to attract attention.
 Help!
 Help!
 I'm gonna write this down so I remember my lines.
 I can see that you already have the word ""milk"" written on your hand.
 I know where this is going.
 Milk!
 Milk!
 - Don't do that.
 - Too risky.
 What if you leave DNA evidence at the scene?
 Well, luckily, it's a missing person's case, so the lead detective will be The Vulture.
 He will arrive and No, no, no, no, no.
 Hold on, Peralta.
 You forgot to say that I ride in on my motorcycle.
 Okay, The Vulture who rode in on his motorcycle Kobe.
 Will take charge and eliminate any evidence we left behind.
 - There's nothing here.
 - Make sure the other people working with you are your worst detectives.
 I got just the guys for you.
 I mean, they're real duds.
 I wouldn't even trust those two to get coffee for me.
 Gerard, tell him where we're at.
 Brooklyn.
 You know, you guys take off, all right?
 I got this.
 - All right.
 - Hey, you.
 Come here.
 You wanna tell me what you saw?
 I'll tell you what I'd like to see.
 - Your big - Stop.
 I'm the one describing the plan.
 What, so there's not gonna be any s*x at all?
 No.
 The point is, without any good leads, Kelly will give the order to use the stingray an order that we will record thanks to our very own Madeline Wuntch.
 Not possible.
 Kelly won't tell me anything.
 - He won't even meet with me.
 - Perhaps you can sneak in disguised as an old leather chair.
 Will you calm down?
 She works at One Police Plaza.
 All you have to do is ""run into him.
 "" Commissioner Kelly.
 Oh, Madeline.
 I didn't see you there.
 I thought you were an old leather chair.
 - He's not gonna say that.
 - He might.
 You're worse than The Vulture.
 Anyways, give him a handshake, a pat on the back I heard your app caught a serial killer.
 HotClues strikes again.
 - Yes, indeedy.
 - And plant the bug.
 And that's the plan.
 That is exactly how tomorrow's gonna go.
 Got it.
 So you do or you don't want me to yell ""milk""?
 - Approaching the target.
 - Okay, let's do this.
 Masks on.
 I thought we were getting rubber masks.
 Yeah, I couldn't find any.
 It's not Halloween.
 These look like they're from ""Fifty Shades of Grey.
 "" Yeah, I got them from a s*x shop, Amy, and we're lucky to have them.
 There were only three left.
 At least you're not wearing a gimp mask.
 Look, there weren't a lot of options.
 It was a very awkward retail interaction.
 Can we please just kidnap C. J.
 now?
 Leave me alone!
 - Leave me alone!
 - What the [bleep.] ?
 You'll never get me alive!
 Help!
 Help!
 Somebody call the police!
 Here, take her.
 Take her instead of me.
 No, don't hurt me.
 Don't hurt me.
 - Oh, it's you.
 - Yeah, it's us.
 Now, get in the van.
 Oh, okay.
 Help!
 Hey, could we stop and get a Slushee?
 It's just that you guys kinda made me drop it back there.
 - What the hell was that, C. J. ?
 - I'm sorry!
 I didn't know it was you.
 You were supposed to be in gorilla masks.
 Okay, so, let me get this straight.
 You thought that we were real kidnappers who showed up at the exact time that we planned a fake kidnapping?
 Exactly.
 You get it.
 He gets it.
 Nobody is following us.
 I'm headed back to the apartment.
 Okay, look, that didn't go great, but we got away, and on the plus side, no more of the plan hinges on C. J.
 Oh, thank God.
 He pulled off your mask, Jake.
 What if someone saw you?
 That's why we have The Vulture.
 - Kobe.
 - Ow.
 Captain Pembroke, what do you have there?
 - Did you find a hair?
 - Nice work.
 Let's bag it.
 Let's get it to the lab.
 They have my hair?
 I thought you put your two worst guys on this.
 These are my worst guys, all right?
 They're real dorks.
 They both wear glasses.
 - One of them's even a woman.
 - Ugh.
 You said you didn't trust them to get coffee.
 Look, if you can't tell what ""coffee"" is code for by now, then you and I shouldn't be talking about this, Jake.
 Oh, my God.
 He put his best detectives on the case.
 Hey, my two best detectives are Sticky and Boner, and they definitely know how to order ""coffee. "" Extra cream.
 Wink, wink.
 Guys, stop fighting.
 We did it.
 Let's just chill and play some ""Madden.
 "" No one's playing ""Madden"" with you, C. J.
 You know what, Peralta?
 This is all your fault.
 A witness saw your face and now there's a police sketch of you being sent around.
 Oh, please.
 That doesn't even look like me.
 The only thing that got right is my little curl, and I can just get rid of that.
 - Jake, you can't.
 - You're right.
 - It's worth the risk to keep it.
 - This is bad.
 - Our plan is collapsing.
 - No, it's not.
 John Kelly's gonna authorize the stingray within the hour and everything'll be fine assuming Wuntch gets the bug in place.
 - She's still standing there.
 - Oh, since we got time, you wanna talk about your good-bye party?
 Will you eat a cake, or does it have to be - boneless chicken breast?
 - Sure.
 70-year-old Terry can eat whatever he wants.
 You are talking about my retirement party, right?
 20 years from now.
 Dude, you know I'm not talking about that.
 What do you think is gonna happen at the end of the week?
 I don't know, but I do know what's gonna happen right now.
 Topic change.
 You ever wonder where wind starts?
 I have.
 Wind is crazy.
 - You need to face facts.
 - About wind?
 I'm trying, but you won't engage.
 Why you in denial about wind, Rosa?
 Commissioner Kelly.
 Something's going on with Wuntch.
 I heard your app caught a serial killer.
 HotClues strikes again.
 Yes, indeedy.
 What the hell, Raymond?
 You were following me?
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 - I've been here the whole time.
 - My mistake.
 These two goons were carrying a dirty old mop that looked exactly like you.
 - What did you do?
 - She's up to something.
 I'm sure of it.
 Hey, it's Kimble and Gerard.
 Those nerds found DNA all over the scene.
 Take care of it.
 - Now?
 - Yes!
 You know, I know I just got here, but it feels like everything's falling apart.
 No, everything's going great, Rosa.
 Hey, cool.
 I'm not the only one that's in denial.
 It's catching on.
 I'm not in denial.
 We've had a few hiccups, but all that matters is that Wuntch planted the bug on Kelly.
 - No.
 I didn't.
 - What's that now?
 You don't trust me, I don't trust you.
 The mission is off.
 Here's your bug back.
 It's not an actual bug, so don't eat it, you lizard.
 Ha!
 You didn't specify the subspecies of lizard.
 I won that round!
 Oh, my God.
 Will you give it a rest?
 Oh, man.
 I can't believe this wild ride's over.
 We've changed so much.
 You know, when we started out, we were just Charles the jock, Amy the rebel, Captain Silly Pants, Talky-talky Rosa, Terry the stoner, and C. J.
 the ringleader.
 I'm not sure you're nailing these.
 Okay, I smoothed things over with Madeline, and she's agreed to rejoin the Suicide Squad.
 Oh, goody gumdrops.
 But do we even need her?
 What does she bring to the table?
 - 30 years of police experience.
 - I have 33.
 I earned a Police Combat Cross.
 I have a Medal of Honor.
 I own the record for most arrests as a uniformed officer in NYPD history.
 You got me there of course, I never spent much time in uniform because I was promoted to detective after one month.
 They're not allowed to do that.
 It's against the rules.
 It's also against the rules to let a pile of worms wear a uniform, and yet here you stand.
 Okay, just stop.
 Look, sir, I've explained this.
 Wuntch is the only one that can get close to Kelly.
 - We need her.
 - Okay.
 - The worm pile stays.
 - Great.
 That was our last obstacle except for one other thing, I promised her that you would apologize for everything you've ever done to her.
 Including the Michelle Obama incident?
 Yes, she mentioned that specifically.
 I'm very curious what happened there.
 Oh, it's nothing.
 But fine.
 I'm sorry, Madeline, for everything.
 - Hey.
 - Especially for Pushing you into Michelle Obama from behind and then running away.
 - What?
 - Sir!
 - It was very funny.
 - Apology accepted.
 There's a Policeman's Ball tonight.
 I can plant the bug on Kelly there.
 And since you don't trust me, you can be my plus one.
 Oh, please.
 Everyone knows we're enemies.
 - It would raise suspicions.
 - Don't worry.
 I know just what to tell people.
 Madeline and I are now lovers.
 So, we can assume Kelly authorized stingray surveillance and we missed it, but if we ratchet up the pressure on him, we might get another chance.
 How do we ratchet up pressure more than we already have?
 By making him believe that the ""kidnappers"" are serious, and that C. J.
 is in real danger.
 Ooh, what if we send Kelly a severed finger in a box?
 No way!
 I need all my fingers.
 How else am I gonna do the hang ten sign?
 Nobody's cutting off your fingers.
 I meant we would get one from the morgue.
 From the morgue?
 Man, we are always getting into the craziest situations.
 If I were leaving this squad, I'd miss these moments, but I'm not, so I won't.
 Okay, seriously.
 What's going on with him?
 - It's a whole thing.
 - Is it gonna screw up the plan?
 It's more quietly self-destructive.
 - Sounds good.
 Terry, do you.
 - I have an idea.
 So when my dad lost his flower shop, my Aunt Bruce Charles, we don't have time for a weird Boyle story right now.
 Just tell us your idea.
 We make a scary hostage video where it looks like we're gonna kill C. J.
 Ooh, I love that.
 Wait a minute.
 Your dad did that to save his flower shop?
 Was your aunt the hostage?
 What happened?
 You said we didn't have time.
 I didn't know it was the coolest story ever.
 Oh, it is.
 Well then, tell the whole thing and spare no detail.
 Okay, so you know how Aunt Bruce can lactate on command?
 - Of course.
 - Guys.
 Yeah, sorry.
 All right.
 So we'll make a hostage video, but I don't think we should do it here.
 It's too nice.
 Do we know anyone with, like, a real creepy basement?
 Yeah, it's just got one exposed light bulb and a couple of spent mattresses.
 ""Spent""?
 Oh, yeah.



 - That sounds perfect.
 - Oh, wait.
 Before we decide Scully, what's your basement like?
 Bunch of old Victorian wallpaper that came with the house.
 I tried to peel it off, but the wall underneath was covered with - fingernail scratches.
 - Ooh.
 Hitchcock, can you top it?
 Mine has mother's hospital bed.
 - Okay, Scully?
 - Uh-huh, yeah.
 I got this one red door I've never been able to open and I hear screams behind it sometimes.
 But it's probably just the wind.
 Okay, that's actually too scary.
 Hitchcock's it is.
 How do we get close enough without attracting attention?
 Could dance.
 You must know some moves.
 You were mentioned by name in the ""Monster Mash. "" Fine, but on two conditions we stay at least 4 inches apart at all times, and you tuck your tail back into your pants so I don't trip on it.
 Deal.
 My name is Captain Jason Stentley.
 It's Friday night I think.
 There's no windows in here.
 This morning, I was kidnapped for real - Stop.
 - What?
 What was wrong with that?
 You said you were kidnapped ""for real. "" Well, I don't want people to think I was fake kidnapped.
 You know?
 I'm selling it.
 Okay, let's just do it again.
 Say you were kidnapped and nothing else.
 Now he's gonna add ""nothing else. "" - She's right.
 - Okay, fine, one more time.
 Take 12.
 Just say kidnapped.
 Okay.
 Kidnapped.
 You move well.
 Must be all the extra legs, you crab.
 Don't you find this exhausting?
 Thinking of fresh insults?
 Not at all, you coffin cave mold beetle.
 I meant our relationship.
 Aren't you tired of the rivalry?
 We fight and we fight, and nothing changes.
 But we're really not so different.
 I suppose we were close once.
 Remember Brighton Beach?
 1,200 kilos of heroin in an abandoned subway tunnel.
 How could I forget?
 The largest drug bust in NYPD history pulled off by a most unlikely duo.
 A woman, and a gay, black detective.
 No, I meant a human and a rotted jack-o'-lantern.
 Don't be so hard on yourself.
 You weren't all the way rotted back then.
 There's John Kelly.
 Twirl me into him, and I'll place the bug.
 - Hello, John.
 - Right on time, Madeline.
 Did Raymond buy it?
 Did he think you were bonding?
 He was smiling at me like an idiot.
 You've betrayed us, you coffin cave mole beetle!
 Okay, one more take.
 Please stop saying, ""Don't forget to like and subscribe. "" Sure, but how we gonna get followers on this thing then?
 NYPD!
 - NYPD!
 - What's going on?
 What's going on is you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Jason Stentley.
 Kobe.
 But Kobe never passed.
 I can't go to prison.
 I couldn't even get through the scary parts of the musical, ""Chicago. "" Does anyone have a good lawyer?
 I got a divorce guy, an alimony guy, a slip and fall guy, a pizza's too hot guy Everybody just relax.
 We're not gonna go to prison.
 It's all gonna work out in the end.
 - Should we play Celebrity?
 - Come on, man.
 Yeah, come on, Terry.
 No one wants to play Celebrity the best game ever made but he does have a point.
 Nothing bad is gonna happen to us.
 Wrong!
 You turds are about to get flushed.
 Come on, Peralta.
 You're up first.
 - Let's go.
 - Oh, cool.
 So, I'm the first turd to be flushed.
 Bye, you guys.
 What are you doing?
 You were gonna get promoted out of Missing Persons.
 Your plan went to hell, tough guy.
 Wuntch she came to me with a much better one.
 Guess what she's giving me for betraying you?
 My dream job captain of the - 69th precinct.
 - Bingo.
 Look, you're not gonna get away with this.
 You were a part of the whole thing.
 First of all, Jake, there's no records that you and I teamed up together because you insisted that we only communicate - through a beeper.
 - Stupid beepers.
 We're right to be addicted to our phones.
 Eyewitness saw you.
 The DNA's all over the scene.
 And I caught you red-handed making a hostage video.
 Your [bleep.] is cooked.
 That's not a saying.
 It's ""goose.
 "" Who cares about a goose?
 I'm talking about cooking a pen1s.
 All right, this is pointless. C. J. will just tell everyone the truth.
 No, he won't.
 I bought him off.
 All I gotta do is play ""Madden"" with him.
 - Come on, C. J.
 - Hey, you know what?
 I just beefed hard, so I'm gonna let you stew in here for a little while.
 I am loving it.
 Such a loser.
 And this is rock bottom.
 Oh, Raymond.
 This is sad.
 He's the one you think of like a son, right?
 Or are you closer to Santiago?
 Not that it matters.
 They're both equally going to prison.
 Oh, come on, Madeline.
 There's no need to gloat.
 Though, it does feel good.
 Gloaty, gloat, gloat.
 I knew I never should have trusted you.
 Yes, obviously not, you dum-dum.
 John, you're gonna wanna remember this.
 Why don't you snap a photo of him?
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah Why don't you get in there with him?
 Oh, why the heck not?
 My kids just got me a digital picture frame.
 All right, everybody say, ""Nine-Nine. "" - Nine-Nine.
 - Mm.
 Raymond, I love the scowl, but could you slump your shoulders a bit more?
 Remember you're a man who just lost everything.
 And done.
 - We got it, Peralta.
 - Boom!
 Are they totally shocked?
 Is Kelly like, what just happened?
 - What just happened?
 - You've been had, John.
 You see, when you handed me your own locked phone just now to snap that photo, I cloned it to a secure network server.
 When you handed Wuntch your locked phone Yeah, yeah.
 I already said that part.
 Sorry.
 I can't see or hear anything.
 I'll just be quiet from now on.
 I might chime in with a, ""Yeah!"" here and there - to stay in the mix.
 - Great.
 The only way to get you to trust me is if you thought - I was betraying Holt.
 - Yeah!
 And now I have access to all your personal correspondence All right!
 Including all stingray authorizations.
 It's over, Kelly.
 You're done.
 Okay.
 You may have won this round, Madeline, but you're gonna live to regret it.
 You are both so gonna live to regret it.
 I agree with what was just said.
 Hey, Jake?
 I'm just gonna hold this down.
 Yeah, sounds good.
 Thank you.
 When did you hatch this plan?
 Peralta thought of it when I tried to quit the mission.
 Hey, what's Holt's expression right now?
 Would you describe it as, proud daddy?
 It's hard to tell.
 He's still piecing it together.
 This could take a while.
 Why didn't you just tell me what was actually happening?
 I wanted to, sir, but it involved trusting Madeline Wuntch, and I just didn't think you could handle it.
 But I'm sorry that I lied to you.
 Sir?
 Sir?
 Oh, no.
 Is he mad?
 I can't see anything.
 Did he storm out?
 No, I stormed in to tell you it was a great plan.
 Nice work, Peralta.
 And there it is the proud daddy.
 - - Well, well, well.
 Commissioner.
 Still not used to hearing that.
 Of course, I'm only acting commissioner until they choose someone permanent.
 Might well be you.
 After all, you brought down John Kelly.
 Wonder what he's doing now.
 He's got a much higher-paying job in the private sector.
 - Yes, the world is horrible.
 - Mm.
 But then again, sometimes, it surprises you.
 This whole time, I thought you were up to something, but really, you just wanted what was right for the NYPD.
 I did.
 But also, I was up to something.
 Could I have everyone's attention?
 I know it's my last day, and I've been in denial about it all week.
 And I still am.
 So, I'm giving this toast for no reason.
 Here's to nothing!
 You okay there, Ter?
 It's just that, if I wasn't in denial, I would be so depressed right now at the thought of leaving all of you.
 Yeah, we'd be depressed too if anything was happening, which it isn't.
 Right, and I'm not gonna say that no matter what precinct number is on your uniform, you will always be part of the Nine-Nine.
 It means so much to me you aren't saying that right now.
 And I wanna say I'm not gonna miss you at all, you piece of crap.
 Good riddance.
 Pretty sure you're misreading the game here, Charles.
 Yeah.
 I see that now.
 - To nothing.
 - To nothing!
 - Thanks, guys, but this sucks.
 - Terry, come on.
 We're still gonna see you all the time.
 I promise.
 You'll come visit me in Staten Island?
 Yeah!
 Or, you know, you can come to Brooklyn.
 There's seven of us, one of you, but we can iron out the details later.
 Nobody's going to Staten Island.
 Okay, damn, I get it.
 I'll come to you.
 No, you're staying here at the Nine-Nine.
 I just talked to Madeline Wuntch.
 She's making a personnel change, which frees up some room in the budget.
 - Really?
 - What kind of personnel change?
 I told her that I'd only spent a month as a patrolman before I made detective.
 She said that's against regulations and has decided to rectify the situation.
 Rectify it how?

Look, we all know Scully has the hardest head, but what concerns me is the speed factor.
 - Squad, listen up!
 - Not now, Terry.
 We're having an argument about who would win in a fight if we couldn't use our arms.
 Everyone agrees, I'd bite the best.
 Meaningless!
 True strength comes from the pelvis, not the mouth.
 - There's been an assassination attempt!

 And you let us just sit around talking about Boyle's pelvis?
 I didn't let you!
 Councilman Bosworth was giving a speech at Garfield Plaza.
 He was shot in the shoulder.
 Now, he's in stable condition, but the shooter's still at large!
 We have to move!
 We're locking down a ten-block radius around the scene.
 No traffic in or out.
 We think our man is still inside the area.
 ESU is on-site.
 I'll be leading the op from a mobile command center.
 Santiago is running perimeter control.
 Peralta, you're in charge of the manhunt for the shooter.
 Oh, my God, it's a manhunt.
 And I'm the Manhunter.
 And I'm your sidekick, the Boyhunter.
 - Come on, dude.
 - I'm gonna be on the news.
 I'm gonna look straight into the camera and say, ""If the shooter is watching, I hope you like living between St.

 Five hours?

 It's his first week on the job, so he's still learning the ropes.

 We have a councilman in the hospital and his shooter is still at large.
 We don't have time for this incompetence.

 I mean, Officer Holt.
 I mean, Officer Dad.
 Yep, that was it.
 Officer Dad, I found it.
 Detective, I thought I saw a clue on the sidewalk.
 I apologize for not properly securing the scene.
 No need to apologize, I wasn't even that mad.
 You said you wanted whoever messed up off the case.
 It doesn't matter.
 The point is, no one needs to get in trouble.
 Look, you don't have to pity me just because Madeline Wuntch demoted me for a year.
 I've been stripped of my accomplishments and lost the respect of everyone in my life including my dog.
 Cheddar?
 No.
 Yes!
 Now - he only poops for Kevin.
 - Oh, sir.
 We don't have time to take all this in, there's a shooter on the loose!
 Are you guys gonna be okay working together or not?
 Of course we will, I took an oath to protect this city no matter what my rank.
 I have no problem with Detective Peralta being my commander.
 And I have no problem commanding him.
 Here, watch this.
 Captain, will you please lock down North 3rd Street, if that's okay with you, Captain?
 It certainly is!
 Impressed?
 You said ""please"" and you called him ""Captain"" twice.
 Yeah, we don't have time for this, Lieutenant.
 There's a shooter on the loose!
 - - Traffic is shut down.
 Civilians are being funneled into the checkpoints.
 Good, just wish my guys over here could be a little more efficient.
 Yeah, I'm looking at you, Detective Fuzzy Paws!
 Is this Amy-hates-dogs-Amy or Amy-extra-stressed-Amy?
 It's both Amys!
 I'm under a lot of pressure.
 And also, that dog is a piece of trash!
 Okay.
 I can tell something else is going on, you don't have to pretend to be mad at the dog.
 First of all, I'm not pretending.
 That dog sucks!
 Also My period's late, I think I might be pregnant.
 - Oh, damn.
 - I can't be pregnant!
 Jake and I agreed to wait at least a year until we tried.
 I haven't found an OB, I'm not on any preschool waiting lists, and I spent all of yesterday in a room with Hitchcock and his new cologne, which can't be good for the baby it is literally called Zika!
 Okay, relax, You're probably not pregnant, it's entirely possible Hitchcock's cologne disrupted your cycle.
 Right, yes.
 That is a very real possibility.
 - Santiago!
 - Ah!
 What's going on here?
 Is everything okay?
 Yeah, totes!
 Right, Rosa?
 Uh, totes.
 Why is everyone being all weird today?
 Just get back to work and be normal.
 Yes, sir!
 Will do, we'll be normal.
 Nothing to stress about here.
 Hey, Fuzzy Paws!
 I'm paying you to work, not lick your butthole!
 Yeah, I'm gonna get you a pregnancy test.
 Okay, I know you haven't done this in a while, so here's a tip keep your hat on.
 Because of all the standing still, the pigeons think we're statues and they will poop on you or peck you.
 Both are bad.
 Thank you for the helpful tip.
 Oh, I've got a ton of them.
 They're mostly about the dangers of standing.
 A year on the beat without prescription insoles can take two years off your life.
 Any way to speed the process up?
 Okay, I've got a funny guy for a partner.
 But seriously, you have to monitor your foot health.
 I'll gonna send you a pedometer app that I use.
 You're gonna love it.
 It has robust social features.
 We can give each other ""foot-fives""!
 No, thank you, I keep count of my steps in my head, like a normal person.
 I'm up to 6,743 for the day.
 - - Okay Boyle, it's time for the Manhunter to hunt man.
 Ooh, here he comes Watch out, men, he'll hunt you down Ooh, here he comes Jake's a manhunter!
 Charles I love that.
 Keep doing the song while I work the scene.
 You got it!
 Okay, bullet lodged there is 4 feet below the hole in the backdrop indicating a trajectory of about 15 degrees, which means the shot was taken from either the second or third floor of one of the buildings across the plaza.
 Ooh, here he comes That building's windows don't open.
 Watch out men, he'll hunt you down - That one's obscured by trees.
 - Ooh, here he comes Which means that the shooter must've been located On the sky bridge.
 Jake's a manhunter - Officer Holt.
 - Mm.
 I thought I stationed you not here!
 Right.
 I'm just here in the plaza looking for, um this!
 A half-eaten box of McNuggets?
 - Yup, it's my lunch.
 - Uh-huh.
 And what type of food is a McNugget?
 Some type of a paella?
 You had to know that was a bad guess.
 Well, the point is, I needed my paella and I noticed the sky bridge, so I thought I might be of some help, but I'll just go back and stand next to a piece of police tape and do nothing.
 Wait, stop.
 How would you like to stick around and assist on the case?
 You sure, Jake, I mean, there's only room for one Manhunter.
 Boyle is right, I don't want to overstep.
 You're not overstepping.
 I mean, he interrupted the song, but whatever.
 Great, I'll just leave my paella on the ground, save it for later.
 We all know that's not your lunch!
 So, the shooter was standing right here.
 A standard long gun would've ejected the casing right over there, where Holt is already putting down an evidence marker.
 Yes, I found it quite quickly.
 Great, thank you for saving me the trouble of doing my job.
 Oh, sorry.
 Would you like me to pick the evidence marker back up so you can place it on the ground?
 - Yes!
 - No, of course not.
 Good work.
 I bet the shooter went that way.
 - Sorry.
 - Yeah, it's okay.
 Follow me to the service entrance.
 Ugh, we did it again.
 I'm so sorry.
 - It's really no problem.
 - Great!
 Follow me, everyone!
 Wait, what?
 Security footage showed no cars leaving the area, so our shooter must've left here on foot.
 He's taking over your case, Jake.
 You have to stop him.
 Well, you know, it takes a true leader to let someone else lead.
 Ugh, sounds exactly like something I would say.
 Snap out of it.
 Look, it's fine, I just I feel sorry for him, okay?
 His assignment was standing next to tape.
 I'm still gonna crack the case.
 - I cracked the case.
 - Come on!
 Hot dog man, tell them what you told me.
 I saw a guy, mid-height, brown hair, and a green hoodie with an owl on it.
 He had a big bag and he was running like hell.
 It sounds like our guy.
 All right, let's call it in to give a statement to the press.
 Great idea.
 He knows that I meant I would give the statement, right?
 And if the shooter's watching, I hope you like living between St.
 Charles Place and Connecticut Avenue.
 Because that's where jail is in ""Monopoly.
 "" A great line from a great man, or should I say, Manhunter.
 Yeah, he overstepped.
 - - Boyle, gather everyone up.
 Oh, we starting a burn book about Holt?
 Let's drag him, baby!
 No, someone saw our hoodie guy.
 Right, we'll do the burn book later.
 Attention, everyone, we have a possible sighting of our shooter on Hoyt Street.
 Detective Boyle and I will take Alpha unit.
 - Smith, Fox - You guard the burn book.
 - Charles, no.
 - Stand down.
 You take Bravo unit.
 The rest of you, continue to sweep the area in case this lead doesn't pan out.
 The clock is ticking, go, go, go!
 Where should I go, Detective?
 I'd love to be of service.
 Captain Holt!
 I mean dude!
 I haven't seen you since your big news conference which I just loved.
 Ray, there you are!
 I can't believe you left your post again.
 Detectives, I'm sorry for my partner's bad boy behavior.
 I am not a bad boy, I'm trying to catch bad boys!
 If anything, I'm a good boy.
 That's exactly what a bad boy would say.
 It's definitely not, and no need to apologize, we have a job to do.
 Great!
 Where do you want us?
 Someone matching our shooter's profile was just seen over on Atlantic and 4th, I need you both there immediately, can you handle it?
 Absolutely not, it sounds like way too much responsibility.
 Don't listen to Debbie.
 We're on it!
 All right.
 Bye!
 What's going on?
 The guy's on Hoyt Street.
 I know, I gave Holt a fake lead to get rid of him.
 Don't worry, I'm still the Manhunter.
 He's the Manhunter!
 And the boy who he hunts with - What's that song?
 - The Boyhunter song!
 Boyhunter Down by the schoolyard Why is he by the schoolyard?
 - He's gotta protect the kids!
 - Sounds terrible.
 - Really, I don't hear it!
 - Let's just go.
 - - Okay, good news.
 I found a bodega in the containment zone and got a bunch of pregnancy tests.
 - A bunch?
 - Yeah.
 It's a New York bodega, you can't be too cautious.
 Good point.
 Yep, expired ten years ago.
 Open.
 And used!
 Made of gummies?
 Why?
 Weirdly vibrating.
 This is for teens.
 That's dark.
 This is good.
 Great, let's do this.
 Hey, Santiago, nice work at checkpoint one.
 Wait, why are you guys being all weird again?
 We're not being weird.
 Do not dab!
 I wasn't going to.
 I know what's going on here.
 - You do?
 - Yep.
 You're talking about me.
 I know 'cause my daughters are doing the same thing.
 Every time I go in that room, they get all weird and quiet.
 That's 'cause they're making fun of Daddy.
 Is that what you're doing, making fun of Daddy?
 First off - Yeah, I heard it, I'm sorry.
 - Great.
 Secondly, we're not talking about you.
 What are you talking about, then?
 Our favorite porns.
 - What?
 - It's true.
 We have specific favorite porns.
 - And we're talking about 'em.
 - Yeah.
 Okay, legally, I feel as though I need to back away.
 But I want it to be known that I still do not believe you.
 Get back to work!
 Eh, that went well.
 All right.
 Let's take this thing and get it over with.
 - I can't.
 - What?
 Why?
 I have no pee inside of me.
 I'm pee-free, Rosa!
 What do I do, what do I do?
 Drink water.
 Oh, yeah.
 You're smart.
 You're a very good friend, I'm glad you're here.
 Street's clear.
 No sign of the shooter, where'd he go?
 - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
 - Why are you shushing me?
 I'm doing that thing where I listen really closely for a noise clue, like glass breaking or trash rustling.
 Cool!
 Is it working?
 No, not yet.
 - Because I'm talking?
 - Well, it's not helping.
 Right, right, right.
 I'll be quiet.
 You don't have to say you'll be quiet, just be quiet.
 Okay.
 I'm sorry for not being quiet.
 Once again, don't have to say.
 Just wanna be clear what I'm doing.
 - Understood.
 I'm just gonna listen.
 - Okay.
 I'll be very quiet.
 Don't have to say it.
 Just wanna make sure you know what I'm doing.
 - Please stop.
 - So I don't throw you.
 Okay, stop talking.
 - I'll stop talking.
 - Great.
 I'll make sure I don't do that again.
 All right, Charles, I love you, but you ruined it.
 Trash rustle!
 He's running, call it in!
 I'll follow, you cut him off!
 Damn it!
 Nice, Charles!
 Name's not Charles, it's Boyhunter.
 You know what, you earned it.
 Way to get your boy, Boyhunter!
 All right, let's get our perp back to the Nine-Nine.
 I'll tell Jeffords to lift the lockdown.
 Detective Peralta!
 I see you got the man you were looking for.
 With your help, officer!
 I really couldn't have done it without you.
 No, this was all you.
 We were in a completely wrong location.
 Which was a huge relief to me.
 Plus, we got a lot of steps in.
 I'm drowning in foot-fives.
 Well, no need to focus on who was where or what a foot-five is, we gotta start brainstorming headlines for tomorrow's paper.
 I got one.
 ""The Only Assassin in this City is Jake Peralta Because He Just Killed This Case.
 "" I don't know if we want to make it seem like I'm the assassin.
 Yeah, good thinking.
 How about this, ""Hero Cop Saves City, ""Pitt, Clooney Circling To Play Him In Biopic.
 "" - Hunks!
 - I have a headline.
 ""Pitt, Clooney Laugh At Jake Peralta For Arresting the Wrong Man.
 "" Well, I don't know if they would laugh at me for saving what, did you just say I got the wrong man?
 What do you mean we got the wrong man?
 What are you talking about?
 You know how you sent Debbie and me off - on a wild goose chase?
 - Oh, so you figured that out?
 Well, Debbie did.
 She's quite the detective.
 Oh, I'm really not.
 I'm just always being given meaningless tasks and I'm not complaining.
 So what, you're just saying we have the wrong guy now, because you're upset about the fake lead?
 No, I'm saying you have the wrong guy because you do.
 When I realized your lead was nothing but hooey, I went back to re-interview the hot dog man, but he was gone.
 And why was that?
 Debbie, tell 'em!
 Oh, no, I don't want to be a part of this.
 Because the hot dog man is the shooter.
 What?
 That seems like a reach.
 Sometimes, when you reach, you grab the truth.
 - Sorry, Jake, he turned it around on me.
 - Come on!
 The hot dog man gave a false statement to throw us off the scent and then vanished while we were off looking for the wrong guy.
 Face it, you're no Manhunter.
 If anything, you're a Wrong Manhunter.
 How dare you.
 You know what?
 This is crazy.
 You're just making up a solve because you can't stand the fact that you got demoted.
 You've been trying to hijack this case all day.
 I was only trying to help.
 If I'm such a headache, then why didn't you reassign me?
 Because I felt sorry for you.
 I told you to treat me like any uniformed officer.
 It's not my fault that you don't know how to give an order!
 Okay, fine.
 Here's one.
 We're lifting the lockdown, go pick up cones.
 - Ooh, I love cone duty!
 - Debbie, can it!
 We have the wrong guy.
 You cannot lift the lockdown.
 - Go pick up cones, that's an order.
 - No!
 - Fine, then you're off the case!
 - Good.
 Do I still get to pick up cones?
 No!
 Amy, stop.
 You've had enough water.
 I can hear it sloshing around inside you.
 I know, but I still can't pee!
 - I'm too stressed.
 - You need to calm down.
 You know what helps me relax?
 - Kicking stuff?
 - Absolutely.



 So, what or who do you wanna kick?
 That guy looks pretty kickable.
 Hey!
 I'm not kicking anybody, okay?
 I just need, like, some calming noises.
 Okay, close your eyes.
 Okay.
 Glub, glub, glub.
 - What is that?
 - It's a babbling brook.
 Glub, glub, glub.
 You know what?
 It's pretty good.
 Thank you.
 Everybody, shut up!
 Glub, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.
 Why is the tent so quiet?
 Is everybody talking about me now?
 - Nobody is talking about you.
 - Sure.
 Terry walks into a tent and everybody just happens to stop talking at the same damn time?
 You are gaslighting me just like my daughters!
 Terry, I think you're being paranoid.
 I'm not paranoid!
 I put a recording device in my girls' room.
 You planted a bug in your daughters' room?
 I do what I have to do.
 They said I look like a giant triangle!
 - Is that an insult?
 - I don't know!
 But they were laughing like it was, and it hurt just the same!
 Don't have kids!
 Well, that ruined everything.
 I know we got kicked off the case, but there is good news.
 I unlocked a new accessory for my Foot Friend avatar: a sandal!
 Debbie, wait.
 Change of plans.
 We're not going back to the precinct.
 Are we gonna go rogue and pick up cones?
 Oh, we're going way more rogue than picking up cones.
 Listen, it's unlikely our shooter had his own hot dog cart where'd he get it from?
 Please don't make me help you with this.
 My guess is the food cart garage just two blocks away from our crime scene, or, shall I say, 238 steps.
 Don't tempt me with steps.
 This is a defining moment for you.
 You can either obey orders for the rest of your life and make no impact on the world, or stand up!
 And solve this case with me.
 Is there a third option?
 - Nervously tag along.
 - Great.
 I choose the nervously tag along option.
 Okay, the reporters are all set for your press conference.
 It's your big moment, are you excited?
 - No.
 - Oh.
 Are you worried about your voice cracking?
 Do you want me to help you warm up your throat?
 - What would that entail?
 - I'll just show you.
 Don't show me, tell me.
 I blow hot air into my hands and I stroke your neck.
 That's not gonna happen, and it's not why I'm stressed.
 I think Holt got into my head.
 We might have to delay the press conference.
 But this is the moment we've been waiting for.
 My dad's driving home early from his brother's funeral to watch it live.
 Wait, he's doing what?
 If you want me to put it in a better context, I can't.
 This was very important to him.
 Holt is a great cop, and I know the demotion's driving him crazy, but his gut is usually right.
 I think we need to find that hot dog cart guy.
 Okay, fine.
 But who do we know that could find us a random New York hot dog guy?
 Hey Hey!
 Hey!
 So, you need a little help from the Weiner Warriors.
 Well, I hate that.
 Just tell us what you know, please?
 There's Lou's Dogs, he serves 'em up real plump.
 Big Mike's does two dogs per bun.
 Hank's Franks great mustard selection.
 Vicki's Vegan?
 I'd rather eat [bleep.] .
 Charlie does an al dente dog, it's got a really nice chew.
 Johnny Arkansas serves it Little Rock style, although he can serve it Razorback-style.
 Okay, enough, enough!
 We don't have time for this!
 Just tell us who has a cart at 6th and 11th.
 Oh, there are no hot dog carts there.
 What?
 Never?
 - No way.
 - Not a chance!
 Zoning issue.
 Forget about it, Jake.
 It's Hungertown.
 Oh my God, Holt was right.
 We have to call him.
 Officer Holt?
 Officer Holt, do you copy?
 Okay, cop.
 Turn it off.
 Nice try.
 My partner doesn't follow orders.
 Debbie, you're misreading the situation.
 Oh.
 I'm so sorry.
 We both both follow orders.
 So you were the shooter, just like I said.
 And the man in the hoodie was just some random bystander on whom you tried to pin it!
 No, he was in on it too.
 Oh.
 Well, I'm still half right.
 Sure.
 Is that important to you?
 - Very.
 - I'm gonna die.
 I'm gonna die before I ever got to find my twin sister's killer.
 What?
 That's the reason I joined the force, remember?
 To find the man who murdered my twin sister.
 That's my whole story!
 Debbie, there's no way you told me that.
 Nothing's working!
 Maybe you just need to laugh.
 Here, look at this video of a man being trampled by a moose.
 Dear Lord, that's horrifying!
 I know, it's hilarious.
 What are you laughing at?
 Is that a video of me?
 Oh, no, is it that time Terry fell off a Lime scooter?
 Why would any of us have that footage?
 Don't skirt the question!
 I want to know what I'm falling off of in that video.
 Stop it, Terry, okay?
 We haven't been talking about you!
 Oh.
 Kicking.
 I think kicking's working.
 Told you.
 Go with it.
 Keep kicking that can.
 It worked, I have to pee!
 I finally have to pee!
 Wait, this is about you having to pee?
 - Yes!
 - Wow.
 I guess I owe you guys an apology.
 I may have been bringing some things from home into the workplace.
 Yeah, that was clear from the start, okay?
 Now, move, I need to find a bathroom.
 Stop, we have an emergency!
 Everybody stop what you're about to do.
 Yeah, but I gotta pee really bad.
 Well, hold it, Amy.
 Holt's not answering his radio.
 I think he and Debbie might be in trouble.
 It's just us, man, you don't have to pretend to care about Debbie.
 - Rosa!
 - What?
 We barely know her and she's annoying.
 She's always trying to get people to be friends with her on that weird app for pedicures.
 It's a pedometer app.
 It's a pedometer app!
 We can use the social features to track her!
 It's $80.
 Uh, Boyle, you should download it, you get better service here.
 Smart!
 And I'll upgrade to ad-free too.
 - Smart.
 - Okay, let's move!
 Sweet!
 We're running, okay.
 If I die, will you look after my cat?
 I'm really more of a dog person.
 I understand.
 - NYPD, nobody move!
 - You're surrounded!
 Don't do anything stupid.
 Looks like we got ourselves a standoff.
 Fine by us, we got all the time in the world.
 What?
 Uh-uh!
 I gotta pee!
 Perp secured.
 Great, okay, cool!
 I gotta go!
 You guys are good, right?
 Bye!
 Thanks for saving us, Peralta.
 Thank Debbie, we tracked you using her pedometer app.
 Oh, my goodness, I helped!
 And I got four new Foot Friend requests!
 What a day, guys!
 Detective.
 I believe I owe you an apology.
 No, Officer, I owe you one.
 No, I owe you.
 Great, 'cause I hadn't thought of what I was gonna apologize for yet.
 I should not have disobeyed your order.
 I was wrong.
 Not about the case, of course, my hunch was impeccable.
 Interesting apology strategy, a little heavy on the brags.
 Point is, you were right.
 I hijacked the case because I need to feel respected.
 Listen, it's weird that I'm your boss now, and that's not going anywhere, but no matter what uniform you wear, I'm always gonna love you I mean, cherish I mean, respect.
 - You said respect, right?
 - Yes.
 Yep.
 And I feel the same about you.
 So, do you have any orders for me, sir?
 Well, I do actually still need those cones picked up.
 We're on it.
 We got cone duty?
 Yes!
 Best birthday yet.
 It's your birthday?
 Hey, so today was pretty intense.
 You mean catching the shooter?
 I know, it's a great story.
 I just hope Pitt can get in good enough shape to play me in the movie, you know?
 Mm, yeah.
 Um, also, something else happened.
 I thought I might be pregnant.
 - Really?
 - Yeah.
 I'm not, I got my period.
 And I took a pregnancy test, but it didn't work because I drank 11 gallons of water.
 Told you water was bad for you.
 - That's not the takeaway.
 - You're absolutely right.
 How are you, how do you feel?
 Are you okay?
 I mean, I was really stressed.
 This wasn't our plan, and we agreed we'd wait a year and there's so much to do first, and it would've been crazy, right?
 Yeah, it would've been.
 Okay.
 But also might've been kinda cool.
 Honestly?
 I was secretly bummed when the test came back negative.
 Should we just start trying?
 Seriously?
 Yeah, seriously.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Oh, wait!
 It's after 11.
 My interview!
 It's supposed to be on the news.
 An incredible conclusion to a terrifying day, and we were able to get a comment from the men who helped solve this case.
 They call us the Weiner Warriors.
 No!

- Clear in back.
 - Copy.
 All clear on the main hall.
 - Clear.
 - Clear.
 The service road a quarter mile away is also clear.
 Hold on.
 There's a pigeon approaching.
 Hold the mission.
 Shoo.
 Shoo.
 Shoo.
 Shoo.
 Great work with that pidge, officer.
 Detectives, switch to channel five.
 Anyone else getting a sense Holt is upset about the new captain coming tomorrow?
 It's bad.
 This morning he sighed for the entire length of our elevator ride.
 I wonder who Wuntch is gonna stick us with this time.
 - Clear.
 - Clear.
 I'm sure it will be someone terrible, but we've had bad bosses before, and we've always managed to get rid of them.
 - Let's just do that again.
 - Hey, listen.
 I'm taking this weekend off.
 Do you think you can have the new captain gone by Monday?
 I'm kind of over meeting new people.
 Gone by Monday.
 Challenge accepted.
 - Clear.
 - Clear.
 We got a runner.
 NYPD, freeze!
 Ugh!
 Taking down the bad guys without breaking up our convo.
 That how we do it in the Nine-Nine.
 You're going the wrong direction.
 Damn it.
 All these hallways look the same.
 That was such a cool walk-off.
 - 'Sup?
 - What is happening?
 Well, with the new captain coming in, this is my chance to reinvent myself.
 So say hello to Chuck Boyle, office badass.
 Wait a minute.
 Is that Rosa's jacket?
 And follow-up question, does Rosa's jacket fit you perfectly?
 You tell me.
 You know, just put on a leather jacket and become a badass.
 You also need a chunky bracelet with fringe.
 Wrong.
 Ever since Rosa gave me this baby, people have been treating me like I'm cool.
 The girl at the coffee shop even got the name on my cup right.
 It says ""Charles,"" not ""Cassie.
 "" You know, I think it's ess about the jacket and more about the fact that you're feeling confident.
 Maybe this cool version of Charles was in there all along.
 Amy, I love you, but that's insane.
 It's a magic jacket.
 - Okay.
 - So just to be clear, you think we're dealing with a ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" situation here?
 Don't know, not familiar.
 You made me watch it.
 Look, there's no point in rebranding yourself for the new captain or should I say ""craptain"" because they're not gonna be here for very long anyways, remember?
 Peralta, stop it.
 I don't want to hear you bad-mouthing my replacement around the office.
 Do it surreptitiously.
 Watch this.
 I hear that new captain's a pill-popper.
 - They're on their way up.
 - Everyone hide your pills.
 Brace yourselves.
 You're about to look into the face of pure evil.
 Ah, good morning, good morning, good morning.
 I'm Captain Julie Kim.
 And I'm Chuck.
 If you want results, stay the hell out of my way.
 Okay, wow, I guess I know who the office badass is.
 Anyway, I just want to say how excited am to be here at the Nine-Nine.
 I hear the best things about this place.
 From who?
 Madeline Wuntch, per chance?
 Oh, I've never actually spoken to Acting Commissioner Wuntch.
 I requested the posting through the C. O. P's office.
 I didn't prepare a speech, but a little about me: I was the first female Asian-American captain in the NYPD.
 My guilty pleasure is charity work.
 And what do I do for fun?
 Well, basically just design and build skate parks for marginalized communities; and that's me.
 What a gigantic turd.
 Agreed, an unformed pile.
 I don't know; she seemed kind of awesome to me.
 The thing is, she can't be awesome 'cause she's here to replace Holt.
 But she said as soon as his year in uniform is finished she's moving on.
 That's a pretty generous interpretation of what she said, Amy.
 As soon as his year in uniform is finished, I'll be moving on.
 Okay, fine.
 It's exactly what she said.
 But she seems like a liar.
 Someone told me she's a pill-popper.
 Pop-pop.
 Well, she's not lying about her rÃ©sumÃ©.
 Did you know The Rock's character in ""The Fast and the Furious"" was based on her?
 Hobbs.
 Or Shaw.
 She's not a Hobbs or a Shaw.
 If anything she's a Trevor.
 That the guy my mom dated after she divorced my dad.
 So this is all about your daddy issues?
 Step-daddy issues.
 This is a new thing.
 I'm complicated.
 Anyways, Trevor seemed perfect too, you know?
 He was nice to my mom, he drove a limousine, he would take us out to restaurants.
 But then my mom caught him cheating, and we never saw him again.
 So it turns out when people are too good to be true, they are.
 That sucks, Jake, but I don't think Captain Kim is a Trevor.
 Oh really?
 She could have had her choice of any precinct.
 Why would she choose this lame temporary posting here?
 I'll tell you why.
 Because Madeline Wuntch sent her.
 - So what do we do?
 - I'm glad you asked.
 You know how she wants to have individual meetings with us to assess our ""personal strengths"" and help us ""achieve our goals?"" Stupid B.
 I say we use those meetings to figure out why she's really here.
 She may seem perfect, but I guarantee there's a ""but.
 "" And I'm gonna find that ""but"" and drill down on it.
 Come on, man.
 You have to know how that sounds.
 Shut up, cool Charles.
 I hate this new dynamic.
 Lieutenant, thanks for coming in.
 First off, do you have any questions for me?
 Just one.
 Why would someone with your pedigree choose the Nine-Nine?
 Well, why did you choose to stay here as long as you have?
 This is my family second family.
 I have a wife and three kids at home.
 Oh, please tell me you have pictures.
 I may have one or two hard drives at my desk.
 Let me grab them real fast, okay?
 So, Captain Kim, I've been going through your files And I've been going through yours, very impressive stuff.
 - Oh.
 - Not just the case work, but look at how they're organized, the penmanship, color coding.
 How do you get such straight margins on a hand-written document?
 Oh, well, I like to say when it comes to margins There's no margin for error.
 Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
 So you supposedly build skate parks, huh?
 What are your three favorite tricks?
 Oh, gingersnap, plasma spin, roast beef grab.
 What about you?
 Ollies.
 And the roast beef one that you said.
 It doesn't matter.
 We're both skaters.
 Let's move on.
 Well, I went over your recent evaluations, and I don't think you belong here.
 Oh, I knew it.
 You want to get rid of me.
 Well, you know what?
 You can't fire me, because I quit metaphorically.
 Obviously, for medical insurance reasons, it's actually much better if do you fire me.
 I'm not firing you.
 I'm impressed by your talent and record, and it just so happens have a friend in the FBI who is looking for an NYPD liaison officer.
 So what do you say?
 So what did you say?
 I told her I'd rather stick my entire head inside a giraffe's long blonde butt than accept a job offer from her.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - You said that?
 In my head.
 In my mouth I said I would think about it and get back to her.
 She'll get the message when I dillydally.
 Working with the FBI.
 That's your dream job, Jake.
 First of all, my dream job is spy falsely accused of betraying his country, forced to work alone to clear his name by taking down the mysterious organization that framed him known only as S. H. A. D. E.
 Secondly, it wasn't a real job offer.
 - She's up to something.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Maybe she's just a nice person.
 I mean, she did seem genuinely interested in my kids.
 Look, did any of you get a straight answer from her about why she's at the Nine-Nine, hmm?
 Right, me neither.
 But guess what.
 I called the C. O. P. office, and they said the form to transfer her here wasn't signed by them.
 It was signed by Wuntch.
 - She lied.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Just because Wuntch signed an order doesn't mean they know each other.
 Will you wake up?
 That woman is a demon, and it couldn't be more obvious.
 Oh, here you are.
 I have to say how great it was talking to you all, and I wanted to let you know about a party I'm throwing at my house tomorrow night.
 Are you interested?
 Oh, well, we will think about it and get back to you.
 Great.
 Just let me know.
 Great.
 And now we dillydally.
 Mm-hmm.
 What are you guys doing here?
 What do you mean?
 We're going to the party.
 You said you weren't coming.
 You said that Captain Kim was a Trevor and that she only invited us to earn our trust so she could have s*x with our mom.
 It was very confusing.
 I never said that.
 But it's not confusing.
 I mean, our ""mom"" is obviously the precinct, and Captain Kim having s*x with the precinct is actually her teaming up with Madeline Wuntch to destroy it.
 It's a perfect analogy, Which I never used.
 What's up, guys?
 Why are we standing around outside?
 Is your walk different?
 Are you strutting?
 Don't know what you're talking about.
 It's how I always walk, bitch.
 Let's roll.
 Bitch?
 Welcome.
 The bar is in the back.
 And they're coming around with food.
 I use the most wonderful catering company.
 They only hire ex-convicts to give them a second chance.
 Oh, that's wonderful.
 Get in here and meet everyone.
 Oh, Lieutenant, I want to introduce you to my old neighbor, John.
 He's the head of admissions at the Calder Academy in the Bronx.
 Calder?
 That's the best elementary school in the city.
 Their mock trial team gets hired to work real cases.
 And, Chuck, my friend from ""Major Crimes"" is here.
 - You're gonna love him.
 - Maybe I will; maybe I won't.
 Well, come on.
 Let's go.
 - Oh, let me talk you coat.
 - No, I need it.
 Oh, this way.
 All right, I know what's going on here.
 You two still don't trust Captain Kim, and you're here to snoop on her.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 Please.
 Look at your shoes.
 You only wear sneakers for their literal purpose: sneaking.
 That's crazy.
 He's wearing perfectly normal No, she's right.
 The clown shoes gave me away.
 Okay, look, Captain Kim lied to us.
 There's something in this house that proves she's conspiring with Madeline Wuntch, and we're gonna find it.
 I am not letting you snoop around in her stuff and ruin this party.
 Oh, okay.
 Well, good luck trying to stop us.
 Oh, Jake.
 You don't know who you're dealing with, do you?
 I was a student chaperone at every dance from middle school on.
 I've stopped more horny teenagers from making out to Savage Garden than you can count.
 Cool story, but we're not horny teens.
 We're horny adults.
 And tonight we're going all the way.
 Come on, Holt, let's shake this narc.
 That's right, I am a NARC, a Nationally Accredited and Registered Chaperone.
 So what grade are your daughters in?
 They're in sixth grade.
 Oh, wait, I'm sorry, that's their reading level.
 They're in second.
 Wow.
 They sound quite impressive.
 Oh good, the food.
 I'm starving.
 Hello, Detective Jeffords.
 - Do I know you?
 - Ronald Palmer.
 You arrested me ten years ago.
 You testified at my trial.
 Oh, hey.
 What have you been up to?
 - Prison.
 - Prison, yeah.
 I shouldn't have asked.
 I spent ten long years thinking about what I would do if I ever saw you again.
 Lettuce cup?
 Uh Oh, do you think I'm trying to poison you?
 Am I always gonna be a criminal in your eyes even though I've served my time?
 No, no, no.
 I'm just not hungry right now.
 Oh, you said you were starving.
 Yes, John.
 Thanks for reminding me, John.
 All right here we go, approaching the mail.
 Stay cool, and doink.
 Now we've just got to find a private place to look at these.
 Through here to the guest bath.
 - Ahh!
 - Seriously?
 The bathroom sneak-off?
 It didn't work for Dana McAlpin trying to smoke a joint at the Winter Carnival Dance, and it's not gonna work for you.
 Gimme the mail.
 You just chaperoned, O-W-N-E-D.
 Spelling is never cool.
 Wrong, that was extremely cool.
 Now I understand why you're ""into her.
 "" Now you understand?
 You officiated our wedding.
 Whatever.
 We need to figure out a way to get her off our tail.
 - Good luck with that.
 - Ahh!
 What are you two doing over here, waiting for the caterers before they make their way into the crowd?
 We're snooping on Captain Kim, but let me guess.
 She seduced you as well.
 - Is she doing that to people?
 - Not literally.
 Oh, Michael, Norm, I didn't realize you arrived.
 Come with me, I want to make an introduction.
 Don't worry, Jake.
 You're our friend; we're on your side no matter holy crap.
 Look at those chairs.
 I know you two like to sit, and these are the most comfortable chairs ever.
 Give 'em a try.
 Ohh.
 It's like there's something great at this party for everyone, even me.
 She's serving my favorite dessert: carrots.
 Wait a minute.
 That's it.
 If there's something great for everyone, there's something great for the narc.
 Babe, hi.
 How are you enjoying the party?
 Trying to chat me up?
 It won't work.
 Chaperone's code forbids fraternization with chaperonees.
 Okay, fine, I'll just leave you alone, then.
 I really quickly did want to introduce you to someone, though.
 This is Margo.
 She's a friend of Captain Kim's.
 And apparently she invented a new type of binder.
 What?
 ""New type of binder"" seems reductive.
 Would you call a car a new kind of horse?
 - No.
 - This is the future of organization.
 Oh, my God.
 Tell me everything.
 And you've been chaper-powned.
 - What?
 - Nothing.
 Love you.
 Binders.
 So Cap tells me you're in ""Major Crimes.
 "" Yeah, working something big.
 Can't tell you who our target is, but let's just say he's done a bunch of disturbing things, and he's on the Yankees.
 You play poker?
 Eh, used to, got tired of winning all the time.
 Well, I have a weekly game.
 It's mostly Broadway stars and celebrity chefs, not exactly my crowd, but they are high rollers.
 Spot opened up; you want in?
 I don't know, seems kind of lame, but I'll stop by.
 Excuse me.
 I know you from somewhere.
 Do you go to my gym?
 Oh, nah.
 I work out in my garage, throw the tire around, grab a couple big ropes and do this.
 Mm-hmm.
 Here's my number.
 Maybe I could come over some time and I don't know you could work me out.
 Okay, we've got her meeting the mayor, her dog-sitting for Bo Obama, Malala giving her an award, but no photos of Wuntch.
 That's because vampires don't appear on film.
 Perhaps we should be looking for a 17th-century woodblock print.
 Good idea.
 Let's keep moving.
 - Hello?
 - She's coming.
 Hide.
 Title of your s*x tape?
 In here.
 Hello.
 Is anyone up here?
 Well, looks like we just found the key to exposing Captain Kim.
 It's the key that's in her pocket.
 Yes, obviously that's what I meant.
 We need to get that key.
 How are you at picking pockets?
 Does this answer your question?
 - Whose wallet is that?
 - It's mine.
 But it came out so smooth I barely even felt it.
 All right, fine, I'm terrible at pickpocketing.
 But if she was distracted, I bet I could pull it off.
 Maybe you could create a drunken scene or something?
 Why?
 What would my motivation be for such poor behavior?
 I don't know.
 Anything.
 No, I need something to draw from.
 Have I had a row with Kevin?
 Did something happen to Cheddar?
 Has a new captain moved into my precinct, usurped my position, and won the affection and admiration of people I've spent seven years building relationships with, people I once considered my chosen family, whom I foolheartedly hoped would provide me the unconditional support that I never got from my own flesh and blood?
 I think you should go with the last one.
 Yeah, the last one seemed good.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 This is the best night of my life.
 People believe I work out with ropes, a mega-babe hit on me, and the bartender didn't assume I just wanted a Bay Breeze.
 Hey, you, cool guy.
 Were you flirting with my girlfriend out back?
 Calm down, hotshot.
 I'm taken.
 Look, I'll throw away her number.
 That's it, you and me outside.
 Oh, brother.
 Come on, guys.
 I've got to go squash this bug.
 Of course, at Calder we're not just looking for good students.
 We want compassionate members of the community.
 Great.
 Terry has a passion for compassion.



 - Turkey pinwheel?
 - Oh, you're back again.
 You seem to working this one spot a lot.
 Well, we're old friends, remember?
 I'll ask again, turkey pinwheel?
 Why is there just one?
 I made it special for you.
 How is it special?
 There's a little something extra in it.
 Wait, are you still suspicious of me?
 You don't think I deserve a second chance?
 Impossible.
 Lieutenant Jeffords has a passion for compassion.
 Yeah, you're right.
 You know what?
 I will take this pinwheel.
 Mmm, delicious.
 Excuse me, but does it seem slightly warm to anyone?
 I feel it is quite warm.
 What was that?
 You were supposed to cause a drunken scene.
 I was.
 I raised the volume of my voice 9%.
 as inebriated people do, and I spoke of the resultant rise in body temperature.
 Well, you need to do more.
 More than that?
 Pfft, okay.
 Oh, I love this song.
 Oh, I'll have one of those.
 That was more?
 I paired a crab cake with a cooked CÃ´tes du Rhne, like an animal.
 Okay, we need a new plan.
 No, no, I have just the thing.
 It's gonna be too small again.
 You have to really I'm going to throw myself down the stairs.
 What?
 Ahh!
 Augh!
 Ohh.
 Raymond, are you okay?
 Someone call a doctor.
 No need.
 I'm fine.
 I'm fine.
 Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
 She's gonna leave me, isn't she?
 Oh, you're crying?
 Of course she wants someone like you.
 You're so cool.
 - Thank you.
 It's true.
 - What's your secret?
 How can I become more like you?
 Here.
 This is all you need.
 It will change your life.
 Trust me.
 Did you just give away your magic jacket?
 Oh, Terry, it wasn't the jacket.
 I realize now that Chuck was in here.
 I've had another man deep inside me this whole time.
 - Welcome back, Charles.
 - Oh, right away?
 It was the jacket.
 Now let's see if you do know Madeline Wuntch.
 Gotcha.
 Oh, boy.
 Hey.
 Easy.
 What happened?
 Am I okay?
 Oh, I see what happened.
 He went downstairs and killed everyone else.
 Phew.
 That worked out.
 Terry.
 Terry.
 Terry, are you okay?
 I'm fine.
 But that dog came right at me.
 And I have no idea why.
 It looked like you had a lot of food in your pockets.
 What?
 No.
 That's not true.
 This jacket never had any pockets.
 - This is the style.
 - Oh, my God.
 You did think I was poisoning you.
 I mean, you were the one who said he spent every day in prison dreaming of the day we'd meet again.
 So I could prove to you I'd changed.
 You said you put something extra in my food.
 Love.
 Well, you said it so creepy.
 Look, tone is everything, man.
 I've been talking to a cinder block wall for the last ten years.
 I'm sorry if my social skills leave something to be desired.
 That is a really good explanation.
 Everybody, the dog's leashed up out back.
 Did anyone get hurt?
 We're all fine, thanks to this guy.
 Tackling a pit bull without spilling your whiskey, badass.
 Eh, it was nothing.
 His teeth couldn't even penetrate the jacket.
 Hey, I have a spot opening in a weekly poker game.
 - You interested?
 - But you said I could come.
 I just think Broadway star Sutton Foster is gonna like the other guy a little bit better.
 No.
 Everybody, I am so, so sorry.
 I don't understand how Linus got out.
 I had him locked upstairs in my bedroom.
 I have the key right here.
 Wait, where's the key?
 All right, quit joking around, guys.
 Who's got the key?
 You broke into my bedroom?
 Well, this wouldn't have been a problem if didn't have a vicious guard dog that's protecting her secrets.
 Linus is not a guard dog, and he's not vicious.
 He was locked in my room, because she gets skittish around crowds.
 I just rescued him from a dog-fighting ring.
 Aww.
 Don't aww her, all right.
 She's a liar, and I have proof.
 Remember how she said she didn't know Madeline Wuntch?
 Well, then explain why she has an email from her dated two weeks ago, subject: Raymond Holt.
 Mm-hmm.
 Peralta, why don't you read that email aloud for everyone?
 Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?
 Wait a minute.
 Why would you love that?
 This is gonna be bad for me, isn't it?
 - Amy, you read it.
 - No.
 - I'll do it, Jakey.
 - Oh, the old Charles is back.
 ""Julia, we've never spoken Mm-hmm, four words in, and it's already pretty bad for me.
 ""But your transfer to the Nine-Nine is a foolish one.
 ""They are a dysfunctional precinct commanded ""by a rancid old prune, Raymond Holt.
 ""But in recognition of your exemplary service, I will honor your wishes.
 Wuntch.
 "" But then why are you at the Nine-Nine?
 - I'm here for you.
 - Aha!
 Because you're my hero.
 Oof.
 I am off today.
 You overcame so much to become a captain.
 It made me feel like I could accomplish anything.
 So when the chance came up to work with you, I jumped at it.
 But why not just tell me that?
 Because you were so down about being in uniform, I didn't want it to come across as pity.
 Oh, well, what a sweet and thoughtful moment, which would not have been possible without my meddling.
 How dare you try to weasel out of this when the love of my life is splattered all over that room.
 The chair?
 Get her name out of your mouth.
 - Her name is the chair?
 - I warned you.
 So you think things will be weird with Captain Kim?
 Nah, she's so perfect.
 I'm sure she's already moved past it, and we'll have a great year together.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 Captain Kim asked for an immediate transfer.
 She is no longer a part of the Nine-Nine.
 - What?
 - She said that she respected you all, but there was obviously too much history here and she'd always feel like an interloper.
 Oh, man, you guys.
 I almost feel like this is all my fault.
 - Agreed.
 - What?
 You encouraging me.
 You kept saying, ""Mm-hmm.
 "" I was going through something difficult.
 You have no excuse.
 He's kind of right, Jake.
 - What was going on there?
 - I don't know.
 I guess I'm just overly paranoid from everything that's happened here, you know, with Kelly and Wuntch and Trevor and Rolf.
 - Who's Rolf?
 - Oh, mom my dated Rolf after she broke up with Trevor.
 He was also a limo driver, and he also cheated on her.
 The problem is with limo drivers.
 - Babe, it's not.
 - It's not?
 - No.
 - Okay, thanks.
 I love you.
 Look, man, I get it.
 There's no question we've been burned a bunch as squad.
 But you not giving someone the benefit of the doubt cost us a good captain.
 I know.
 You're right.
 Look, I'm really sorry.
 But your heart was in the right place.
 And I had to pay Captain Kim, like, $3,700 in damages.
 - You did what?
 - The point is, everyone accepted my apology, Amy, right, Charles?
 - You betcha, Jakey.
 - See?

It's happening again.
 Rosa, Rosa, Hitchcock fell asleep in the break room.
 I pranked him.
 I tied his shoelaces together.
 You're 38 years old, dude.
 I know, and yet my pranks still stay so fresh.
 It's incredible.
 You gotta untie his shoes before he gets hurt.
 Look, seriously?
 - Seriously.
 - Fine.
 But what's the worst thing that could happen?
 He's being strangled to death!
 How?
 - So you still annoyed?
 - Yes.
 You can't keep saying ""mischief managed"" after we finish s*x.
 It's what Harry Potter says when he needs to clear the Marauder's Map.
 Obviously, I know that, but I would prefer to keep wizard terms out of our s*x life.
 But what we're doing is magical.
 We're making a baby.
 Wait, why'd you stop the elevator?
 Look, I know you're excited, and I am too, but I really don't want to talk about us trying to get pregnant while we're at work.
 You haven't said anything to Charles, right?
 No, and it's killing me.
 I still don't get why you can tell Rosa but I can't tell him.
 Rosa's low key.
 Charles can be low key.
 So how was everyone's weekend?
 Oh, uh, we bought a couch.
 Hoo-hoo, tell me everything!
 Okay, fine, he can be a bit much.
 But don't worry.
 I have a plan that guarantees I'm not gonna tell him.
 I've cut him out of my life completely.
 That doesn't seem sustainable.
 Yeah, well, so far, it's working and it's foolproof, so Morning!
 - Jake, can I talk to you for a second?
 - Mm-hmm.
 I feel like we haven't hung out in forever.
 Oh, is that so?
 I didn't realize.
 Is that the case?
 You wanna get a drink after work tonight?
 I'm dying to tell you about Genevieve's new shampoo.
 It's edible.
 Oh, wow, that sounds so fun, but I actually can't because I have plans with Ted Crap It's a friend of Amy's.
 The point is, I'm unavailable for a very real reason.
 Jake!
 - Oh, my God, is that - Boyle!
 It does sound like It's me, Adrian Pimento.
 Yeah, we know.
 Hi, Adrian.
 How are you?
 Very bad, someone's trying to kill me.
 Before we wrap up this briefing, I wanted to give a few shout-outs.
 Diaz, great job on that B&E.
 You are a good cop with a great attitude.
 - I don't like this.
 - Santiago, when I think of your CompStat reports, one word comes to mind: wow.
 And that ""WOW"" is an acronym for ""wow, oh, wow. "" - What is happening?
 - He's buttering us up before giving us some devastatingly bad news.
 My God, Jake and Charles are dead.
 Jake and Charles are not dead.
 It's worse than that.
 We have to do our annual HR seminar on workplace conflict tomorrow.
 What?
 Already?
 I know.
 I know.
 These seminars are not exactly our favorite things.
 Question: if I get shot in the line of duty, can I miss it?
 Legally, you still have to make it up.
 Well, there goes that plan.
 Sir, it's a seminar that's too boring for me.
 I'm saying no to a seminar.
 Look, it's mandatory, it's not up for debate, but we'll get through it 'cause we're the best squad in the city with the nicest hair, the kindest eyes.
 He's buttering us up again, so more bad news is coming.
 HR said they're sending a funny guy.
 No!
 All I know is, I woke up in a pool of my own blood next to a metal chair that had a dent in it the same shape as my head.
 What were you doing before the attack?
 I was sitting in said metal chair watching the season two premiere of ""The Masked Singer.
 "" The Egg had just gone, and I'm pretty sure I know who it is, Sara Gilbert.
 - That doesn't make any sense.
 - Are you kidding?
 You don't think I know how Darlene walks?
 No, no, no, no, I'm sure you do, it's just ""The Masked Singer"" ended four months ago.
 I still can't believe that the Bowl of Ramen wasn't Dikembe Mutombo.
 Four month no, no, no.
 I watched this last night.
 That doesn't make any Where am I?
 - What is that table?
 - Calm down.
 You're at the nine-nine, and you know what a table is.
 I don't remember coming here.
 How did I get here?
 Oh, my God.
 Pimento has ""Memento"" disease.
 Your memory is resetting like the guy from the movie ""Memento.
 "" - What?
 - You guys never saw ""Memento""?
 It's the guy with no short-term memory, you know, Christopher Nolan's first movie.
 Is it like Dory from ""Finding Dory,"" she keeps forgetting where she's swimming?
 - No, no, it's like - Dory, yeah, yeah, yeah!
 I'm like the forgetful little fish.
 - Ah.
 - Oh, I mean, yeah, it's like that, - but it's also like - Just keep swimming!
 - That's what Dory says.
 - Classic Dory, Jake!
 Ugh, you guys really ruined the coolness of this ""Memento"" thing.
 Also, Jake, ""Following"" is Christopher Nolan's first movie.
 You sound like a grade A [bleep.] out here.
 What's up, squad?
 Hope y'all like condiments because I got all the sauce.
 Huh?
 I arrested a tween shoplifter yesterday, and she was real cool at talking.
 I love you, Amy, but maybe slang isn't your thing.
 Whatevs.
 Check it: I got a copy of last year's workplace conflict presentation.
 All we have to do is study the crap out of it, then we can answer every question before that tool from HR even asks it.
 We'll be done in no time.
 So your solution for getting us out of the boring seminar is having us memorize the boring seminar.
 Exactly.
 It's genius, and it's fun.
 I love committing things to memory.
 Yeah, I'm out.
 I don't do homework.
 You do now.
 - Get busy, ya flope.
 - Flope?
 It means loser, okay?
 It's new slang.
 People are saying it!
 The tween said so!
 It just doesn't make any sense.
 I mean, you love ""The Dark Knight,"" you love ""Inception,"" and you haven't even seen ""Memento""?
 Jake, I don't know what to tell ya.
 I spend a lot of time in jungles, you know.
 They don't exactly get movies like that.
 It's usually big blockbusters like ""Finding Dory.
 "" 486 million domestic.
 When you factor in international, 1.
 2 billion.
 Look, Adrian, we don't have a ton to go off on here.
 What else has been going on in your life?
 Normal stuff.
 Ooh, I got hired as a PI by the Countess Luann from ""Real Housewives.
 "" I ended up sleeping with her in a tiny hotel Jacuzzi.
 I also microwaved a watermelon just to see if it would explode.
 Okay, this is immediately unhelpful, but did the watermelon explode?
 It just cracked and got hot.
 - Oh.
 - Total bust.
 Hey, maybe one of your PI cases is the reason you got attacked.
 I thought of that too, but I doubt it.
 You know, they're all the same, kinda boring.
 It's some redheaded lady wants me to hack her husband's phone to see if he's cheating with a spin instructor named Kendra.
 It seems a little specific that they would all be like that, but okay.
 Where is that coming from?
 Oh, my God, there's a bomb in my chest!
 - What?
 - They put a bomb in my chest!
 What do we do?
 Wait a second, the sound's coming from my little watch.
 You just assumed there was a bomb inside you?
 It says, ""Take pill, right jacket Po"" I've never seen these before in my life.
 This was filled three days ago.
 This doctor must be treating you for your ""Finding Dory"" Disease, that's what most people call anterograde amnesia.
 Just keep swimming.
 Exactly, that's what I tell my patients, just keep swimming.
 So what do you think caused Pimento's memory loss?
 Probably years of repeated head trauma.
 I've been working as a neurologist for over two decades, and I have never seen a patient with more traumatic head injuries.
 Well, doesn't look so bad.
 - The red is the good parts.
 - Oh, my God.
 Oh, I guess it does make sense.
 Pimento lives pretty hard.
 I locked my keys in the car again.
 I guess I'll have to smash the window.
 Actually, I got a hammer in my car.
 Come on, everybody knows the skull is the hammer of the body.
 Yeah, that's not true.
 What?
 Really?
 Okay, well, then this is on me.
 Look, this morning, Pimento was screaming about someone trying to kill him.
 Has he said anything like that to you?
 He has, but I've seen him every day for weeks, and I haven't noticed any new injuries, but the medication he's on may be making him paranoid.
 Really?
 Because he doesn't There's a bomb in my chest!
 Right, he does keep doing that.
 Hey, it was nice of you to let Pimento crash at your place last night.
 How'd it go?
 Oh, well, he gave Nikolaj a haircut while he was asleep, but no weird memory stuff, so all in all, major win.
 Great, so it sounds like he might be getting better.
 Ah, someone's trying to kill me!
 Oh, boy, here we go again.
 - Ah, gah!
 - Pimento, Pimento, Pimento!
 Don't worry.
 Everything's okay.
 You've had some brain trauma, and it caused you to lose your memory.
 You're scared that you're in danger, but there is no evidence that anyone is trying to kill you.
 - You're safe.
 - Wait, wait, really?
 Whew, okay.
 Thank you.
 I was really worried, you know, 'cause of this gunshot wound.
 Oh, my God, someone's trying to kill you!
 What?
 You just told me that wasn't the case!
 So there I am, naked, still holding the hedge trimmers when the chauffeur walks in and I say, ""Guess you caught me red-handed.
 "" - Because of the blood?
 - Yeah, because of the blood!
 See, you get it.
 The bullet went through your friend's shoulder.
 He should be fine, although he does keep asking me if we do the ""Face/Off"" surgery here.
 And what'd you tell him?
 That we don't.
 Right.
 - She's hiding something.
 - Obviously.
 Okay, Adrian, there's very little evidence to go on, so we should take a look at your PI case files.
 Don't have any.
 Keep everything right up here in the old steel Where am I?
 What is this bed?
 And his memory's resetting.
 All right, Adrian, someone's trying to kill you.
 - Uh-huh.
 - You have a memory disorder - That makes sense.
 - Like in the movie ""Memento.
 "" - I haven't seen that!
 - It's like ""Finding Dory.
 "" Oh, now I know exactly what's going on.
 Thank you, Charles.
 Okay, let's get you dressed and back to the precinct where it's safe.
 Okay.
 Oh, Adrian, the back of your gown's open.
 - Don't peek at my tushy.
 - I'm not.
 Wait, since when is your back covered in tattoos?
 It's not, otherwise I couldn't get buried in a Jewish cemetery.
 - Are you Jewish?
 - Not yet.
 Ooh, I should ask that nurse if they've got a mohel on staff.
 Wait, maybe you've been getting tattoos to help you remember things, like the guy in ""Memento.
 "" Again, haven't seen it.
 No, the tattoos could be clues that you're leaving for yourself.
 Here, we'll step out.
 You get undressed and write down everything you see, - and you're fully naked.
 - Hey-oh!
 All right, well, I guess we're looking at 'em together.
 Hello, squad.
 My name is Brad Portenberg, and today I'm gonna teach you about workplace conflict.
 So I brought along someone who's an expert in conflict: my ex-wife.
 Just kidding.
 She lives in Vermont with our kids.
 So can anyone tell me what a stereotype is?
 The Irish are potato-eating drunks.
 - And the gays - No, no, no, what does the word ""stereotype"" mean?
 - Uh - I got this, fellas.
 It's a preconceived, often prejudiced notion about a group of people.
 Great, and can anyone tell me what a protected class is?
 A group of people with a common characteristic that is legally protected from employment discrimination.
 And how many protected classes are there?
 - 20.
 - Wow.
 It seems like I have myself a star pupil.
 Honey, you have no idea.
 ""Extra ranch, no tomato, no cilantro.
 "" These are just a list of modifications on a signature salad from Panera.
 Okay, this one says, ""Buy toilet paper"" in a truly gigantic font.
 I hate to think of the horrific event that led to a reminder of this size.
 This says your bank account number is 432211378, then just under that, ""Someone saw this and stole your money.
 "" - Aw.
 - Ew.
 This just says, ""Don't trust your D.
 "" Okay, well, that's good advice.
 My D does get me in a lot of trouble.
 Are you sure that's what the D stands for?
 Oh, it's for sure my dong.
 It could tell some stories: Costa Rica in '98, Nam.
 It's coming up.
 Oh, no, there's a bomb in my chest!
 Save yourselves!
 No, no, no, no, it's just your little watch, okay?
 Means it's time for you to take your pills.
 You keep them in your right coat pocket.
 Oh, okay.
 - Where's my coat?
 - It's down in my car.
 Ah, I'll go get it.
 You stay here.
 No, no, no, your pen1s is out.
 - I'll go.
 - Okay.
 Whew, boy, I love that little guy, right?
 Yeah.
 Oh, my phone's ringing.
 Gotta grab it.
 - It's Amy.
 - Aw, Ames!
 Put her on FaceTime.
 Wha?
 No.
 - Come on!
 - Hey, what's going on?
 Hey, just checking in.
 How's it going with Charles?
 I know how hard this is for you.
 Have you told him anything?
 Nope, we're still all good.
 He has no idea that we are growing a Whomping Willow in your Chamber of Secrets.
 Well, I have to get back to the seminar.
 Also, you've ruined s*x forever.
 Yep, I heard it.
 I don't know why I keep doing it.
 I love you.
 Bye.
 What was all that about?
 Oh, I actually really can't tell you.
 No, wait a minute, you're the only person that I can tell because your brain's broken.
 Anything I say, you'll just forget.
 Well, I guess that's true.
 Give it to me.
 Amy and I are trying to have a baby.
 What?
 Jake, that's wonderful.
 Come on, bring it in.
 I'd rather not, but it still feels really nice to talk to someone about it finally.
 But I'm gonna be a dad.
 It's so crazy.
 Hey, don't mention this around Charles.
 Where am I?
 Oh, perfect.
 Listen, Denise, I felt personally attacked when you included sesame bagels at the bagel brunch knowing full well I'm allergic.
 I developed a rash.
 Says you, Ainsley.
 I believe food allergies are a hoax.
 Perhaps your rash is from all that makeup you wear.
 This is an office, not some downtown dancery.
 Okay, great.
 Now, in this roleplay, who can tell me what went wrong?
 Denise should have made reasonable accommodations given Ainsley's medical issue.
 Ainsley unnecessarily heightened the conflict by assuming that Denise had a personal vendetta, and Denise shouldn't have responded to Ainsley's complaint with an ad hominem attack.
 - My thoughts exactly.
 - I concur.
 - Yep.
 - Wow.
 I'm really disappointed that I have nothing to correct you on.
 That was amazing.
 I have never had a group finish this entire seminar that quickly before.
 It reminds me of a really funny joke about Ha, ha, I'm laughing already.
 Great seminar, sad it's over, but it is, so see ya.
 Actually, I have good news.
 State law requires that this seminar be no less than six hours, so I guess we'll spend the next two hours diving into specific conflicts about this workplace and solving them.
 But we beat you.
 We beat you with study.
 Brad, my funny friend, we don't need this training.
 We don't have any workplace conflicts.
 Oh, there's always conflict somewhere.
 Now, it could be something small, like a pet peeve, or Hitchcock slept with my wife, Kelly, in 1988!
 So Kelly was his wife, not his dog.
 Hey, before Charles gets back, there's a few more secrets I want to say out loud to someone who will immediately forget them.
 - Give 'em to me.
 - In 11th grade, I told everyone I was going to a Megadeth concert, but it was actually Melissa Etheridge, and I loved it.
 Also, one time, I ate a dog biscuit just to see what it tasted like.
 I get it.
 They're delicious.
 They're not bad.
 Oh, here comes Charles.
 Hey, man, did you get Pimento's meds?
 - Sure did.
 - Aw, thanks, Chuck.
 See, this is gonna make me feel a lot better.
 I grabbed you a water from the hospital to wash 'em down.
 Aw, thanks, Jake.
 You're gonna make a good dad.
 I'm so glad you and Amy are taking that step.
 What?
 How did you What about your memory reset?
 You and Amy are trying to have a baby and you told Pimento and not me?
 They've got a Panera here?
 Okay, I love their salads exactly as they come.
 Actually, you don't.
 Thanks, Jakey.
 See, you're gonna make a great dad.
 Stop saying that!
 Hey.



 So you wanna talk about what happened before?
 You mean the ""you telling Pimento and not me that you're trying to make a baby"" thing?
 No, no, I'm totally fine.
 Hey, coffee guy, how would you like be godfather to my son?
 Because a position just opened up.
 Okay, we're talking about this.
 Look, you're being unfair.
 There's some things in my life with Amy that are just between her and me, and I need you to be okay with that.
 Fine.
 You're right.
 I get it.
 I mean, it's not like you told anyone else.
 Right.
 I mean We told Rosa.
 Rosa, that dud?
 Oh, why her and not me?
 Sometimes you can be a little much.
 A little much?
 A little much!
 Yes, a little much.
 Well, maybe, Jake, I have ""Finding Dory"" Disease too because right now, I can't remember why we ever were friends!
 Okay, see, once again, that was a little over the top.
 Excuse me, my godson's dad, the crazy guy just ran away.
 Oh, my God, he's gone.
 - Pimento is gone.
 - Just like our friendship!
 Come on, Charles.
 Well, I've got a bean to boil too.
 Santiago always tries to finish my sentences and frequently gets it wrong.
 I do not, and I am not wrong.
 - You do it all the - Time?
 No, I was going to say, ""All the day long.
 "" See?
 Frequently wrong.
 I dogsat for Scully, and he never thanked me.
 Kelly was a real handful.
 Wait, I'm confused again.
 - Kelly was a dog?
 - There were two Kellys.
 You'd know that if you'd ever listened to my podcast.
 Okay, dude, just relax.
 Don't tell us to relax just because you're too nice to have any pet peeves.
 Oh, Terry's got peeves.
 Terry hates the way you always make mouth noises when you eat.
 Nom, nom, I'm Rosa.
 I'm eating a croissant.
 Nom, nom.
 How's this for a mouth noise?
 You suck.
 No, you suck!
 As do you, as do you and you!
 Oh, yeah?
 Well, you're all a bunch of flopes.
 - Flopes?
 - This is the flope right here.
 Okay, all right.
 Okay, guys, that is our six hours.
 The seminar is over.
 I'm really proud of you guys, lots of good progress here today.
 You're welcome.
 I'm Detective Boyle.
 This is my partner, Jake.
 You probably think it's weird that I said partner and not friend.
 - Not at all.
 - Well, the point is that we're strictly colleagues.
 Have you seen this man?
 Yeah, he was here a few hours ago for a new tattoo.
 It was supposed to say, ""Jake and Amy are trying to have a baby.
 "" - Seriously?
 - Aw.
 Wait a minute, what do you mean ""supposed to""?
 He jumped out of the chair before I could finish, second time it's happened.
 First time, he left with a tat that said, ""Don't trust your D.
 "" - That wasn't the whole tattoo?
 - No.
 He wanted it to say, ""Don't trust your doctor.
 "" Oh, my God.
 Pimento's doctor is trying to kill him.
 He must have remembered something when he stopped taking his pills.
 The pills are what's messing with his memory.
 We have to find him before his doctor does.
 - Oh, I know where he's going.
 - You do?
 Where?
 Said he's going to his doctor.
 Oh.
 Thanks.
 Detectives, good to see you again.
 Oh, I see, the villain playing it cool when confronted by the good guys, just like Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men.
 "" Do you guys only watch kids' movies?
 Whatever you're insinuating, I assure you, you're incorrect.
 Cut the crap, Doc.
 We know everything.
 That's right, your wife hired Pimento as a PI to find out if you were cheating on her with your spin class instructor, Kendra.
 And you were, so you silenced Pimento before he could tell her by drugging him to ruin his memory.
 - Now where is he?
 - I haven't see him.
 Oh, please, you're making this way too easy.
 You clearly just glanced at this door.
 Don't.
 He's not in there.
 Oh, really?
 Because I'm pretty sure that he isn't.
 But he clearly was.
 Jake, help!
 Pimento.
 Got him.
 Help!
 Jake, what's happening?
 What is this ledge?
 You must have tried to escape out the window and then your memory reset.
 What?
 I don't understand.
 Why would my memory reset?
 It's just like the film ""Finding Dory.
 "" - Huh?
 - ""Finding Dory.
 "" Ah, say no more!
 I completely understand!
 Just stay where you are.
 I'm gonna come get you.
 Okay.
 Should I go over here?
 No, why would you go over there?
 I don't know!
 I just woke up out here!
 Just stay still!
 Ah, I don't know what to do!
 Okay, all right.
 Here I come.
 Here I come.
 Uh, I'm scared of heights, Jake.
 Yeah, so am I, Adrian.
 This might not be the time to tell you, but both my parents died falling out of lighthouses, separate incidents.
 Oh, man, I have so many questions, but for now, just follow my lead, okay?
 - Okay.
 - Take small little baby steps, like this.
 You're not moving!
 I'm not?
 Oh, uh-oh.
 This is bad.
 Huh, I'm really scared, Jake.
 - I'm really scared.
 - Yeah, I know, just try and look at one thing and focus only on that until I can get Charles out here to help.
 Okay, okay.
 Ooh, there's a juicy old person butt in that window.
 Why's it gotta be juicy and old?
 I don't know, but I'm grateful for it.
 All right, just lock in on that.
 Hey, Charles, I know you're still mad at me for not telling you Amy and I are trying, but I could really use your help.
 That's not all I'm mad about, Jake.
 I'm upset because you keep blowing me off.
 We haven't hung out in weeks.
 We don't talk on the phone anymore.
 I can't remember the last time we painted pottery together.
 Sorry, I know this isn't the time to talk about this.
 No, no, no, keep going.
 It's helping to distract me from the fact that I could fall and instantly die.
 Oh, no, from this height, it wouldn't be instant.
 When you hit the ground, your ribs would shatter, puncturing your lungs.
 You'd start to drown on your own blood, gurgling and Okay, Adrian, I'm being distracted by Charles right now, thank you.
 Okay.
 Here, take take my hand.
 I can guide you guys back.
 Come on, we're a chain.
 Here we go.
 - Just keep swimming.
 - Oh, just keep swimming.
 - Just keep swimming.
 - Oh, say it, Jake.
 Just keep swimming.
 - Good.
 - Oh!
 Hey, just so you know, the only reason that I've been avoiding you is because I really wanted to tell you what me and Amy have been up to, and I knew the second that I saw you, I would just blurt it out.
 I always tell you everything.
 I hated not being able to say anything.
 Aw, that's so sweet.
 Your love for each other is really wonderful.
 Let's hug.
 Let's all hug.
 Oh, no, no, no, we're still on the ledge!
 Okay, this sucks.
 We never fight, and then stupid Brad comes in and turns us all against each other and now we're acting like a bunch of kids.
 Not all kids.
 My girls never act like this.
 We may be arguing, but we're all thinking the same thing: Terry talks about his children too much.
 Do I really?
 You all think that?
 Keep a lid on the box, Pandora.
 You won't like what's inside.
 Everybody, shut up.
 You're all acting like a bunch of Ramonas.
 - Ramona?
 - Yeah, she hated the smell of her coworker's holiday candle, so she threw it out.
 It was in that thing that you made us memorize.
 You memorized it?
 But you said it was homework and you don't do homework.
 Yeah, well, you said to read it, so I read it.
 We're a team, ya flope.
 - It's catching on.
 - Eh, I mean Hey, guys, it's me, Adrian Pimento.
 Hey, Pimento, how's it going, bud?
 Pretty good, I know where I am, and I know what a table is, so everything's going great.
 Pretty low bar for greatness, but all right.
 Hey, how's it been since you stopped taking those pills?
 Well, thankfully, my full memory has come back, even the things that haunt me.
 Hey, Jake, I saw that movie you keep talking about.
 You watched ""Memento""?
 And what'd you think?
 It's okay.

07x04 - The Jimmy Jab Games II
",/viewtopic.php?f=429&t=35959,"





Jake, will you join me in Terry's office?
 Oh, private rendezvous, huh?
 This whole trying to make a baby thing has got you super freak hey, Terry!
 What's up, dude?
 What did you think was happening?
 He clearly thought you were gonna have secret s*x in here.
 What?
 Inappropes, much?
 I did not think that.
 Amy did.
 She texted me about it.
 See?
 Proof.
 - Anyway, what's up, Lieutenant?
 - Santiago and I are going to an administration workshop - for the NYPD.
 - And it's voluntary, so only the cool kids are going to be there.
 I love you so much.
 Continue.
 Anyways, you're in charge for the day.
 Oh, boy.
 Here comes the lecture.
 ""Be responsible, Jake.
 Don't do anything crazy or fun.
 "" There's no lecture.
 I trust you.
 Well, but there always used to be a lecture.
 Yeah, well, you're not the same immature, rebellious kid you used to be.
 Didn't you and Amy just buy a family-friendly midsize sedan?
 In a rebellious color champagne which is an alcohol.
 And let's not forget, I wanted to have s*x in your office just now.
 Yeah, to have a baby and become a father!
 Yeah, he turned it around on me.
 It's not bad that I trust you more now.
 Plus, there's not even that much for you guys to do today.
 I mean, the squad is on reserve parade duty.
 - Your job is to sit around.
 - Good point.
 Besides, what's the worst thing a responsible guy like me could do?
 Buckle your butts, everyone!
 The Jimmy Jab Games are back!
 Squad, today we write a new chapter in the history of the Nine-Nine.
 And that chapter begins with the word ""Jimmy,"" and ends with the word ""Jab.
 "" That chapter's only two words long.
 No, there's a lot of words in between.
 It's a long chapter.
 The point is, today we compete against one another in a series of games, and this year's winner receives one day's paid vacation, courtesy of Officer Mark.
 You said you needed that day for a private matter.
 You know what?
 You shouldn't even be here.
 Everyone say, ""Thank you, Officer Mark.
 - Bye, Officer Mark.
 "" - Thank you, Officer Mark.
 Bye, Officer Mark.
 - Now, who's ready to compete?
 - Count me in.
 I could really use this day off to spend some time with my husband.
 Oh, please.
 We all have loved ones.
 You're not getting any sympathy just because you're gay.
 Rosa, I don't think he was No, I was.
 She saw right through me.
 Nevertheless, I will destroy you all.
 Copy that.
 I love your intensity.
 Now, Gina is gone, so we're out of a host.
 Me!
 Please, me.
 It's my time to shine.
 It's my ""Greatest Showman"" moment.
 Charles, you can't.
 You know who else they told ""You can't""?
 Lettie Lutz, the bearded lady.
 But then, Mr.
 Barnum gave her a stage.
 Give me my stage, Jacob.
 Wait, so you're the bearded lady?
 No!
 I'm Barnum, you're Zac Efron, and everyone else is one of my freaks.
 Look, I would love to give you the hosting duties so you can work through whatever weird fantasy this is, but we need at least six players and the host can't play.
 Then I'll find someone to replace me.
 I promise you will have your circus, Mr.
 Barnum.
 - I thought you were Barnum.
 - No!
 I'm the greatest showman!
 Isn't that Barnum?
 Debbie, ah, just who I was looking for.
 Oh, no.
 Am I in your seat?
 I'll sit on the floor.
 Wh-what?
 No.
 No, don't do that.
 No, I was just wondering if you would like to take my place in a little squad competition today.
 Mm.
 I can't do competitions.
 I'm anti-dexterous.
 - Hmm?
 - It's when neither hand - is good at anything.
 - Oh, Debbie.
 I was once like you.
 A bashful beat cop with long, curly hair and no confidence at all.
 That's impossible.
 You're so suave.
 Sure, now I am.
 But I came a long way, and I did it by challenging myself to do things I never thought I could.
 This is your chance to find that confidence.
 - I don't know.
 - Debbie trust me.
 Okay.
 But only because I trust everyone.
 So, Diaz, I've never been more excited.
 My first time playing the Jimmy Jabs, and I'm destined to win.
 Look at my competition.
 Little Miss Hay For Brains.
 The Hay Brains, and King Brain Made of Hay.
 Well, you're forgetting about me.
 - I'm also your competition.
 - Yes, but you don't normally care about games like these.
 Well, I do care about this game.
 And you're gonna lose because my brains aren't made of hay.
 My brains are made of brains.
 Oh, ho.
 The perfect retort.
 Gather up, it's Jimmy Jab time!
 Ooh, are you doing opening ceremonies?
 Yeah, and you might wanna leave before things get too crazy.
 A little plausible deniability.
 Actually, I wanna record 'em.
 May you can teach other precincts how to throw their own versions to boost morale.
 No, I'm not a teacher.
 I'm a class clown/bad boy with a heart of gold.
 Whatever.
 Charles, just start.
 Ladies and gentlemen.
 The moment you've been waiting for.
 Wow, he went full ""Showman.
 "" I present to you six freaks, who, through a series of elaborate games, will be eliminated one by one until a champion is crowned.
 And that champion shall inherit my circus.
 - And get a day off.
 - I was getting there, Ro-Ro.
 - Let me have my fun.
 - Yeah, Ro-Ro, let him have his fun.
 As always, we start the games by lighting the ceremonial bagel of destiny.
 Ah, it's actually the baguette of destiny because this year, we're throwing caution to the wind.
 Charles, flame me.
 Jimmy Jabs Jimmy Jabs Jimmy Jabs And with that, we commence my ten minute opening performance.
 - What?
 - The crowd is ready The freaks are here Wow, this is a really long performance.
 Charles pulled off a costume change.
 I wouldn't say he pulled it off.
 He accidentally got bottomless in front of all of us.
 - Yeah.
 - Peralta, how about we make these games a little more exciting - with a wager?
 - Ooh, interesting.
 - What'd you have in mind?
 - If you win, I'll do your paperwork for a year.
 - Go on.
 - If I win, I get your new car.
 You're joking, right?
 Why?
 Because you can't imagine someone bitchin' like me driving a lame family sedan?
 No, because Jake would never bet our car.
 Yeah, I would never do that.
 But also, it's not lame.
 It's the color of an alcohol.
 Everyone's talking about it.
 No, Jake, it's a super lame car.
 But I don't mind.
 My ex-step-son kicked me out of the house, and I need a place to crash with air conditioning.
 Look, the bet is not happening.
 Sorry, Amy, but this is between Jake and me.
 Dude, what happened to the cool guy that liked to make bets with his best bud?
 Okay, Hitchcock, drop it.
 Jake doesn't do that kind of thing anymore.
 - He's an adult now.
 - Hitchcock, you're on!
 - He is?
 - I am?
 I don't know.
 Yes!
 Yes, you are.
 Damn it, my pants.
 Sorry, everyone.
 Look away, look away.
 Oh, damn.
 Wow, who knew?
 He really is the greatest showman.
 What the hell are you doing?
 Why did you just bet our new car?
 Because it's fun.
 And because it's who I am.
 I mean, remember all those crazy bets we used to make when you were falling in love with me?
 I remember the bets we made when I found you obnoxious and difficult to be around.
 Yes, those bets.
 See, you remember.
 - This is just like that.
 - Hey, Santiago, it's time to head out.
 Actually, I'm not leaving.
 I'm gonna stay for the games.
 Ohh, look who's coming around already.
 - We're gonna have fun.
 - No, this isn't fun.
 A voluntary administration workshop is fun.
 Yeah, I hear it ends with a six page self-assessment.
 Oh, come on, Terry!
 You don't have to rub it in!
 Welcome to the first competition.
 Which one of you will meet your maker?
 Be sure not to foul out, or you will meet your end.
 We don't know what the game is, so these puns don't work.
 It's a meat throwing challenge.
 All of the expired cold cuts from the kitchen refrigerator are under this tarp.
 Voila!
 You will toss a meat of your choosing at the break room window from ten feet away.
 If it sticks to the glass, well, then you move on.
 - If it doesn't, then you're a - Cold cut?
 Yes, now you're getting it.
 Thank you, Rosa.
 - Yah!
 - Jake sticks it.
 Amy sticks it.
 Scully sticks it.
 Hitchcock sticks it.
 Holt old school sticks it.
 Ro-Ro sticks it.
 Debbie where's Debbie?
 I can't do this, Charles.
 I didn't even grab a meat.
 I'm not some expert cold cut thrower like you.
 Everyone, I need a second for a freak in trouble.
 Debbie, I once stood here in front of this squad - and felt like I didn't belong.
 - But But nothing.
 This is your chance to do something great.
 Debbie, this is your moment.
 Take it, and stick this meat.
 - Is this turkey?
 - Yes.
 I'm very allergic to turkey.
 - Hold her down!
 - Ahh!
 So Debbie's out.
 But she'll be fine, thanks to her purse full of EpiPens.
 And now, that brings us to the end of round one, which mean it is time for another song.
 It was the meet of the moment Meat, meat, meat of the moment - Yeah, we'll be back in five.
 - Throw, throw, throw it At the window, window, window So I bet you're wondering how I did so well - in that last competition.
 - Actually, I was impressed you didn't eat any of the meat.
 Well, I don't deserve all the credit.
 Scully, show 'em what we're working with.
 This is Dorothy, my pill box.
 - Good God.
 - My friend here has dozens of medications prescribed for all of his ailments.
 They make him normal.
 They make me limitless.
 This blood thinner can suppress appetite.
 This eczema pill can cause extreme muscle spasms.
 Which is pretty inconvenient, unless you need to hurl meat across the room.
 My God.
 He's doping.
 Welcome to the big leagues.
 Well, looks like things just got a little more interesting.
 No, they got worse.
 Amy, it's like Torrance from ""Bring It On"" says, ""You'll never be the best until you win against the best.
 Didn't they lose in the end?
 Yeah, but this is different.
 Hitchcock isn't nearly as good as the East Compton Clovers.
 It's like, where's your head at?
 It's gonna be fine.
 It might not be fine.
 Diaz, congratulations on moving on to the second round, said I, sarcastically.
 Oh, you're still in this.
 I knew a uniformed officer had been eliminated, I just couldn't remember which one.
 Okay, we're both great at insults.
 Let's move on.
 Tell me, why do you wanna win this game so badly?
 Honestly I guess I still feel like my parents don't accept my sexuality.
 And winning this will let me prove to myself that as long as I feel good about who I am, that's all that matters.
 That's a load of dung.
 You processed that parent stuff a year ago.
 You're right, we're going to drag brunch this Sunday.
 No.
 There's something private that is fueling you.
 And when I find that private fuel, I will extract it to use as my private fuel in my private fuel tank.
 Then I will have a full tank of private fuel, and you will have an empty tank of private Rosa.
 Welcome to K-9 Hide-and-Seek.
 You'll be given five minutes to hide, during which time Officer Frisbee will be learning your scent.
 Whoever he finds first is out.
 - How'd you get our clothes?
 - Doesn't matter.
 Now, hide, freaks!
 Hide from the society that shunned you!
 What?
 Why aren't you hiding?
 Are you quitting?
 Oh, no, quite the opposite.
 This little guy keeps Scully's liver from imploding, but it has a neat side effect.
 It also masks your natural odor and makes you smell like a dead fish.
 - Ew.
 - Who's got two stinky thumbs that stink like rotten salmon?
 This stinky guy.
 You suck.
 Ready or not, here comes my hellhound!
 I'm a mop.
 Shh.
 The flattop has left the big top.
 Uh, wait, where's Jake?
 Well, there's a TV cart suspiciously in the middle of the room, that ceiling tile's out of place, and he said he was going to hide somewhere reckless, so I'm guessing he's up there.
 That's right, Amy.
 I'm in the ceiling.
 Unlike you boring, old fogies, I found the craziest Don't worry.
 My bones and ribs broke my fall.
 Time for our next competition, So if you're not staying here, The Hellevator.
 You see, normally, our elevator can hold up to 12 freaks.
 But what if it's filled with boxes, and those freaks are wearing bomb suits?
 Well then, its capacity drops to four.
 Oh, but Mr.
 Barnum, there are five freaks here.
 Whatever shall we do?
 That's the twist.
 You have to fight for your spot.
 And once those elevator doors close, one of you will be out.
 Oh, did I mention, you have to do it all in bomb suits?
 Yes, that was one of the first things you mentioned.
 Oh, sorry.
 I was thinking of my next song.
 Anyway, suit up, freaks!
 - You're pretty hurt, huh?
 - Yeah.
 It's very exciting.
 I'm the underdog now, like Seabiscuit.
 I mean, sure, I can't lift my arms, but Seabiscuit won without even having arms.
 - What are you talking about?
 - I don't know.
 I fell.
 We're already married.
 It doesn't matter.
 Well, you guys are in for a beating.
 What, is that some kind of kidney pill?
 It's to reduce my various swellings.
 Basically, it's just speed.
 - That's illegal, and - Ack-ack-ack-ack!
 Okay, here we go, everyone.
 The game begins when the elevator doors ding.
 Are you ready for the Hellevator?
 Buckle up.
 The juice is loose!
 Here we go, Hitchcock!
 What the [bleep.] ?
 Jake, let me in, let me in!
 Are you in?
 Amy, I'm not gonna make it!
 You just go for the day off.
 You've earned it.
 No, we're gonna lose the car!
 Oh, crap!
 Right, the car.
 Oh, no, we're gonna lose the car!
 Hell no, we won't!
 She ""Armageddon'd"" me.
 I don't know what that means.
 Another love's sacrifice, and another lover reborn.
 These games truly have it all.
 And now, a quick intermission for one of my legendary costume changes.
 All right, come on, Charles.
 Quick change, no time for touch-ups.
 We're running long.



 - Ow!
 - Oh, Debbie.
 - Are you okay?
 - Yeah, I'm just recovering from the EpiPen.
 I'm sorry I messed everything up.
 I'm just not cut out for this high-stakes world of having fun with friends.
 First off, if you think you messed this up, you're crazy.
 Nothing can mess up the performance I'm putting on out there.
 Secondly, what you did today was incredible.
 I got disqualified immediately.
 Did I ever tell you the story of my Jimmy Jabs humiliation?
 No.
 You pretty much never talked to me till today.
 Well, it was 2009, it was the opening ceremonies and I couldn't be more excited.
 I even got my hair styled just for the event.
 Charles, flame me.
 I was out before the games even began.
 But I wouldn't change that moment for the world because it made me realize that not even flames can grind me down to dust.
 There is a place for us, for we are glorious.
 - You are the bearded lady.
 - We are all the bearded lady.
 Now ask yourself what have you always wanted to do, - but were too scared to try?
 - Sing.
 - What?
 - I wanna sing - in front of everyone.
 - Okay, little lady, you get that voice warmed up because you are doing the closing ceremonies.
 I can't.
 I haven't prepared.
 I don't even know the song.
 Welcome to show business.
 It waits for no one.
 You're on in an hour.
 So Diaz, I figured out why you wanna win.
 I hacked your work calendar.
 Those calendars are public.
 Everyone on the system has access.
 I hacked it.
 I'm a hacker.
 Anyhow, you took a vacation 14 days ago, and yet, you already want another day off?
 Odd, unless you need it for a unique, once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
 Perhaps a proposal to your girlfriend Jocelyn.
 - What?
 - You've been dating for a year, you've met each other's parents, and you just got your nails done to present her with a ring.
 - Jocelyn broke up with me.
 - What?
 I want the day off so I can sit alone and listen to death metal and get my head right.
 But what about my nail polish solve?
 Getting my nails done made me feel better - for a second.
 - Ahh!
 This is a trick to throw me off.
 I bet things are better than ever and you Oh.
 You really are crying.
 Welcome to my most sadistic creation.
 The tangled nightmare of extension cords that lives in our supply closet.
 Your mission is to untangle your lamp's cord, plug it in, and then pull yourself to it on your dolly and turn it on.
 Oh, nice.
 Hitchcock's coming down from the speed.
 I have a chance.
 Freaks, begin!
 Jake!
 - What is that?
 - Grab the top one - and yank the bottom one!
 - Oh, thank God that's what she meant.
 Although, I'm open to whatever you wanna try.
 Here we go.
 Diaz, I wanna apologize.
 I'm not talking to you.
 Oh, oh, Amy, it worked!
 - The banging worked!
 - What?
 No!
 Here we go.
 Go.
 Gotcha.
 You're never gonna catch me.
 Yes, I did it!
 And Hitchcock's gonna lose!
 Rosa and Holt are gonna beat him.
 Rosa, stop.
 I give up.
 I want you to know I'm sorry for prying.
 Win this thing, and enjoy your day off.
 And if you ever want a friend to sit with you and silently listen to death metal, just know I'm always here.
 Okay.
 I'd like that.
 Ah, no!
 What are you freaks doing?
 We're leaving the competition.
 Some things are more important than a game.
 No, they're not!
 Wait, where are you going?
 Don't leave!
 We need you to Why does the ceiling hate me?
 I don't get it.
 Why did you make this bet - in the first place?
 - I don't know.
 Terry kept saying all that stuff about how I matured, and I got worried I was becoming a boring adult.
 You are not a boring adult.
 No.
 I am.
 You wanna know why I really wanted that year of no paperwork?
 It's so if we did get pregnant, I would have more time to help with the baby.
 - Aww.
 - No, save your ""aww.
 "" I don't deserve it.
 I'm just some boring, responsible guy that's about to lose our car.
 - You're still pretty irresponsible.
 - Aww.
 You're just saying that 'cause you're my wife.
 No, I'm not.
 Yesterday, you took the batteries out of our smoke detector to put in your Big Mouth Billy Bass.
 - You noticed.
 - Yeah.
 - In a bad way.
 - Yeah.
 Now get up, and win this bet.
 - You can do this.
 - Yeah, you're right.
 - I can do this.
 - Yeah.
 Yeah, I maybe can't do this.
 The time has come for the grand finale, the obstacle course.
 This is gonna be rough.
 Turns out, taking a ton of random pills is really bad for you.
 Everything hurts.
 Yeah, I'm like 50/50 gonna die.
 On your mark, get set, dazzle me, freaks!
 First, you must make your way past the barricade hurdles.
 After the hurdles, you must fish a dollar coin out of our gross, clogged-up sink of nightmares.
 - Ahh!
 - Ew.
 You use that money to buy a hot dog.
 After you eat the entire dog, you'll return to the break room, where you must extract an olive from the windpipe of a Heimlich practice dummy.
 Why are you using your mouth for everything?
 The winner will be the first person to sit in the Ringmaster's throne.
 Uh-oh, surprise twist!
 To get to the throne, you must break through - a breach training door.
 - What?
 Why are you making this so hard on me?
 It's all for the show, Jake.
 The greatest show on Earth!
 All right, fine.
 I can do this.
 For my wife.
 Ah, it didn't work.
 My skeleton feels like it's made of Skittles.
 - I can't do it, Amy.
 - Yes, you can, okay?
 You just need a little energy.
 And Debbie's EpiPens are full of adrenaline.
 - Is that a smart thing to do?
 - Probably not, but sometimes it's good to be a little irresponsible.
 You're gonna make me sick.
 It's better than losing our car.
 I mean, is it?
 'Cause I will never die!
 - Yeah!
 - Whoo!
 Whoo-hoo!
 - Whoo-hoo-hoo!
 Hoo!
 - Jake is champion!
 Congratulations, you inherit the circus!
 I did it!
 I don't want the circus.
 - You like it?
 - Not at all.
 - You can leave.
 - Not a chance.
 The show is over, lessons were learned, tears were cried.
 Just remember, freaks, the real freak is the freak inside.
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, Debbie Fogel.
 And now our games come to an end We started as freaks but now we're friends And we'll all be friends forever Forever Forever Well, that was weird.
 Whoa-ho-ho, you hear that?
 It's the total silence of people reeling from the performance of a lifetime.
 - How does it feel?
 - Incredible.
 - I've never been that loud.
 - That's what most singing is.
 And with more practice, you'll only get louder.
 Do you really think they liked it?
 It doesn't matter what other people think.
 What matters is that you can do anything you put your mind to, because in the end, my bearded lady, the beard was under you, the greatest showman.
 You're right.
 I can do anything.
 Anything I put my mind to.
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, oh

Oh, hey, Jake.
 What's what's the deal with the office today?
 It it feels crazy.
 Somebody stole 20 bricks of coke and some machine guns from evidence.
 What?
 It's the first I'm hearing of it.
 Yeah, well, you just got here, right?
 Right.
 I need you to find whoever did this and kill them till they're dead.
 Bonkers morning, huh?
 So, any idea who did it?
 No, but whoever it was had an intimate knowledge of our security systems.
 It was obviously an inside job.
 - I bet it was Brian.
 - Why do you say that?
 Because he once said he has a hot tub.
 You know how that crowd is.
 I didn't know Brian had a hot tub.
 - That does sound bad.
 - Yeah.
 But we have to let the investigation run its course.
 Right now, everyone's a suspect.
 Except for Hitchcock and Scully.
 - Whoever did it took the stairs.
 - What'll happen to the person, you know, if you find them?
 Well, they've committed several felonies.
 Probably looking at, uh, 30-to-life.
 So that person could miss 15 Olympics.
 Cool.
 I have to go.
 They know the drugs are missing.
 They don't suspect me because I'm playing it super cool.
 Now, when is the handoff?
 Yes, I'm alone in the ladies' room.
 No one can hear me.
 Okay, so I know something, but you can't ask how I know it.
 - Debbie - It's Debbie.
 - Took the coke and the guns.
 - Debbie, right?
 - Yeah.
 We know it's Debbie.
 - Acting super suspicious.
 Debbie, can I see you in my office?
 Yeah, sure.
 What's this about?
 - We'll talk in my office.
 - It'll just take a minute.
 Oh.
 Heh.
 Wow.
 This morning's full of surprises, huh?
 First, that stolen cocaine that Hot Tub Brian took, now this unrelated thing involving me.
 Ha you know what?
 I think I'm gonna go make a sandwich I just I love sandwiches.
 I'll meet you in there.
 Guilty of loving sandwiches, right?
 Debbie.
 Mmm, what do I want in my sandwich?
 Let's see.
 Definitely ham, cheese, baking soda for sure, French vanilla creamer, ooh, orange chicken.
 - Ah!
 - Debbie!
 Ooh!
 You really thought you'd get away with it?
 - Damn, Scully!
 - I was planning on eating that orange chicken later!
 Is that why you took her down?
 Do you even know about the missing cocaine?
 Cocaine?
 So we don't know where Debbie has hidden the drugs.
 We searched her car, her apartment we even tried the location data on her phone, but she was smart, she had it turned off.
 Or her battery died.
 According to her Screen Time app, she plays five hours a day of a game called ""Cool Girl in School.
 "" I love ""CGIS.
 "" I just made captain of the color guard.
 Junior year's looking up.
 The coke Debbie took was evidence against Silvio Nucci.
 Now, he wanted it gone, and I think he got Debbie to do his dirty work.
 I'm sorry, you think Debbie is working with notorious crime boss Silvio Nucci?
 The same Debbie who has a denim jacket - that says ""Rock 'n Roll""?
 - It was her.
 I heard her setting up a drop.
 And why were you in the women's room?
 It wasn't for a gross reason.
 The men's room was occupied, and I had to dump out.
 Well, as long as it wasn't for a gross reason.
 We know you did it, Debbie.
 Just tell me the truth.
 Let me be your friend here.
 Thank you, but I already have plenty of friends.
 Gil, Finn, Goldie, Bubbles Those are clearly just the names of your pet fish.
 Okay, fine.
 They're my fish.
 And I took the drugs.
 I'm sorry.
 I screwed everything up.
 Okay, this is good.
 Now just tell me why you did it.
 Because I need my drugs.
 I'm a big time drug girl.
 Debbie, I don't think that's true.
 I think Silvio Nucci forced you to do this - against your will.
 - Nucci?
 What?
 She sat there and laughed for 40 minutes.
 She's never gonna turn on Nucci.
 I'll bet she's heard stories of what he does to people who testify against him.
 Man, I wish there was something we could do - to help her.
 - Why?
 Well, I know she committed a crime, but she's clearly in over her head.
 I don't think she's actually a bad person.
 She's a grown-up who made her own decisions, and now she has to suffer the consequences.
 You might not get it, but personally, I relate to someone who made a mistake and can't find their way out of it.
 When I was younger, I was thoroughly hoodwinked by the so-called good people at Columbia CD Club.
 Next thing you know, I had 16 copies of Blind Melon's first album.
 In high school, I broke into a bunch of houses - and wound up in juvie.
 - What?
 That's terrible.
 I mean, yeah, Rosa's is a little worse.
 I was in ballet school, and there was so much pressure to be perfect all the time that I just snapped.
 If I hadn't been underage, I would've gone to prison.
 It's all the more reason you should have sympathy for Debbie and understand - why she could use our help.
 - Nobody helped me.
 My parents kicked me out of the house - and told me I was on my own.
 - I'm so sorry you had to go through all that alone, Rosa.
 No, it was a good thing.
 I had to face my mistakes and fix them by myself.
 It made me a stronger person.
 So, no, I don't think - we should take pity on Debbie.
 - Okay, fine.
 But even so, wouldn't you rather take down Silvio Nucci, a known crime boss, instead of Debbie Fogle, a rewards member at JOANN Fabrics?
 Yeah, but Debbie's not gonna testify against Nucci.
 You may be right.
 And that's why we're gonna catch him in the act.
 Brace yourselves, everyone.
 We're about to pop that Nucci.
 Apologies, that was inappropriate in the workplace.
 But in my defense, that was a song that I learned about from Columbia House, Rosa.
 Mm.
 All right, here's the plan.
 Why are we going this way?
 The bathroom's back there.
 I'm breaking you out.
 I work for Silvio Nucci.
 Oh, my God.
 You work for Nucci?
 Me too!
 Way too loud, Debbie.
 Okay.
 Press yourself against the wall to avoid being seen by the camera.
 Why didn't she do it with her back to the wall?
 Face first seems like such a mistake.
 - Oh, no, they found us!
 - No, no, no, Debbie.
 Rosa's on Nucci's payroll, too.
 - She's getting us out of here.
 - Oh.
 Debbie.
 Trunk.
 Now.
 Sorry, it's a little tight in there.
 Oh, I'm not picky.
 I don't need light or oxygen.
 I'm kind of like a low-maintenance plant.
 - Ooh, like a succulent.
 - That's great, Debbie.
 - My mom always said that - But the trunk is closing on its own, it's definitely not me slamming it.
 So you guys are gonna stay here with me?
 Nucci thought we could help you guard the coke.
 Oh, I can handle it.
 I'm pretty tough.
 I take self-defense at the women's gym.
 Hi-ya!
 Hi-ya!
 Oh, neat.
 You actually say the words ""hi-ya,"" like Miss Piggy.
 So when's Nucci coming to pick up the coke?
 Uh, could be hours, could be days.
 - Days?
 - I don't know.
 Nucci just said to wait by this burner phone.
 He said he always works like that.
 Right, of course.
 We have so many inside jokes about it.
 I can imagine.
 He is pretty funny.
 He's always like, ""Debbie, if you mess this up, I'm gonna gut you like a fish.
 "" What?
 So he threatened you.
 - That's why you went dirty.
 - No.
 He offered me a million dollars.
 I had no choice.
 My dad is really sick, and he needed this expensive experimental surgery.
 - Ahh.
 - What about you guys?
 - How did he turn you?
 - Well, I've been dirty long before Nucci came onto the scene.
 I do a ton of coke.
 They call me Mr.
 Springtime because of how fast I make the snow disappear.
 Wow.
 I've never even had a nickname.
 I mean, I guess people do call me, ""Hey, lady.
 "" Right, well, I'm gonna let the Nine-Nine know we're looking for you, you know, so those idiots don't think we broke you out.
 Ooh, you think they're idiots?
 Oh, yeah, big time.
 I mean, Holt's a blowhard, Jeffords is all brawn, no brains, Boyle's a laughing stock, Amy's just the worst.
 I mean, she thinks she's so smart and so pretty and she makes me feel good about the world and my place in it, and she Smells like [bleep.] .
 We've all smelled her.
 Rosa, let's go outside.
 Hey, you know that was Undercover Jake - talking in there, right?
 - Relax, man.
 So you're not gonna tell Amy what I said.
 Oh, no, I definitely am.
 I'm saying relax because - there's no way you can stop me.
 - Damn it.
 Well, did you at least text the Nine-Nine and tell 'em we don't know when the handoff is?
 Yeah, but man, I don't like this.
 We found the drugs.
 We should just forget about Nucci - and take Debbie in.
 - What?
 Nucci is the real bad guy, here.
 And you heard Debbie, she's only doing this to get the money for her dad's surgery.
 There are other ways to get money.
 - She could've gone to a bank.
 - Right.
 And she's white.
 She definitely would've gotten approved.
 - Terrific point.
 - That's not what I was saying.
 Ah, we were both thinking it.
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.
 Our plan is working.
 What are you worried about?
 There's a loose cannon in there with two machine guns.
 She's not a loose cannon.
 I saw her apologize to a chair after bumping into it.
 Trust me, we are not gonna have any problems with Debbie.
 Hey, Jake, guess what?
 You made cocaine sound so cool, I decided to try it.
 But I didn't wanna overdo it, so I only did, like, a tiny, little toot.
 Then I didn't feel anything, so I did, like, a little bit more, and I still didn't feel anything, so then I did a lot more, and then I felt it.
 Like, I really felt it.
 So then I did a couple more, like, big ass toots.
 Why do you guys keep ducking behind the bed?
 'Cause you keep pointing those guns at us.
 Oh, my God.
 Do not worry about it.
 It's only fine.
 We need to find out how Nucci got to Debbie.
 Fortunately, it turns out she kept a fairly comprehensive diary.
 As a power journaler, I think we can hold off on using the word ""comprehensive.
 "" Oh, damn, that's comprehensive.
 These are all just from this year?
 This one is labeled August 21st.
 ""Morning.
 "" This one is August 21st ""Evening.
 "" This entire diary is about an episode of ""House Hunters.
 "" This is gonna take forever.
 I actually took a speed reading course.
 I tested at 800 WPM.
 That's pathetic.
 I tested at 802.
 That's pretty close to Holt's score.
 No, no, 802's incredible.
 She pwned me.
 I read the entire Urban Dictionary So I could converse with the other uniformed officers.
 Finished it in 47 minutes.
 I've never been so attracted to a gay man before, and I dated several in college.
 Shall we have a read-off, Santiago?
 - We don't have finger guards.
 - So we do it raw.
 Okay, I normally don't encourage such childish competitions, but this might help things go faster.
 My only question is, Holt, are you sure your old ass eyes are up to the challenge?
 I know you're just trying to motivate me, but these old ass eyes will be reading your tombstone, son.
 Oh, I needed more light in this place.
 Now I can finally think, and the ideas are, like, flowing out of me.
 Okay, what about this one?
 It's hamburgers, but the pickles are coins.
 Still feel bad for her now that she's a cokehead?
 She's not a cokehead.
 She's an innocent girl in a stressful situation who did cocaine one time and will probably never do it again.
 Whoo!
 Guess who just did more coke?
 This is my thing now.
 Ooh!
 Okay.
 - Is it Nucci?
 - Yes.
 He wants to know if I can do the handoff in two hours.
 Um, I'm gonna tell him no because I'm having so much fun with my new best friends, - Jake and Rosa.
 - Ah, no, no, no.
 Don't mention us.
 You know, because you're supposed to be working, not enjoying yourself.
 Right, just keep it short.
 Say two hours is great.
 That's very smart, and I'm gonna send him my favorite GIF of Mr. Bean giving a thumbs up.
 Oh, Mr. Bean.
 What a stud.
 Hey Rosa, what would you do if you could do anything to Mr. Bean?
 - Nothing.
 - Come on, Rosa.
 Don't be shy.
 Say what you would do to international s*x symbol Mr.
 Bean's body.
 Fine.
 I would take a very large glass Let himself out.
 - I see.
 - Wow.
 Um, I just have one quick note.
 Mr.
 Bean never [bleep.] 
 - beg for mercy.
 - Ah, great note, Debbie.
 The point is we all think Mr.
 Bean is sexy as hell and wish we looked exactly like him.
 - You're closer than you think.
 - Hm?
 Oh, hey, Rosa, it's not that you're a third wheel or anything, it's just that we're out of ice, so could you go get us some more ice, please?
 Hey, well, this is full of ice, but yeah.
 - I'll hit up the Nine-Nine.
 - You've actually been texting the Nine-Nine a lot, haven't you?
 Yeah, to make sure our cover's intact, and so they don't figure out that we're dirty.
 Is that what's really going on?
 'Cause I feel like there's something you're not telling me.
 I feel like all that coke is making you paranoid.
 No, you're paranoid.
 Now, don't you dare take another step.
 Okay, Debbie, what are you doing?
 - Give me your phone.
 - That's it.
 Debbie Fogle, you are under arrest.
 What?
 Oh, my God.
 - Are you not really dirty?
 - Ah No.
 And I'll be taking that gun.
 Hi-ya!
 Okay so the women's gym and the cocaine have given Debbie super powers.
 Cool.
 Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
 You're making a big mistake, Debbie.
 This isn't gonna work.
 I'm such a terrible judge of character.
 I was wrong about Rosa, I missed all the signs with my cousin Jared.
 - The sandwich guy.
 - What is wrong with me?
 Nothing, you're just coming down from the many handfuls of coke you did.
 Right.
 I'm so dumb.
 I'm such an idiot.
 I'm dumb!
 I'm dumb!
 Ah, hey, why don't you let me hold your gun for you, and then you can hit yourself in the face with your fist like a normal person having a mental breakdown.
 I can't give you my gun.
 You'll probably try and arrest me.
 Debbie, I'm not like Rosa.
 Here, check my phone.
 I haven't been texting the Nine-Nine.
 I have nothing to hide.
 I don't know, there are a lot of sweet messages between you and Amy.
 I thought you said she stinks like [bleep.] .
 - She does.
 - Prove it.
 Describe her stink to me.
 Don't think about it, just say it.
 Bad mayo, three-day-old macaroni salad.
 Okay.
 I buy it.
 I trust you.
 - Why'd you do that?
 - Rosa probably told the Nine-Nine that you're corrupt and they could use your phone to track us - to the new drop site.
 - Oh.
 Right.
 Smart.
 Hey, should I drive?
 You know, that way, you can take a nap and get the coke out of your system.
 And we'll both be calm and - and you just did a bunch more.
 - I did!
 I'm the King of New York!
 I'm driving!
 Whoo!
 - So how's it going?
 - What do you want, Terry?
 Or are you just here to fan some more flames?
 No, I'm just here to see who's losing and therefore has to wear this hat I made that says, ""More Stupider.
 "" Fine, yeah, I'm fanning flames.
 Fan, fan, fan, fan, fan, Santiago.
 Don't call her Santiago, call her Virginia Slim.
 - Because I'm smoking her.
 - Damn, Ray!
 You guys are moving fast, but there's no way you're actually comprehending anything.
 I'm taking my time and reading deliberately, and you know what they say, slow and steady wins the race.
 Psh, classic reg-reader bullcrap.
 Yeah, what are you gonna say next, that you read to relax?
 This is so much better than that dump of a hotel, right?
 This place has six chimneys.
 Uh, hey, Debbie, whose house is this?
 Oh, it's mine.
 I own it, um, until 11:00 a. m. on Monday.
 We have to be out by then, or it's another $45,000 to Airbnb.
 But until then, I'm a mansion girl.
 What happened to using the money for your father's surgery?
 Was that a lie?
 No.
 My dad really is sick, but I found out this morning that my stupid brother Derek already paid for his surgery.
 He thinks he so great 'cause he's, like, a big shot lawyer, and he has a family, and he's not afraid of ghosts.
 Well, guess what?
 I get to keep the cash now.
 So take that, Derek, and, you know, put it.
 She's a mansion girl She's so rich and she's hot She's a mansion girl With a kitchen island - Little pitchy.
 - Still think Debbie's a good person?
 Not gonna lie, the whole dad reveal did not help my case.
 All right, I'm gonna use her burner phone to call the Nine-Nine.
 Look what I found.
 Do you like it, Jake?
 Uh, yes!
 I love it.
 Real Cruella de Vil vibes.



 No, no, no.
 I'm not Cruella de Vil.
 I would never hurt dogs.
 - I'm Perdita!
 - Who?
 The romantic lead of the film.
 Pongo's wife.
 - The girl dog.
 - Yes, yes!
 Of course, you look exactly like Perdita.
 Oh, my God.
 Thank you so much.
 - Hey, Debbie?
 - Hm?
 Will you hand me your phone so I can take your picture and you can Gram this?
 I mean, the house, this coat, you're gonna wanna show this off to people, right?
 That is such a good idea.
 I do wanna show off to people.
 I just have to make a quick call.
 Hi, Mom.
 Do you like my mansion?
 Deborah Lyn, why are you holding a gun?
 Oh, my God, Mom!
 I'm wearing a fur coat and that's what you focus on?
 I hate you so freaking much.
 This is ridiculous.
 Neither of you have even taken a bathroom break.
 Are you kidding me?
 Do you think world record-holder Howard Berg would stop in the middle of a read-off to expel?
 Ow.
 - What's going on, Santiago?
 - It's nothing.
 It's my guide finger.
 I've got paper burn.
 - Let me see.
 - Hm.
 Santiago, you're hurt.
 Don't be a hero.
 Damn.
 You must've been cooking.
 - I was.
 - Let's take a break, - put some ointment on that.
 - Right.
 And when I come back, my finger's slipping all over the page.
 Nice try.
 I'm not falling for any of your tricks.
 Oh, but you already have.
 While you were waggling your finger in the air, I've been reading all this time out of the corner of my eye.
 Damn it!
 Why are you doing this, Deborah Lyn?
 Because you're being so mean, Mom.
 Also, I know that if I didn't tie you up, you'd probably go run and find your phone - so you could call Derek.
 - Maybe we should call Derek.
 - He could help.
 He's a lawyer.
 - Yeah, I know he's a lawyer.
 Do you think you could go more than five minutes without bringing that up?
 You have to get the gun from her.
 I know, but how do I get close enough?
 There's one way.
 She clearly has a thing for you.
 Why do you say that?
 Just because she has a fantasy of us as a dog couple?
 Wait.
 Yeah, I see it.
 That's gonna work.
 Very tacky.
 And it's like, you don't even care how many chimneys I have.
 Hey, sorry to interrupt.
 Mrs.
 Fogle, we weren't introduced.
 I'm Jake, Debbie's boyfriend.
 - You are?
 We are?
 - I mean, - yeah, if you're into it.
 - I am.
 I do.
 See, Mom.
 I am with someone.
 All those psychics were wrong.
 - So listen, babe - Yes, babe?
 - I was thinking - About what, babe?
 - That we - Go on, babe.
 Wow, you really latched onto the babe thing.
 - I love it.
 - Great, great, great.
 Well, anyways, I was just gonna say that, you know, once we're done with this big score, we need a place to hide out.
 Somewhere where the cops could never find us.
 - Ooh, like Epcot.
 - Uhh, yes, Epcot is great.
 That's exactly what I was thinking.
 We can kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, on the canals of Venice, oh, in the Canada pavilion.
 Yes, but why wait till the Canada Pavilion when we can start right now?
 - Huh?
 - Oh, my God.
 - This is happening.
 - Come here.
 Eh Hi-ya!
 What the hell, babe?
 Debbie, what's your plan here?
 - Talk to me.
 - Why?
 So you can just tell me more beautiful lies?
 You think you can just lick your lips - and make me weak in the knees?
 - No.
 Nice try, but I closed my eyes so I didn't even see it.
 Oh, come on.
 Oh.
 Nucci's on his way.
 And I'm about to be rich.
 Debbie, this is bad.
 You don't wanna be an accessory to murder.
 W-What are you talking about?
 What do you think is gonna happen when Nucci gets here and finds two cops?
 He's gonna kills us.
 Yeah, I know that.
 Um, I've obviously thought all this through, and it all is going according to my plans.
 I'm sorry, I just started trembling and I accidentally Debbie, please, just put the gun down!
 I just talked to the manager at the hotel where the handoff was happening.
 He said Debbie's room was empty, and there's no sign of Rosa or Jake.
 Is there anything in those diaries - that can help us find 'em?
 - Debbie mentioned her mom a bunch in one of the ones I read.
 Seems like she tells her everything.
 Ooh, that's a good lead.
 It is a good lead, isn't it?
 Did you hear that, speed freaks?
 Let's find out all we can about the mom.
 I'll start reading right away - because slow and steady wins - Her mother's name - is Margaret Jean Fogle.
 - She lives in Bensonhurst.
 - She drives a maroon Lexus.
 - Vanity plates, ""DEREKSMOM.
 "" She's been married three times.
 - To Horace Mills.
 - Then Frank Yelter.
 - And then James Fogle.
 - She goes grocery shopping - on Tuesdays.
 - Water aerobics on Wednesdays.
 - Book club on Fridays.
 - She drinks too much wine.
 - Always a pinot grigio.
 - Always from Napa.
 The race.
 Slow and steady wins the race.
 Okay, uh, what if I just tell Nucci not to kill you?
 You know, we're business partners, we make all of our business decisions together.
 Yep, we're all gonna die today.
 Debbie, if you just untie us, we can help you get out of here.
 Okay, but if I untie you, you'll arrest me, and then I'll go to prison for the rest of my life.
 You'll be in prison anyway.
 I guarantee you if anything happens to us, the Nine-Nine will hunt you down.
 Okay, okay, okay.
 Maybe I should surrender.
 Uh, but I don't wanna go to jail.
 Okay, I don't know what to do.
 Um, Mom, help me.
 Now you need my help?
 Please, it doesn't matter what I say.
 You're still gonna mess it up.
 Just like you messed up your bangs when you had to cut your own hair.
 Yeah, I'm sure that was a long time ago.
 - That was last year.
 - I see.
 Or when you got in a car accident when your brother was going to take the bar.
 Or when you lost all your money investing in that cruise line for cats.
 - Feline Cruise Line.
 - You know what?
 - You're not my daughter anymore.
 - What?
 - What are you saying?
 - You have embarrassed me and the family for the last time.
 - I'm done with you.
 Good-bye.
 - Shut up, Margaret!
 Same crap my parents pulled.
 Always pointing out my flaws, never helping and then bailing when things got messy.
 - You know, I was a lot like you.
 - You were holed up with a ton of cocaine and a bunch of guns?
 - That's my business.
 - What?
 I spent years telling myself that tough love made me stronger, but you know what I really wish they'd done?
 - What?
 - Been nice to me.
 I wish they would've told me I made a mistake, but they still loved me and they would help me try to figure it out.
 Would've saved me a lot of pain.
 Debbie, you have made some really bad choices today.
 - Really bad.
 - Not now, Debbie's mom.
 You are not a bad person.
 If we get out of this alive, I promise you I will help you however I can.
 Wow.
 Thank you.
 Oh, your back is very wet.
 Yeah, I guess between the fur coat and all the cocaine, I've been sweating a lot.
 That's Nucci.
 He's here.
 Hi, Debbie.
 Do you have something for me?
 Yes, I do.
 I do have something.
 - I have two friends.
 - What the hell is this?
 - Drop your weapons.
 - No way.
 You drop your weapons.
 NYPD!
 Everyone down on the ground!
 Down on the ground, right now!
 Put 'em down.
 - Don't do anything stupid.
 - I will shoot her.
 - Put down your gun.
 - Oh, man, grabbing Debbie was a big mistake.
 What do you mean by Hi-ya!
 Whoa, Debbie, that was amazing.
 Thanks.
 By the way, Jake thinks you smell like.
 What?
 That's weird.
 I don't know why she said that.
 Anyways, let's get Debbie into a cop car.
 Well, you really gonna help out Debbie or did you just say all that stuff so she'd let us go?
 I told the DA she cooperated and he agreed to be lenient, especially since we got Nucci and the cocaine was returned.
 Except for the pound of it that Debbie did.
 Yeah.
 The paramedic said he had never heard a human heart beat that loudly.
 He could hear it outside of her body.
 Ugh.
 She'll probably get ten years.
 It's better than 30.
 Let's be real, Debbie's life wasn't gonna begin till she was 50 anyway.
 Yeah, the kooky aunt vibe will probably play a lot better then.
 So hey, one more thing.
 We can never let anyone know that we got beat up - by Debbie Fogle.
 - Agreed.
 - Take it to the grave?
 - To the grave.
 This conversation never happened.
 I don't even know who you are.
 - That's hurtful.
 - You took it too far.
 That's a weird thing for a stranger to say.
 Bye.
 Okay.

Thanks, everybody, for coming out to Hitchcock's divorce party.  
Why is the cake two men getting married?  
That's me and Hitchcock.
The boys are back together!  
This cake is for a gay wedding.  
- The inside is a rainbow.
- Nuh-uh.  
It's my favorite flavor: all the flavors!  
I can't believe Bethany's gone.  
- It was so out of the blue.
- Well, not entirely.  
I mean, she did have an affair with her hairdresser, and you filmed it and threatened to release the tape, and then she said she didn't care and put it on the Internet herself,    and then when it started to make money, you sued her for half the profits.
And then boom, out of the blue: divorce papers.   
Aw, buddy, you'll be okay.   
It doesn't feel like it.   
My heart is ruined forever.
I'm done with love.   
I'll never find anyone as...   
Oh, my God!
Get a load of the can on her!   
See ya dorks, I'm gonna get some.   
Well, Hitchcock still sucks.

♪ ♪   
Hey, did you get my sexy calendar invite?   
You mean the one titled "" :   pm coitus""?   
Yes, and the one titled  :   foreplay.   
You didn't accept either invite.   
Oh. I can start foreplay later.   
No, no, no.   
I love foreplay, as you know.   
It's just... this is all feeling a little overscheduled, you know?   
It might be taking some of the fun out of making a baby.   
Oh, okay. So what are you suggesting?   
Maybe we try this The Jake Way.   
Eating dinner starting with dessert?   
That's one Jake Way. You know?   
The Jake Way is a brand.   
It encompasses a whole lifestyle.   
So get ready, because this month, we're making a baby The Jake Way.   
Okay, I'm in. Sounds fun.   
- So, are we doing tonight, or...
- Oh, no, no, no.   
The Jake Way does not believe in scheduling.   
You gotta just let go.   
You don't know what The Jake Way is.   
Nope, but we've got a name for it, and that's a great start.   
The Jake Way!   
Lieutenant, as you know,   
I've been walking the same beat for the past three weeks.   
It's become a bit tedious.   
I thought you loved tedium.   
I love monotony. They're very different.   
I'm sorry, but you know our policy is that uniformed officers must walk the same beat for six months.   
It's how they become familiar with the community they serve.   
Well, surely you can make an exception for me.   
I can't play favorites.   
You never did when you were in charge.   
- Of course I did.
- Really?   
I never got any special treatment.   
I think you can do the math there.   
Damn.   
Well, think of it this way:   
It's like doing reps at a gym.   
Doing something over and over again   
is how you make your pecs pop.   
The only muscle I care to work out is my brain.   
Then get those reps in and make that brain pop.   
Pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop.   
What you're describing is an aneurism.   
Pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop.   
It's official! I'm in love.   
I just spent the night with the woman of my dreams.   
The lady from your divorce party?   
Yeah. She's my soulmate.   
She's funny. She's beautiful.   
- She has almost no scars.
- Hot biscuits.   
It sounds like you hooked a live one.   
I know; we walked along the river for hours, just talking and laughing.   
She even gave me her real number.   
- Really?
- Check it out.   
That's just a dirty old napkin covered in sauce.   
Oh, no. Her number! It's totally ruined.   
I knew I shouldn't have had those breakfast wings.   
Oh, bud, I'm so sorry.   
Now all I have to remember her by is this tooth.   
What the hell? Why do you have that?   
We were eating pizza, and it fell out of her mouth.   
Well, this is perfect.
We can use it to find her.   
- What do you mean?
- We just have to try fitting that tooth into the mouth of every woman in New York City till we find the matching gum hole of your one true love.    
My life is like a fairytale!    
So, Lieutenant, sorry to take up your time.    
I just wanted to go over the CompStat numbers with you real quick.    
- Um, what the...
- _    
Is something wrong?
Are the CompStat numbers bad?    
_    
The numbers are fine and I have to go.    
Oh, okay, then why'd you ask for this meeting?    
Don't follow me, Terry.    
What? I wasn't going to!    
This was a very confusing interaction!    
- [phone buzzing]
- Hmm.    
- Hello?
- Hello, Sergeant Santiago. 
I've taken your husband hostage. 
If you ever want to make a baby with him, 
you'll do exactly as I say. 
Jake, where are you?    
Oh, this isn't Jake.
This is the Syndicate. 
And you will never see us, because we are everywhere and we... 
You're by the elevators.    
Dammit! Don't... look away! Look away!    
- Okay.
- Yes, that's better. 
On top of the copier, there's a headset. 
Put it on and get in the limo that's waiting out front. 
Mm, okay, I love you.    
I love you, too. Now go!    
Are you Amy?    
- Tell him ""yes.""
- Yes.    
How does it feel to be played like a puppet?    
Okay, I'm walking into the apartment.    
Why did you have me get $    out of the ATM?    
Good question.
It's to pay for the Airbnb. 
You're giving them $    in cash?    
I broke several lamps while trying to hide in the dark. 
- Now, turn on the lights.
- Okay.    
Hello... it's me.    
Put down the drinks.    
Why? Are you upset?    
Yeah, and now I have to take The Syndicate down.    
Oh, my goodness.    
To be clear, by ""take down The Syndicate,"" you mean we're gonna have...    
- We're gonna have s*x, yeah.
- Okay.    
Yeah, absolutely. Take your clothes off.    
- [animals squeaking]
- Boyle, what are those?    
My guinea pigs. This lady is Claire.    
And this guy is also named Claire.    
You can't have pets in here.
This is a police precinct.    
I know, I'm sorry.    
I got them for Nikolaj's birthday, but it turns out he's allergic and the pet store won't take them back.    
I've got a friend who works in a lab.    
I can call and see if they need any guinea pigs for their research.    
They are not science experiments!    
They are living creatures with rich inner lives.    
Claire number two is stuck on his back like a bug.    
Oh, I'll handle this.    
[cage rustling]    
Flip! Flip!    
Oh, I flipped the wrong Claire.    
Stop flipping guinea pigs and get them out of here!    
I'll make 'em disappear, Lieutenant.    
Oh! Don't kill them.    
They have so much to live for.    
They haven't even been to Manhattan yet.    
Okay, coast is clear.    
I know a safe place we can hide these guys until we can find homes for them.    
You're not going to murder them?    
Hell no. I love animals.    
I'm the mushy one on the squad.    
Right, of course.    
Here it is. Supply closet K.    
It's full of CPR training babies.    
No one goes in there because it's too creepy.    
Oh my God.    
It's perfect.    
Well, I don't want to take all the credit, but I'm pretty sure doing it The Jake Way worked and we're getting pregnant.    
That would be incredible, but feels like you're setting us up for disappointment.    
No, I'm just being optimistic.    
You're amazing, we're amazing, and it definitely worked.    
- It didn't work.
- Ugh!    
I knew it. I got bum nards!    
- Jake!
- Right, gotta stay optimistic.    
We can do this!    
So how are you feeling? 
Well, I'm pretty bummed, but...    
Amy, could you open your mouth for me?    
- What? No.
- Forget it, I just saw.    
She's got all her teeth...    
- [scoffs]
- Even the back ones.    
Did that turn your mood around?    
Nope. But it's okay.    
I figured out how we're gonna get pregnant.    
By doubling down on The Jake Way?    
Ooh, do you think we could rent the phone booth from the movie ""Phone Booth""?    
No, from now on, we're gonna do it The Amy Way.    
Does that mean we're going back to    
- the overly scheduled s*x thing?
- No.    
We're going way more scheduled.    
Ah, so even less fun.    
Big time.    
This is a test, and we're failing.    
Because we're not studying hard enough.    
Or maybe this is just one of those tests you can't study for?    
[laughs maniacally]    
Oh, wow, that's a new laugh.    
Come on. We're going binder shopping.    
[sighs]    
I'm off to walk my beat again, much like Sisyphus, condemned to push the same boulder up the same hill day in and day out.    
You know, according to French Philosopher Albert Camus,    
Sisyphus achieved happiness in that absurd repetition.    
Any French philosophy post-Rousseau is essentially a magazine.    
You rube.    
Oh, hey, Boyle!    
Do you have the  th Street case file...    
Wait. What's that?    
Uh, this? It's... my water bottle.    
It looks like a water bottle from a guinea pig cage.    
True, I got it for the guinea pigs, but they're not here anymore.    
So I decided to be green and use it for myself.    
[water sloshing, Boyle suckling]    
Ah! Thirst quenched.    
What took you so long?    
[sighs] Terry almost caught me.    
I had to drink from the guinea pigs' water bottle.    
Amazingly, he...    
- Totally bought you'd do that?
- Mm-hmm.    
Yeah, I'm not surprised at all.    
Good news.
My niece will take the two Claires.    
She wants them as pets.    
That is great! Okay.    
Now we just need to find a home for ten more.    
Ten?    
Boy Claire got girl Claire pregnant and made a bunch of little baby Claires.    
Oh, they're having s*x again.    
- Mm-hmm.
- BOTH: Oh, Claire.    
- Claire.
- Claire.    
I gotta say, I'm loving these.    
I always wanted to wear Hammer pants.    
- Stop.
- Hammer time?    
No. Stop joking around.    
You're wearing those pants to keep your testicles away from your body's warm core so your sperm don't overheat.    
Well, I am loving the breeze.
I feel like I'm   .    
All right, focus up.    
This is our pregnancy war room.    
On the master calendar, we will track ovulation windows, menstruation cycles,    
- and every uterine deposit.
- ""Uterine deposit""?    
Is that what we're calling s*x?
It seems a little clinical.    
Well, you could always shorten it to U.D. or ""ud.""    
Yeah, I don't want to do that.    
Here's a list of everything you cannot eat while we are trying to conceive.    
No more nachos?    
Even if they're in a novelty baseball helmet?    
- No.
- Whoa, this is serious.    
We will adhere to a strict exercise regimen and sleep schedule.    
Also, no more video games, because they cause stress and they raise your heart rate.    
More stress than being a police officer?    
Jake, I've seen you play ""Mario Party.""    
Wario cheats!    
I'm just saying, Wario cheats.    
It's a stupid game.    
Look, I know it isn't easy, but this could increase our chances of getting pregnant by   %.    
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.    
So how do we get it started:

Swallow    vitamins each.

Congratulations, Hitchcock, it's the first wedding I've ever been to    
- with a cover charge.
- It's for our honeymoon.    
We're going to Barbados, and we'll have the island all to ourselves, because it's Dengue Fever season.    
But your wife is pregnant.    
You can't live in fear.    
Don't want to spend every moment worried about Dengue or black mold or those weird spots on the MRI they found on your brain.    
Hitchcock, is your brain okay?    
The point is: I don't care.    
Also, Anna's family is from the Old Country and kind of conservative, so try not to mention the baby to them.    
Perfect; I'll just do what I always do at weddings: not talk to anyone I don't know already.    
You're the best, Jake.    
That's why you're the baby's godfather.    
Wait. I am?    
Ugh.    
I can't believe they're pregnant and we're not.    
How did they do it?    
They got drunk and had s*x in a public park next to a skunk.    
Hitchcock sent me a very long text with a lot of details in it.    
I think it was meant for Scully.    
Ugh, the world is officially upside down.    
Wait a minute. Maybe that's it.    
We tried getting pregnant The Jake Way; we tried The Amy Way.    
Maybe it's time we tried it...    
The Hitchcock Way.    
What's The Hitchcock Way?    
In every situation, make the worst possible choice.    
Okay. What the hell?    
Nothing else is working.    
Let's try it The Hitchcock Way.    
All right, so first move: Get hammered.    
[grunts] Drink up.    
Uh, these are someone else's.
There's lipstick on mine.    
Yeah, there's a cigarette in mine.    
But we're doing things The Hitchcock Way, so bottoms up!    
All right.    
For those of you that don't know me, my name is Norm Scully.    
Hitchcock is my partner, and he's also my best friend.    
He buys the bear claws I like when we're on a stakeout or when we're just in the office or at home.    
I love him.    
Anna Rubov, do you promise to love and cherish    
Michael Hitchcock as much as I've loved him?    
I do.    
And, Michael Hitchcock, do you agree to shower Anna with the same love and kindness you've shown me these    wonderful years together?    
- I do.
- Dang.    



Terry didn't know this was gonna be so sweet.    
You may now kiss the bride.    
[cheers and applause]    
Hey, Rosa, good news.    
I just talked to someone who said he'd take all the guinea pigs.    
All    ? Why would he do that?    
I didn't ask. I just said yes.    
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Who is this guy?    
We gotta check him out, make sure he's not weird.    
He's just a normal guy who's a friend of Hitchcock's... yep, we gotta check him out.    
[background chatter, low music]    
Yeah, he's gonna turn them into toupees.    
Oh, my god, he is.    
The Hitchcock Way is exactly what we needed, you know?    
These last six months have actually been pretty hard.    
Mm, no!    
Hitchcock doesn't dwell on the past.    
Hitchcock forgets about the past because of the spots on his brain!    
Yes.    
To brain spots!    
[glasses clink]    
BOTH: Oh! Cinnamon schnapps!    
Barkeep, another round of drink roulette.    
Lieutenant, I never see you at Shaw's on a Sunday.    
Those nights are reserved for spending time with your family.    
I guess you do make... exceptions.    
What?    
The conversation we had six months ago?    
The one where you said you wouldn't make an exception for me.    
That was so long ago.    
A lot has happened since then.    
Well, to me it seems like mere minutes ago, because I've been living the same day over and over again.    
Gentlemen, would either of you mind giving some toasts?    
People are starting to notice we didn't serve any food.    
I have something I'd like to say.    
Marriage is amazing.    
To get to spend every day with the same person, day after day, month after month on repeat.    
The comfort of knowing that tomorrow will be just like today is truly a rewarding assignment.    
To Hitchcock!    
- Hear hear.
- [glass clinks]    
I'd also like to make a speech.    
Most marriages end in divorce, and there's a reason.    
It's boring to be stuck in the same routine forever.    
There's no value to be found in walking the same beat over and over, especially when you've been a captain for six years.    
The point is: marriage is a waste of my talents, Lieutenant.    
- To Hitchcock!
- These are great.    
- Really?
- I also have a toast to make.    
Hitchcock, I always thought I was better than you, because I haven't been divorced seven times and I've never been banned from a museum for kissing the statues.    
But today I realize that maybe my life would be better if I was more like you.    
Anyway, I gotta go make a baby of my own just like the baby inside of Anna.    
- [scattered gasps]
- [hands slap]    
- Nailed it.
- Thank you.    
Why is she saying these things, Anna?    
Okay, bud.    
Are you ready to have some stupid Hitchcock-style s*x?    
Oh, yeah, where are we going?    
Nowhere.    
We're going right here in Shaw's bathroom.    
Oh, that's such a bad idea.    
I love it.    
All right.    
Occupied!    
Someone's in there. Should we wait?    
Would Hitchcock wait?    
Hell no. Hitchcock would find an alley!    
Well, this is perfect.    
There's probably so many skunks skunking around here.    
Oh, yeah. We're gonna make a skunk baby.    
Yeah.    
- Hello.
- Huh?    
Don't worry about me.
I don't want to join.    
I'm happy just to watch.    
[shouting in Russian]    
Oh, crap; they're really pissed that Anna's pregnant.    
No, it's more complicated than that.    
Anna just called her entire family hypocrites.    
Wait, you speak Russian?    
Huh. I guess I do.    
I must have picked it up from speaking to that woman at the coffee cart for the past six months.    
[shouting in Russian]    
- Now what's happening?
- Anna's mother says    
Anna should be with someone respectable, like her sister's husband, Boris, instead of the...    
- Pig man.
- Well, that's too bad, 'cause she already married the pig man.    
[both shouting in Russian]    
What's she saying?    
She says that Boris is not a good man.    
He's cheating on her sister.    
She knows because he's the real father of her baby.    
- Oh.
- What?    
Oh, no!    
[door clicks, Amy gasps]    
Someone's here. This is too public!    
I mean, it wouldn't stop Hitchcock, but fine.    
I know a secret spot.    
[loud crash, both gasp]    
What was that?    
- What am I feeling right now?
- Huh?    
Are those all your little hands?    
[rodent teeth gnawing]    
[dramatic horror music, guinea pigs squeaking]    
[both scream]    
[dramatic horror music, guinea pigs squeaking]    
[both scream]    
And this is the last one.    
We've rounded up all the guinea pigs.    
Not even close.    
Guinea pig. Guinea pig.    
Guinea pig. Guinea pig. Guinea pig.    
What were you thinking, breeding guinea pigs at work?    
We weren't breeding them on purpose.    
They're just very sexual creatures, and we didn't want to slut-shame them.    
Yeah.    
Sorry you're not more sex-positive, Terry.    
I called my friend at the lab.    
He's gonna take the guinea pigs.    
They're not gonna do any chemical tests on them.    
They're just gonna teach them how to run mazes.    
Really? I want you to look Claire    in the eye, and tell her that...    
I'm sending you to a lab, Claire; bye.    
You can't do this!    
- This is so unfair, Terry!
- You're a cruel man!    
Thank God he found a way to end it.    
Oh, it's over. The nightmare's over.    
There you are.    
You didn't wake me up
when you left this morning.    
I tried. You said, ""I'm dead.
Leave me. Find someone new.""    
Yeah, pretty hungover.    
Look, last night wasn't great, but I think I know why.    
We were trying to do it like Hitchcock when we should have been trying to do it like Boris, the man who actually impregnated Hitchcock's wife.    
So I found him on Facebook and...    
Jake, stop.    
Why is it so easy    
for everyone else to get pregnant?    
I mean, look at these stupid guinea pigs.    
They made     babies, and we can't make one?    
Why can't we make     babies?    
You can't compare yourself to guinea pigs, babe.    
You taught me that.    
I'm exhausted.    
And the universe keeps telling us that it doesn't want us to have a baby.    
The message couldn't be clearer.    
So I'm done.    
Like, done for this month?    
Done. Just done.    
Thank you for seeing me.    
I just wanted to let you know I was wrong.    
Until last night, I didn't realize how much Russian I'd learned.    
Yeah, it was impressive.    
- And your accent was great, too.
- Thank you, but I actually speak with the accent of a peasant.    
Anyway, I walked my beat this morning, and I spoke to several people in Russian.    
They were so impressed, they opened up to me.    
- I got a number of useful tips.
- All right.    
All because I made you do something tedious.    
Monotonous. Don't ruin this.    
Thanks for coming out for Hitchcock's divorce party.    
You know you got another gay cake, right?    
What? No way.    
It says ""Boys! Boys! Boys!"" on it.    
Because we're the boys.    
Guys, I figured out what went wrong between Anna and me.    
My job. I'm a workaholic!    
Not anymore.    
From now on, I'm focusing on what really matters.    
Come on, Scully, let's get some wings.    
Aw, bud, I thought you'd never ask.    
Hey, want some cake?    
I got a piece with a heart on it, which I now realize is a butt.    
I'm good. Thanks.    
So listen.    
I've been thinking about what you said this morning...    
And it has been a really hard couple of months.    
I'm sorry I'm bad at making babies.    
Hey, hey, don't say that.    
It's not your fault.    
And look, for all we know, I could have...    
Don't say you have bum nards.    
I wasn't... I wasn't gonna.    
[scoffs] But...    
I think maybe it's just a thing we can't control.    
That is my least favorite kind of thing.    
I know.    
I really wanted to start a family.    
Amy, we are a family.    
You and me.    
So, you know, we can keep trying or look into IVF or adoption or if we want, we can forget about the whole thing.    
But if we're together, I'm happy no matter what.    
I don't know what I want to do.    
Fine. That's okay too.    
We don't have to have a plan.    
We make the rules.    
Maybe it would help to just not think about the whole thing for a while and see where we're at.    
Yeah, okay.    
I love you.    
I love you.    
Should we go?    
- Yes.
- Okay.    
Nope.    
[sighs]

What's this meeting about?  
Did someone find my meatball sub?  
A, we would never have a meeting about that.  
- B, you are holding it.
- Oh.  
[chuckles] Meeting adjourned.  
Meeting's not over, dummy.  
Terry said he had some news from the office  
- of Commissioner Wuntch.
- [groans]  
What does that human blister want now?   
Does she intend to demote me even further?   
Or perhaps she'll transfer me to the swamps of New Jersey so I can patrol the sinkhole where she was spawned.   
Or it's possible the announcement has nothing   
- to do with you.
- Oh, good thinking, Peralta.   
You're right.   
Maybe Madeline wants to inform us all that she's a Cheuksin.   
- A what?
- A Cheuksin.   
A Korean toilet ghost, lives in an outhouse, wraps her hair around your throat and chokes you to death   
- while you move your bowels.
- You know what?   
I will give you $ ,    if the announcement is she's a Cheuksin.   
Okay, everyone. I have some news.   
That Madeline Wuntch is a Korean toilet ghost?   
Boring. We already knew that.   
Madeline Wuntch is dead.   
Say what now?   
[upbeat music]   
♪   
- Wait, Wuntch is dead?
- Yeah.   
The Commissioner's office just notified us.   
No way that's true.   
As Wuntch says when she sees deodorant,   
- ""I'm not buying it.""
- [laughs]   
- Sir, she's dead.
- Oh, Terry.   
Zombies can't die.
This is some sort of scam.   
If she were dead, we would be hearing the sounds of children   
- singing in the streets.
- I don't know, sir.   
You didn't believe it when we told you the Disco Strangler died, either.   
And I was right. He was faking it.   
Maybe she's alive.   
Why would Wuntch fake her own death?   
The same reason she visits Mexico once a year and sucks the blood from all the goats.   
For kicks.   
Look, I don't know what to tell you, but she's dead. What do you want?   
To open up her coffin and check for yourself?   
Oh, she's very dead.   
Hello, gentlemen.   
Guess who's walking the red carpet this Saturday?   
- Chord Overstreet.
- Who?   
- Sam Evans from ""Glee.""
- No, me.   
Why would you guess that? I was clearly talking about me.   
Okay, but for the record, I bet Chord Overstreet will also be walking one.   
Stop talking about Chord Overstreet.   
No, I'm going to the world premiere of ""Kwazy Kupcakes: The Movie.""   
Whoa! How'd you get the invite?   
My buddy Mikey J. hooked me up.   
Oh, your ska friend?
Did he work on the movie?   
No, he submitted an unsolicited script that a producer accidentally opened   
so legally they had to give him a ""story by"" credit, and now I've got four tickets.   
Wow. So who you bringing?   
You know, Cagney and Lacey love ""Kwazy Kupcakes.""   
- They are crazy Kwazy fans.
- Huh, cool.   
Well, if you guys are free this Saturday...   
Stop, before you say anything you regret, you should know that ""Kwazy Kupcakes"" means a lot to Nikolaj.   
At the orphanage, that game was his only friend.   
Touching, but Cagney and Lacey don't have any friends at all.   
Maybe they can make some at this event.   
So what do you say, Jake?   
- Whose kids do you like more?
- What?   
Wait, wait, wait.
That's not what this is about.   
No, Boyle's right.
Whose kids do you like more?   
- Tell us now.
- Okay.   
You guys are being really intense.   
I like all of your kids an equal amount.   
Just give me some space and I'll figure out   
- who I'm gonna take.
- Okay, backing off.   
- Stepping away.
- Making room.   
- Letting you breathe.
- Thank you.   
[cell phone chimes]   
Did you both just send me pictures of your kids crying?   
BOTH: No.   
Ding, dong, the Wuntch is dead.   
Bagels for everyone!   
So I guess you believe it now.   
Yep. Wanna see the selfies I took?   
- Actually, yes.
- I'll share the album with you.    
Oh, my God!    
I just heard about Wuntch!    
She was so young!    
For a redwood tree.    
Uh, I don't understand what's going on.    
- Why are you crying?
- A person is dead.    
- I feel sad.
- That's insane.    
You don't feel sad when a monster dies in a monster movie.  
In ""E.T.,"" do you feel sad when E.T. dies?    
- Yes.
- He wasn't a monster.    
- He caused a real commotion.
- It isn't just Wuntch.    
I started seeing a fertility doctor and she has me taking hormones to help with ovulation and my emotions are in overdrive.    
Well, I know just the thing to cheer you up.    
Wuntch is dead! Bagel!    
Bagel! Bagel!    
Sir, I am loving this color on you, but don't you think you should tone it down?    
Why, in case I run into her family?    
I'm not planning any trips to the Bronx Zoo.    
Wait.    
Does this mean you're gonna be captain again?    
It does.    
The Chief of Personnel called to say the promotion is in the works.    
Her death means I've won.    
It's finally over.    
[cell phone chimes]    
An email from Madeline Wuntch?    
Subject line, ""It's not over.""    
My friends, I have a proclamation to bestow upon ye.    
Why are you talking like that?    
And why'd you have us come in here?    
Is this about the tickets?    
It is indeed about said tickets, and said proclamation about said tickets is in fact...    
Jake, just tell us.
No one is liking this.    
I'm loving it. You sound so smart.    
Oh, thank you, my loyal subject Charles.    
Now, as you know, this decision has been quite hard upon me... title of mine s*x tape... but I have made it at long last,  and it is my decree that the recipient shall be...    
- Both of you.
- What?    
Did you talk to Mikey J. and get more tickets?    
Indeed I did not, but it is my decision that I will cut all of said tickets    
- in twain.
- Twain?    
Terry doesn't want a twained ticket to ""Kwazy Kupcakes.""    
That's not how tickets work.    
- You'd just be ruining them.
- None of us would get in.    
- Are you dumb?
- No!    
All right, full disclosure.    
I was trying to do that Bible thing and then one of you was gonna take the high road and say that rather than see the tickets destroyed, you would just bow out, and then that person
was gonna get the tickets.    
Nope.    
If I don't get them, no one does.    
Agreed. Boyles or bust.    
- Cut them up.
- I'm not gonna do that.    
I'm just gonna have to think of another way to figure this out.    
Stupid Bible with stupid lessons never solved crap!    
So you were right.    
Wuntch was not able to claw through her coffin and write the email herself.    
It turns out, the lawyer for her estate sent it.    
I wish I had taken the LSATs.    
Not to be a lawyer.
Just seems like a fun test.    
- Dude, you're bumming us out.
- All right.    
Uh, the email contains a link to a video.    
I'm going to play it. Brace yourselves.    
If it shows Madeline, be sure not to look directly into her eyes.    
- Because we'll turn to stone?
- No.    
Because her eyes are ugly.    
Hello, Raymond. Surprised to see me? 
Well, I didn't say Bloody Mary three times,    
- so yes.
- When did she record this?    
Judging by the flames around her,    
- it could be a livestream.
- [laughs]    
Very good, Rosa. [laughs]    
I'm sure you consider my untimely death a victory, 
but I'd never let you win. 
I told everyone that in my final days, 
we reconciled and you insisted on hosting and organizing 
my NYPD memorial service. 
I know you won't be able to resist badmouthing me 
at the service. 
All the top brass will be there, 
and when you speak ill of me, 
it will end your career. 
It's over. I won. 
Bye, Raymond. 
Oh, no. I'm doomed.    
Seriously?    
All you have to do is not insult a dead woman    
- at her own memorial service.
- Exactly.    
It's impossible.    
Oh, you must be feeling better.    
You're heating up your favorite meal; beans.    
They're refried.    
It's bad enough they were cooked once, let alone twice, and now the toaster oven makes it three times.    
I couldn't be crying for help any louder.    
So I take it you couldn't get out of organizing Wuntch's memorial.    
Oh, no. It's impossible.    
She has bested me yet again.    
Well then stop being such a moron, you idiot.    
- Amy!
- Sorry, it's the hormones.    
They're making me really irritable.    
Angry Amy's right.    
All you have to do is say a few nice comments    
- during the memorial.
- As God said when Wuntch tried to sneak past the gates into heaven,    
- ""It ain't happening, honey.""
- [laughs]    
I tried to write a kind speech about her last night,    
- and this is what came out.
- Oh.    
It's, like,    pages long.    
- Why is it in all caps?
- So I remember to yell it.    
Oh, well, you obviously can't read any of this.    
Look, since you can't say anything nice, try saying the opposite of whatever you're thinking.    
Interesting.    
I'll give it a whirl.    
Madeline Wuntch was...    
- A friend.
- See?    
It's not that hard to say something ni...    
- Oh, you're vomiting.
- [gagging]    
Hi, Jake. It's me, Nikolaj.    
Hey, bud. What are you doing here?
It's Thursday.    
Shouldn't you be at tailoring class?    
I want to say thank you.    
Dad said that you were giving us tickets to the ""Kwazy Kupcakes"" movie.    
Oh, he did, did he?
Excuse me one second.    
- Of all the twisted moves!
- Don't hate the player.    
Go ahead. Tell Niko he's not going.    
- I dare you.
- [snarls]    
[laughs] Hey, listen.    
[clears throat]    
Niko, there's something I gotta tell you.    
BOTH: Uncle Jake! Uncle Jake!    
Slow down, girls. No need to run.    
Uncle Jake is family.    
Now, what do you wanna say to Uncle Jake?    
BOTH: Thank you for the tickets.    
Oh, that's so cute how you said that at the same time without rehearsing it in the car.    
It sure is. Hey, Terry, Charles, can I speak with you in the break room for a moment?    
Uh, hey, kids, look at this.    
Pimping out your kids?    
I hate to say this, but you two are acting like bad dads, and I should know.    
One time my father forgot to pick me up from school    
'cause he was having s*x with my best friend's mom.    
Oh, my God. That's terrible.    
Yeah. I was   .    
I just walked to the mall and watched ""Empire Records"" by myself, but the point is, you're both acting ridiculous.    
No, this is on you, Jake.    
- You need to make a choice.
- That's not fair.    
You both want to go and I don't want to hurt either of you.    
But maybe I don't have to.    
I can let fate hurt you.
We'll flip a coin.    
Terry, call it in the air.
Heads or tails.    
[grunts] Neither.    
Oh, my God.    
Did you just fold my quarter in half?    
Fate's a bitch.    
You make the choice.    
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.    
Just so you know, I would never bend your money.    
- Yeah, 'cause you can't.
- Correct, I cannot.    
No one can. How did he do that?    
Now these fertility drugs are making me sweat.    
- Is it noticeable?
- No.    
- Yes.
- Oh.    
I thought we were gonna lie to her because it's so upsetting to look at.    
Just tell me what room the memorial is in.    
We don't have a lot of time to set up.    
About that.    
Yesterday before you convinced me to hold a respectful service, I sent some instructions for how I wanted the room to look.    
We may need to make some tweaks.    
[shocking music]    
- So many balloon arches.
- I know.    
It all has to go. Okay!    
Everyone, we have work to do.    
- [organ music]
- _    
- Better?
- Much.    
But to be clear, the first version was dope and you have my respect for life.    
Excuse me.    
Is this the memorial for Madeline Wuntch?    
Yes, this is the memorial for Madeline Wuntch.    
Just saying her name brings tears to my eyes.    
Why, because her heart was made of onions?    
Excuse me?    
Madeline Wuntch was what you get when you cross a slug with an a**l fissure.    
We spent our entire lives trying to destroy each other.    
I was her one true nemesis.    
♪    
No.    
Hey there, Jake.    
I felt bad about folding your quarter in half, so I got you a new one.    
Thank you. But that's not a quarter.    
Wow, you're right.    
That happens to be an         
Carson City silver dollar in near-mint condition complete with commemorative case.    
[whistles]    
That's gotta be worth $   .    
You know what? Keep it.    
Shame.    
Shame, Terrence Jeffords, shame!    
You probably didn't realize this, Jake, but the lieutenant over here is trying to bribe you.    
Yeah, I don't think he's hiding that.    
- I am not.
- Well, neither am I.    
Here's a check for $   .    
Another silver dollar.    
Ooh, looks like I'm up to    .    
Well, here's a second check for $  .    
- I am up one dollar.
- Four more.    
How many silver dollars do you have?    
As many as it takes.    
Well, this checkbook is only on    ,    
so I can write checks all day long.    
Well, you know what? Here's my watch.    
- Yeah, melt this down.
- Enough!    
I'm tired of being stuck in the middle of this.    
You figure out who gets the tickets and tell me.    
That should keep them busy for a little while.    
Hey, Jake, we've decided how to settle this.    
We're gonna duke it out in the ring.    
What?    
That man is lying.    
I don't believe Wuntch had another rival.    
I saw it in her eyes.    
She only had hate for me.    
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I am.    
I despised her with my entire being while she was only despising me with a fraction of hers?    
Sir, you were doing so well, okay?    
Don't let this rattle you.    
Are you wearing sponges in your armpits?    
If you have a better way to soak up sweat, I would like to hear it.    
Where are you going?    
To find out if there was another man.    
[organ music]    
- So, um, Adam is it?
- Mm-hmm.    
I only ask because Madeline never mentioned you.    
Interesting, 'cause she mentioned you to me,    
- as a friend.
- Friend?    
- Mm.
- I think you added an ""R""    
- to the word ""fiend.""
- No, I'm sure it was friend.    
I mean, based on context alone,    
I wouldn't say somebody was one of my closest fiends.    
Oh, you might.    
We had a very contentious relationship.    
She never forgave me for embarrassing her in front of Derek Jeter.    
Well, I embarrassed her in front of A-Rod and J.Lo together.    
For    years I replaced her anti-wrinkle cream with sour cream.    
I replaced her Lactaid pills with Tic Tacs.    
Dead moron was crapping her pants for months.    
She hacked into my Netflix account and watched the ""Lizzie McGuire"" movie on repeat to ruin my algorithm.    
She made me guard that doctor who came back to New York with Ebola.    
Sir, maybe you want to keep it down.    
- There's people...
- That witch ruined my life!    
She demoted me from captain to uniformed officer.    
Eight years ago she had me kicked off the force entirely.    
You were not her greatest rival, and the proof is right here.    
Hello, Adam. 
I may be dying 
but I burned down your cabin in Maine. 
You were my one true rival. 
There you have it.    
[dramatic music]    
I meant nothing to her.    
That cockroach Madeline was two-timing me!    
No sign of Holt anywhere.    
I know that's important, but I don't think I can just breeze past the outfit, ""Sister Act.""    
I sweat through my clothes and I found this in the back of a closet, okay?    
- Deal with it.
- You look great.    
Oh, there he is. Sir, over here.    
Where are you?    
Why are you holding the mean yelling speech?    
Because I'm gonna yell it, meanly.    
I wasted half my life hating that duplicitous hag, and she didn't even have the decency to truly hate me back.    
Well, screw her.    
- I'm gonna ruin her memorial.
- No, you can't do that.    
If you read that speech, you'll be fired.    
You're right.    
And that would ruin my career.    
And it's worth it.    
I'm giving the speech.    
No, that's what Wuntch wanted.    
- You're letting her win.
- Sweaty Amy's right.    



If you really wanna get back at her, you'll team up with Adam and give her a nice funeral.    
It's like "" The Durrells of Corfu"" when Prudence and Louisa joined forces...    
To sink the catamaran of the bookseller Yorgos who wronged them both. Yes!    
I will team up with Adam.    
Wow.    
[laughs] For a moment there,    
I almost forgot who the real villain was.    
- The woman who recently died.
- Mm.    
Charles, why did you let Terry choose boxing?    
He didn't. I picked it.    
- But you'll die.
- Don't worry about it.    
Boxing's in my blood.    
My Nana Boyle boxed in the Navy.    
I'm sure she did but... and hear me out... what if you're not as strong as your Nana Boyle?    
I can handle myself.    
She taught me her signature punch;    
- the Strawberry Basket.
- That does not reassure me.    
Hey there, big guy.    
You sure you're feeling okay about ending Charles's life?    
Yep, my girls are gonna see this movie.    
Right, well, before you commit manslaughter,    
I do feel compelled to tell you that the movie only has a    on Rotten Tomatoes.    
Jake, stop yapping and let them fight.    
I wanna see the big guy pop the little guy's head off.    
Yeah, let's start the fight!    
I wanna pop that little guy's head off!    
You're clearly the little guy.    
[laughs] Good one, Jake.    
All right. I guess this is happening.    
Touch gloves.    
[exciting music]    
Charles, it's been very nice being your friend.    
Terry, I'll visit you in prison.    
- And...
- [bell ringing]    
- Fight.
- Strawberry basket!    
- [blow lands]
- [groans]    
Whoo, yeah!    
You mess with Grandma, you're gonna get the basket!    
Charles, you punched him in the nards.    
Yeah, Nana fought nasty.    
Now if you don't mind, I'd like those tickets.    
I didn't hear no bell! [shouts]    
[grunts]    
Jake, I think those tickets are mine.    
- Strawberry basket!
- [groans]    
Guys, stop! It's a movie about cupcakes!    
- You don't understand!
- You don't have kids!    
[crying]    
Wow, that speech would have been amazing.    
I had to look up what a toilet ghost was.    
Uh, yes, I took a trip to Korea just to research a new Wuntch insult.    
In fact it's been a motivation for most of my international travel.    
- Mm.
- So you guys are friends now?    
Uh, yes, it seems we have a great deal in common.    
Well, one thing.    
BOTH: Hating Wuntch. [both laughing]    
I read him the obituary I wrote for her, but the ""Times"" wouldn't publish it.    
It had too many obscenities.    
And I read him my all caps speech.    
And I loved it. It was like poetry.    
Madeline smelled like dog crap.    
Raymond convinced me the best way to get back at Wuntch is to make sure he doesn't get fired.    
Also I'm just gonna chisel a pen1s onto her headstone.    
And I'm gonna watch.    
- [both laughing]
- Please take your seats.    
Well, uh, time for me to go make a tear-jerker of a speech.    
Hey, I thought of the best hashtag to post with my photo of the grave pen1s.    
I'm not on board with that friendship.    
Yeah, there's something weird about that guy.    
Hey, when did he say he got kicked off the force?    
- Eight years ago.
- That doesn't add up.    
He said Wuntch sent him to guard the Ebola doctor.    
- Wasn't that six years ago?
- Yeah.    
Oh, my God.    
Wuntch sent him to destroy Holt.    
Good afternoon.    
On this sad day, I'd like to say a few words about Commissioner Wuntch.    
Madeline smelled like dog crap.    
I'm sorry.    
I... I don't know what...    
From a sick dog. [laughs]    
Adam, what are you doing?    
I'm showing everyone your true colors, Raymond Holt.    
Enjoy the show, people!    
Madeline Wuntch will not soon be forgotten.    
Trick or Treaters will dress like her for generations.    
- Hey!
- Diaz, delete all the videos.    
- [glass cracking]
- Deleted.    
- It's over.
- Yeah, for you.    
Everyone who's anyone in NYPD just saw you for your true self.    
- Your career is ruined, Ray-Ray.
- Who are you?    
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm Madeline Wuntch's nephew.    
She sent me here to carry out the final phase of her master plan, and now it's all over.
Wait, why are you smiling?    
Because, Adam, this isn't the real memorial.    
- It's all a ruse.
- What?    
Yeah, what?    
I knew Wuntch had one final trick up her sleeve.    
I didn't know what it was, so I had to be prepared for anything.    
This whole thing was staged.    
None of these people are real mourners.    
They're not even in the NYPD.    
- You hired actors?
- Worse.    
They're members of local improv troupes, and they did it for ""the exposure.""    
This has been a blast, but we have to go start a flash mob at the Freedom Tower.    
Oh, check out our YouTube channel.    
No. Sit down.    
I have to hand it to you, Adam.    
You almost fooled me, but no other man could possibly have what Wuntch and I had.    
We were star-crossed haters.    
Whatever.    
I still inherit half her estate    
- just for trying this.
- Cool.    
Who gets the other half of every child's nightmares?    
I love it, Rosa. Great work all day.    
So how are you two feeling after your little boxing match?    
- My head hurts.
- I can't feel my strawberries.    
I meant more emotionally and less groinally, but listen, ever since I brought these tickets up, you guys have made my life absolutely miserable, but that ends now, because I've made a choice.    
Cagney is sick.
We don't know how long she has.    
We do know for Nikolaj. It's    hours.    
Just stop, all right? Stop lying.    
This is exactly the type of behavior that has led me to decide that I'm not taking either of you.    
Seriously? Oh, man.    
The kids are gonna be so disappointed.    
No, they won't, because they're going.    
That's right, I'm bringing all three of them by myself and you two don't get to go.    
Your childish behavior has led you to miss out on the most exciting movie premiere event in the state of New York this Saturday.    
I hope you've learned your lesson.    
Good day.    
[sighs]    
Wait. He's taking the kids for us?    
It's just like getting a free babysitter.    
This is incredible.    
People without kids are so stupid.    
- They're gonna destroy him.
- Yeah.    
So just to be clear, this service is actually real, right?    
Oh, yes. I figured if I needed two fake memorials to smoke out Wuntch's plan, she deserved to win, but she didn't win. I did.    
Finally beat the old fishwife.    
It's crazy.    
After today you never have to think about Madeline Wuntch again.    
Yes, I suppose you're right.    
Sir, does that make you sad?    
I don't know.    
I think maybe...    
Yes?    
Well, I think it's natural to feel a little down about her death.    
For the last    years, your lives have been entangled.    
Because of her ratty hair.    
No, it's not the same.    
Now it just feels like I'm insulting    
- a helpless dead person.
- You are.    
It's what you've been doing all week.    
Yeah, it's been tight.    
[organ music]    
Well, it's time for my speech.    
- Sir, what are you gonna say?
- I don't know.    
Maybe I'll just be honest.    
♪    
Did he say he was gonna be honest?    
Yeah, this is gonna be bad.    
As many of you know,    
Madeline and I were bitter rivals, but I've come to realize she held a special place in my life.    
No one challenged me like she did or made me feel as alive.    
Our relationship was like an epic chess match.    
And it's hard to believe that...    
- She'll never make another move.
- [phone chimes]    
Unless...    
No, it's just a notification.    
Cheddar's doggy toothpaste has shipped.    
So she is gone, and I wish she were not.    
I will miss you, Madeline Wuntch.    
[groans] Wario, why are you like this?    
Hey, so I don't know if you noticed, but ever since I started those hormone treatments...    
I didn't notice anything.    
You said that way too quick.    
I mean, you did cry at that one car commercial and it wasn't even an emotional one.    
- It was about towing capacity.
- Yeah.    
Well, I called the doctor to see if that was a common side effect and apparently, it isn't.    
Oh, no.    
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.    
She did have one guess as to what might be causing it.    
And, um, she was right.    
[exhales]    
Ames.    
- Are we having a baby?
- We're having a baby.    
- [laughs]
- [exhales]

It happened!

Peralta, you need to come with me right now.  
Can I eat my bagel?  
Trust me, you're not gonna wanna eat before you see this.  
That's Shane Reed.
Suspect in a string of B&Es.  
Got pulled over this morning.
This was in his trunk.  
Son of a bitch!  
Peralta... Peralta, calm down.  
Why am I here? I didn't do anything.  
You broke into    houses, Shane, but that's not what I care about right now.   
All I care about is what we found in your car.   
- I don't understand.
- He doesn't understand, Diaz.   
Why don't you fill him in?   
""You are invited to celebrate the wedding of Katherine Joyner and Douglas Judy.""   
Douglas Judy, AKA Doug Judy, AKA, the Pontiac Bandit.   
- Maybe.
- That's a yes.   
Now tell me, Shane, when did you get the invite?   
What?   
When did you receive the invite in the mail and how come I didn't get one?   
Why would you get an invite?
Do you know Doug?   
Hey, I'm the one asking the questions here!   
Calm down, Jake.
Maybe it's a small wedding.   
Okay, good point.
How big is the venue, Shane?   
- I said how big is the venue?
- I... I... I don't know!   
I... I... I... I don't know!
But I bet you do know the password to the wedding website, don't you?   
Yeah, I guess.   
Well, then I guess you better tell it to me, Shane.   
You wash my back, I'll wash yours.   
- Wash?
- I meant scratch.   
You know I meant scratch.
Now tell me the password.   
I think it's ""dougandkateforever.""   
There, was that so hard, Shane?   
You did the right thing.   
Now get this piece of trash out of my sight.   
Oh, is forever spelled out, or is it the number four?   
- Oh, it's spelled out.
- Okay, thank you so much.   
Now get this piece of trash out of my sight!   
I'm so glad you called.   
Thanks for meeting me at my favorite establishment.   
A place where you paint pottery?   
I find a hand-painted mug makes a thoughtful gift for any occasion.   
So, what's going on?
Anything exciting in your life   
that you maybe want to tell me about?   
I got a new job. I sit behind white CEOs when they have to testify before Congress, so they don't look so racist.   
Every    minutes I just whisper some nonsense at 'em.   
The texture of quiche is unsettling.   
I got paid $  ,    for that nonsense.   
That's cool, congratulations.
But there's nothing else, you know, maybe even more interesting that you want to fill me in on?   
It seemed like a pretty cool fact to me.   
All right, look, Judy, I know you're getting married.   
Damn it, I didn't think you'd find out about that.   
Who told you, Ronnie? Bobby?   
Ricky? Mike?   
Don't try and change the subject by tricking me   
into singing New Edition with you.   
I don't know what you're talking about.   
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike...   
♪ If I like the girl who cares who you like ♪   
- Whoo!
- So all is forgiven?   
No! Why didn't you invite me?   
I wanted to, but a lot of people in my life are crooks and they think it's weird that I'm friends with a cop.   
They just don't understand.
Kind of like... parents?   
No, no more songs.   
Look, I'm having my Bachelor party tomorrow night and I want you to be there.
We'll make up a criminal alias for you so you can meet the boys.   
Obviously that's a super cool plan, but no, I don't want your pity.   
Suit yourself, but it's gonna be one sexy-ass weekend.

How sexy-ass are we talking here?   
- Private jet to Miami, baby!
- And there's a red carpet!   
Forget the red carpet. Private jet!   
Yes, and a jet! The jet is better.   
- Miami, here we come!
- Whoo!   
Today is Holt's first day back in his office and I wanna make sure everything is just how he left it.   
Now, I can't remember, was this little figurine of Cheddar at a    or    degree angle?   
Terry, it's a five degree difference.   
You better figure it out.   
Ah, I missed this place.   
Huh, little Cheddar's askew.   
You really made yourself at home, didn't you Jeffords?   
But, uh... no matter.   
Just glad to be here.   
I am a captain again.
Back where I belong.    
Everything is perfect.    
Wow... there's absolutely nothing that could puncture my...    
- where's the business card?
- What?    
The business card that was right here.    
It had a piece of gum on it.
It's very important to me.    
You didn't throw it away, did you?    
No, Terry would never throw away something that looked exactly like trash.    
Good. I'll be back in half an hour.    
Make sure it's on my desk by then.    
Will do, sir. I got it.    
I'm on it.    
I definitely threw it away.    
I want you to meet the guys.    
This is Nathan, Josh, and Chuck.    
This is my buddy, Sean, from prison.    
How's it going, fellas?    
I've never heard you mention Sean before.    
Yeah, well like he said, I just got out of jail.    
Five years.    
Tough sentence. What'd you do?    
Elder abuse. Got my grandpa good, so...    
Damn, that's very upsetting.    
Damn straight it is.    
Elder abuse?    
I was trying to think of something that wouldn't inspire any follow-up questions.    
Doug Judy!    
Cubes! My man.    
Sean, I'd like you to meet the man whose private jet we are flying on today.    
Yeah, you're Mark Cuban.    
How do you guys know each other?    
Doug came on ""Shark Tank"" to pitch his idea for the Smush Shush.    
It's a noise-cancelling blanket for secret s*x.    
The product demonstration did not go well.    
Robert fainted. Anyway, enjoy the jet.    
Just bring it back in one piece, okay?    
No promises, Mark Cuban.    
I mean, we do wanna make sure the airplane stays in one piece though, right?    
Nah, I saw, ""Flight."" If anything goes wrong, fly the plane upside down.    
Oh, right, I forgot about ""Flight,"" the movie, ""Flight.""    
All right, let's rip it up!    
- What's going on here?
- Oh, measuring the space.    
We finally got a work order approved to fix the outlet, so...  we can get a third vending machine.    
What?    
A third vending machine.    
Why are you whispering about getting a new vending machine?    
- New vending machine!
- What model number?    
Oh, that's why.    
We asked you what model number.    
I don't know, a normal one with glass in the front.    
Seriously? Did you even look into the DiGiSnax    E?    
I'd be into a fancy machine, too.    
I was just reading about a Japanese one that serves shellfish.    
We're not getting a shellfish machine.    
Yeah, Boyle, we're getting a smart machine that suggests soda pairings based on your chip choice.    
Or one with a make-it-wet gravy feature!    
Okay, look.
Why don't you get a few options together and then I'll decide, okay?    
At least Terry's not here to try to make me get a yogurt machine.    
What was that about yogurt?    
This jet is insane. 
There's a private chef that'll make anything you ask for, no matter how expensive.    
I just ordered lobster enchanté.    
- Oh, damn, what's that?
- I don't know.    
I just said the fanciest words I could think of.    
Oh, I'm gonna get the Veal Prime Minister.    
Mm, that sounds good.    
Hey, you wanna try out the Smush Shush?    
What? You have one with you?    
- I take it everywhere, baby.
- Yeah, there it is.    
- Yeah.
- So it's noise canceling?    
It's so heavy. It's crushing my bones.    
Yeah, that was the Shark's problem with it, too.    
I can't breathe. Get it off me.    
Get it off me.    
Yeah, you sound exactly like Barbara right now.    
Disappointed in you, Jake.    
Pilot says we're starting our descent.    
- Then let's get changed, boys!
- Changed?    
But these are my coolest clothes.    
I got them from a targeted Instagram ad  after looking at photos of Cam Newton.    
The outfit's beautiful, but it doesn't really say, ""Miami.""    
What does say, ""Miami?""

Nope, I was a real sweet pea, so they let me out for good behavior. What the hell?

Yeah, they're all suspicious now.    
You have to help us convince them that Jake's not a cop.    
Why? I don't understand why you invited him.    
This was supposed to be a crazy weekend of boobs and butts.    
Trudy Judy, you're not gonna see boobs or butts this weekend.    
I'll see butts if I wanna see butts.    
And Jake is here because he's my friend and he really wanted to come.    
No, he's up to something.    
He's probably here to arrest Chuck.    
I would never arrest Chuck... but, I mean, why'd you say that? What did Chuck do?    
Wow... cops always be copping.    
That's not true. I do bad things.    
One time I illegally downloaded an O-Town album!    
Dang, that's one of the hardest boy bands.    
Exactly, they're scary.
Look, I can be cool.    
As long as nobody commits any major crimes in front of me.    
It's not a problem. We don't have to break the law to have fun.    
We gonna have some drinks, smoke some Cubans, eat a steak, either crazy big or crazy small, whichever's more expensive.    
I'd rather see butts.    
Fine, if I let you see butts, will you convince the guys that Jake's not a cop?    
How many butts are we talking?    
- Six.
- Ten.    
- Seven.
- Nine.    
Fine, eight, I'll meet you in the middle.    
Nah, you waited too long.
Now it's up to   .    
-    butts!
- She's a grown woman.    
- Just let her see butts, man.
- Thank you, Jake.    
Thank you for coming to my aid on the butt thing.    
One step closer to trust.
Now I'ma go out there and help your fedora-wearing Jason Mraz-looking ass, okay?    
I think I look like Andy Garcia in this hat.    
- You look like Seth Green.
- Seth Green?    
- No, Tom Green.
- Tom Green.    
- You're thinking of Tom Green.
- Tom Green?    
No, go back to Jason Mraz.    
Okay, so Holt's gum-covered business card is long gone.    
But I have a plan.    
Great, what's the scheme?    
Well, when I first moved in, I took a couple selfies to commemorate getting my own office.    
- A couple?
- Oh, please.    
Like you don't have any selfies.    
Let me see your camera roll.    
Zero photos? That's so much weirder!    
- Thank you.
- Anyway, look.    
If you zoom in enough, you can see the business card.    
We can recreate it and print a new one!    
Wait, does that say ""Zeff Wilcox""?    
Zeff? No, it's probably Jeff.    
You know, like a normal human name.    
Names are all made up.    
There's no such thing as a normal name.    
""Terry.""    
I am not putting ""Zeff"" on that card.    
It's your funeral.    
Have you found my business card?    
Uh... you know what,    
I actually brought it home by accident.    
I got confused because I know someone with that name.    
You know another Zeff?    
Yeah, he's married to Sharon's friend, Zudy.    
We have dinner with Zeff and Zudy once a month.    
You know, I'm gonna go home and get it.    
Excuse me.    
I think they swing.    
So in the end, it's more than a vending machine.    
It's a vending experience.    
A vending experience that serves fried octopus balls?    
It also serves eel balls and clam balls and... it's really just the three kinds of balls.    
Oh, okay. On that horrifying note, Scully and Hitchcock, it's your turn.    
Allow me to introduce you to the Q    .    
She's got it all. Chips, candy, soda, and a whole lot of class.    
That sounds great for snacking, but what if I'm stuck working late at the office?    
How about a personal-sized frozen pizza?    
And then what? I have to carry it all the way over to the microwave on my own?    
Who has the time?    
Well, you're in luck, because...    
I get it! It cooks the pizza for you.    
It cooks the pizza for you.

No applause? Wow.    
I'm still just a little confused.    
Who is Sean, really?    
Why'd your sister say he was a NARC?    
- Is he a cop?
- He's not a cop.    
He caught me cheating on my boyfriend and he snitched.    
It was a real dick move, but I have since forgiven him.    
It's just weird that none of us  have ever heard of him before.    
And we're paranoid because Doug still has that cop friend in the NYPD.    
- That dude is not my friend.
- Yeah.    
- He dumb as hell.
- Yeah.    
- I'm always tricking him.
- Well, not every time.    
- Plus, he's short.
- Everyone's short to you.    
- You're a giant.
- Probably never even had s*x.    
Seems unlikely. He's an adult.    
But the point is, I'm Sean. Tall Sean.    
Okay, well I'm glad to hear you're not a NARC,    
'cause it'd have been real awkward considering what we did earlier.    
Huh?    
While you were checking in, we stole $   million  worth of diamonds from that rich Russian dude in the penthouse!    
Bling, bling, baby!    
You idiots. He's NYPD.    
That's Doug's cop friend.    
Wow... way to ruin Doug's bachelor party, Trudy.    
What a buzz kill, right, guys?    
I knew it was a mistake to invite a cop.    
That's why you should only interact with people who are exactly the same as you.    
That's a terrible lesson.    
Sometimes things aren't lessons.    
Sometimes things are just messed up facts.    
Guys, relax, Jake wasn't gonna arrest anybody.    
- No, I definitely was.
- With what evidence?    
The diamonds aren't even here.    
They confessed right in front of me.    
Why would you pull a heist in the middle of my bachelor party?    
You pulled a heist during my wedding.    
Shh... he's a cop, man. Come on, chill.    
- Judy.
- Come on, guys.    
What are we gonna do?    
I say we tie this NARC up, leave him to starve, and disappear with the diamonds.    
- Chuck.
- We're not doing that.    
- Thank you.
- It'll ruin my bachelor party.    
That's your issue with it?    
I put a lot of work into this weekend.    
I got us all shirts that say, ""Doug's Dudes.""    
Ooh.    
Sorry, but what's done is done.    
It's not like we can put the diamonds back.    
Hold up, that's a great idea.    
We pull a reverse heist.    
Does the Russian know his diamonds are missing?    
No, we swapped them for fakes.    
Perfect, that means he hasn't reported it.    
- No harm, no foul.
- Okay, wait.    
I mean, obviously I love the premise and I think a reverse heist would make for a great movie and I already have the tag line, ""This summer there are takebacks.""    
Love that.    
The poster would be you and me back-to-back with our arms crossed, but no, I'm not onboard with this.    
I'm a cop.    
And a cop's job is to prevent crime and that's what you'd be doing.    
Please, Jake. For me?    
Okay, fine. 'Cause it's your bachelor party and only if I see them put back with my own eyes.    
Yes! Deal. Reverse heist, baby.    
The Takeback. Coming this fall to HBO.    
It's a TV show now?    
Well that's where all the best content is.    
So what do you think?    
Which gum looks the most like the one from the picture?    
Two pink, too wet, too small, too chewed, too smooth, too wet, all wrong, too pink, too fresh, too dirty, too clean.    
None of these work. You struck out.    
We don't have any time. What do we do?    
I don't know. Pick one and pray.    
Uh... I'm gonna go with... you.    
Not that one.    
This one.    
Hmm... it's a little less pink than I recall.    
But I suppose we exaggerate the beauty of those we love.    
It's good to have you back, old friend.    
Can I ask why that card is so important?    
Because of Zeff Wilcox.    
He was a victim in the first case I worked.    
- I always want to remember him.
- That's nice.    
And the words he wrote on the back.    
The back... say what, now?    
Why is this blank?    
I threw it away. I thought it was trash.    
I didn't know you kept it to remember someone you helped.    
I didn't help Zeff, I failed Zeff.    
His case was never solved.    
The words written on the back were:    
""Thanks for nothing.""    
Oh, man, that's rough.    
I have held onto that card for    years because I always wanted to remember what it felt like to let someone down, so I'd never do it again.    
That card made me the cop I am today.    
Without it... I'm lost.    
Since this seems important now, I want to be clear.    
This is Terry's thing, I've just been along for the ride.    
- Rosa!
- Noted.    
So tell us how you stole the diamonds, so we can just reverse it.    
Won't work.
We took them from the luggage downstairs, posing as bellhops.    
It was a one-time opportunity.    
And now the fakes are locked in the safe in a bodyguard-protected suite.    
Well lucky for you, I have a long past in heist planning.    
It's how I proposed to my wife.    



That's a great story.
Makes me cry every time.    
Oh, thank you.
Well, I guess I'll tell it.    
You see, once a year, at Halloween...    
I can tell that I'm losing the room.    
I'll just move on.    
So here's how our thing is gonna go.    
Every hotel safe has an override code, 
in case guests leave them locked. 
That code is kept on the concierge's computer. 
Do you know who this is?    
This is Matt Daniel, the most popular male ASMR performer on Twitch.    
- ASMR performer?
- Someone who speaks real soft.    
I also crinkle paper.    
We're trying to stream and the noise on the eighth floor is unacceptable.    
My fans can't hear my mouth sounds.    
I'm so sorry, I can't hear you.    
That's the point, Georgina.    
He says that's the point, Georgina.    
This is taking too long. Make a video.    
Tell your    million subscribers to never stay at this crap hotel.    
No, no, no. I'll take care of it.    
Let me talk to my general manager.    
- You better run.
- Matt, don't yell.    
You'll strain your beautiful voice.    
Once we hack into the computer 
and get the override code, 
Trudy will put on a housekeeper's uniform 
and I will gracefully hide in her cart. 
I got it myself.    
Then, after the Russian goes out for the night, 
Trudy will show up for turn-down service 
and I sneak out when the guards are distracted by 
Trudy's signature sexy housekeeping. 
Trudy will then exit, leaving me behind in the suite 
so I can unlock the balcony door for Chuck and Doug, 
who are waiting outside on the window washer's rig. 
Chuck will bring the stolen diamonds and I'll use 
the override code to put them back where they belong. 
Then, we head down to the room where we party like hell. 
Trudy Judy...    
It's exactly   , just like you promised.    
- You did promise her butts.
- I know.    
Mmm... the smell of fresh cooked pizza.    
Where are we? Rome, Italy?    
Guys, you got the vending machine you wanted.    
You can stop with the play acting.    
I don't think that's scripted.    
That's just them talking about pizza.    
Yum, yum, yum.    
I shouldn't have pushed for the fish ball machine.    
I should've just played it safe and gone for the fish cake machine.    
So you don't think the fish part was the problem?    
- I don't.
- Well, at least they're happy.    
Look at 'em.    
My pizza!    
You did it, Peralta. 
You pulled off the reverse heist.    
This whole time I thought you were a bitch... but truth is, you're actually that bitch!    
He is, isn't he? He's that bitch.    
I don't know if I want that nickname to stick.    
Ooh, I hope my butts are back.    
I do not like how butts have become your thing, Trudy.    
- You used to love horses.
- Horses have butts.    
Guys, it's not butts.    
I'm so sorry, Doug.    
Miami PD!    
It's just those three back there.    
Hand on the table.    
Jake, what the hell?    
Cops always be copping.    
Hey! Hey there, friends.    
I tried to flag down your taxi as you were leaving the police station.    
It was actually funny, 'cause we made a lot of eye contact, but you just drove off.    
Anyways, I'm here now. We can go.    
You want us to take you back to New York after you got my friends arrested?    
Nuh-uh, you flying commercial, son.    
I hope you get a middle seat.    
I hope they charge you for your carry-ons.    
I hope you sit next to someone chatty.    
Someone going through something real hard.    
I hope the pilot makes an announcement during the emotional climax of the movie you're watching.    
- Ooh, you nasty!
- Damn, Doug and Trudy Judy.    
Look, I'm sorry, but it was grand larceny.    
I couldn't just let them get away with it.    
Well if you were gonna arrest them anyway, why bother with the reverse heist?    
It's like Trudy said.    
We didn't have the diamonds.
It wasn't enough evidence.    
But we put them back.    
Yeah, only because I was there.    
Not to mention the fact that I was fully complicit.    
I could've gone to jail.    
Wait, we destroyed your phone.    
- How did you call for backup?
- That was actually easy.    
When Doug was distracted, yelling at the concierge...    
Let me talk to my general manager.    
I swapped out my waterlogged phone for his. 
Damn, I would have noticed that if I wasn't trying to live in the moment and not look at my phone so much.    
And then when I was hidden in the cart, I called the cops.    
Mm, impossible. I would've heard you.    
Not with the Smush Shush!    
This is Jake Peralta.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.    
Foot cramp, foot cramp.    
First of all, how dare you!    
Second of all, would you call Barbara Corcoran and tell her this product is not useless?    
I don't know her. I'm sorry that I betrayed you, Doug, but I'm a cop. I didn't have a choice.    
- We can still be friends, right?
- I don't know.    
Did you even illegally download that O-Town album?    
No.    
I bought it at their concert.
Came bundled with a sweatshirt.    
- You make me sick.
- Disgusting.    
Doug!    
Trudy!    
Judy's!    
Hey, sir.    
I'm sure you're still mad at us.    
Just you, not Diaz.    
Okay, well, I can't get that card back, but I did bring you these.    
They're business cards of people you've helped.    
One mistake did not make you the cop you are today.    
   years of service to the community did.    
That should be your motivation.    
I know you can't remember their names, but...    
Alex Chen. I do remember him.    
  -year-old male, carjacked at the corner of  th Avenue and   th Street.    
Had three siblings, Alice, Arlene, and Anna.    
Okay, so you remember Alex Chen.    
Yes, and I really helped him.
Perhaps he'll be my new Zeff.    
Welcome back, Captain Holt.    
I'm really glad we could help you with this.    
Oh, no, you're not gonna just jump back in here now that it all worked out!    
- Thank you, Diaz.
- No!    
No, thank Terry. I did this!    
Oh, I'm done. You know what,    
I did all of this. This was all me!    
This is ridiculous!    
- We barely got to know her.
- And now we never will.    
I feel so bad for them, but what do you say to someone that's suffered this kind of loss?    
I mean, it's kind of on them for not checking the voltage on a machine that has a built in air-fryer.    
Don't blame the victim, Amy.    
Okay, guys, look. I know this is sad, but maybe everything happens for a reason.    
What reason could there possibly be for the pain I'm feeling?    
Look, I probably shouldn't be telling you this because I know you'll abuse it, but when there's no third machine, you can come back here and do this.    
Everything happens for a reason.    
Peralta! You have to see this.    
Guy got brought in this morning.    
Look what we found on him.    
Yeah, I get it, Rosa.    
Every perp in the city is invited and I'm not.    
But I... wait a minute, why is my name on this?    
'Cause you're coming to the wedding, baby!    
What's going on?
You're not mad at me anymore?    
I arrested your best man.    
Just like I wanted you to.    
I was putting on a show in front of Trudy.    
What?    
Katherine, my fiancée, doesn't want any of my crook friends coming to the wedding.    
She's a federal judge, how would that look?    
Okay, but couldn't you just tell them they're not invited?    
Eh... that's an uncomfortable conversation to have.    
It was much easier this way.    
Oh, my God.
This whole thing was a set up?    
You wanted me to find that invitation.    
Mm-hmm.    
You knew I would never go on a trip with a bunch of crooks unless I felt unwanted.    
Classic negging.    
I bet you planned to have your bachelor party at that hotel because you knew the oligarch was staying there.    
Hell, yeah, otherwise I would've got an Airbnb.    
And as soon as your friends committed a crime, you banked on me needing to arrest them.    
Damn right. You're the most consistent person in my life, Peralta.    
I can always count on you.    
But, there is one detail you missed.    
You never saw what I was painting on the inside of my mug at the pottery place.    
""Will you be my best man""?

Sir, I'd like to talk to you about the new task force you're on the hiring committee for.  
The Special Tactical Operations and Auxiliary  
Strategic Response Citywide Emergency  
Investigative Unit for Emergency Operations?  
You know, I had a hand in naming it.  
And it's great, although you might wanna try shortening it,maybe using a cool acronym.  
So the S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.?   
Hm, you're right. That is cool.   
Sure, anyways, I know some of the best cops in the city are gonna be on that task force, and I would appreciate it if you'd consider me for it.   
Here's my résumé.   
And I thought it would be fun if I rapped it.   
But then I realized that would be a terrible idea, so I just wrote it down normally.   
It'll probably rhyme a lot on accident.
Try not to focus on that.   
""Jake Peralta is age   , but professionally,

Charles, it's not a rap. It never was.   
Everyone's professional here.   
Not the lyrics we discussed either.   
Anyways, sir, I really think that I deserve this task force.   
My clearance rate puts me in the top  % of all NYPD det...   
I am aware of your qualifications, Peralta, but I'm only allowed to recommend one name for the S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.   
And you don't think the acronym's just a little clunky?   
Oh, no, it's quite catchy.   
Look, I really feel like I've got what it takes.   
I'm experienced, I'm hardworking, and I'm unflappable in the face of...

Oh, my God! What was that?

- [alarm blaring]
- Scully, are you hurt?   
- Is that blood?
- It's glitter.   
There was a box on Jake's desk.   
I opened it, and it just exploded.   
I can't feel my face.   
And, not to be rude, but is that something you can normally feel?   
Oh, right. I guess I'm fine.   
Jeffords, evacuate the precinct.   
- I'll contact the bomb squad.
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.   
I think this actually might have been a prank that malfunctioned.   
Look, the box was connected to a tank of compressed air under the desk.   
It was supposed to shoot glitter at whoever opened it, but something must have clogged the pressure release valve,   
- and the tank exploded.
- Wow.   
The silver lining is no one got hurt.   
And the lead lining is that this prank caused significant property damage in the precinct.   
Fair point, but we do shatter a lot of glass around here.   
Either it's Rosa who's disappointed in her Buzzfeed results...   
I am not a Blanche.   
Or Charles trying to bro out...   
Hut, think fast, dude.   
Or just Terry gently shutting a window and forgetting how strong he is.   
- And look at this.
Evidence was compromised.   
Oh no, the shirt from the Dekalb Street murder.   
That's the only hard evidence we have.   
ADA Green's already mad we didn't find anything else.   
Why is this on your desk, Peralta?   
I logged it out for trial, but Officer Howard is the one who got it from the evidence locker.   
Let's blame him.
He's always up to no good.   
What? You don't even know me.   
- Yes, I do.
- Then what's my last name?   
I thought it was Howard.   
It's Booth. My name is Howard Booth.   
Okay, fine, but just so you know, the only thing I'm gonna remember from this interaction is that you put me on the spot, so...   
Sir, I know this is important, but I kinda gotta go.   
Cagney and Lacey's recorder concert's in an hour and I promised that I...   
No one leaves until the culprit is brought to justice.   
But they're playing ""Uptown Funk.""   
I wouldn't care if they were playing actual music.   
Whoever did this was obviously someone Peralta pranked seeking revenge.   
Who are his recent victims?   
[chuckles]   
I'm sorry, but I'm the Prankmaster General and I take that role very seriously.   
Look at this. There's a note.    
It says, ""Gotcha back, babe.""
It was Amy.    
Who else would call Jake ""babe""?    
Charles went through that year-long phase where he called everybody ""babe.""    
- Uh-huh.
- I forget.    
- Did you guys like that?
- [together] No.    
I still think it was Amy.    
Obviously I'm being framed, probably by whomever keeps accusing me.    
No one's asking the obvious question.    
Why did Scully open a package on Peralta's desk?    
Perhaps he was setting up the prank, and it blew up in his face.    
[all muttering in agreement]    
No, I just saw a box and I thought,    
""Oh, cookies come in boxes.""    
[all muttering in agreement]    
I bet it wasn't anyone in this squad.    
That's exactly what a guilty person would say.    
So in order to prove my innocence,    
- I just need to start pointing fingers?
- Mm-hmm.    
- Fine, it was Amy.
- Really?    
Because the ""Babe"" thing screams you, Charles.    
Oh, you wanna hear screaming?
It was Amy!    
- [overlapping shouting]
- Somebody confess!    
[siren whoops]    
[in German accent] Well, well, well.    
What do we have here?    
It appears a crime has been committed, and no one will confess.    
- Doing a German accent?
- I was going for Belgian,    
Like in ""Murder on the Orient Express.""    
You sound like a Nazi.    
Okay, not a great note to hear.    
I'll just use my normal voice.    
The point is a crime has been committed, and someone in this room did it.    
There are seven suspects all with means and motive.    
It appears what we have is a classic whodunit.    
The phrase ""whodunit"" is a grammatical abomination.    
Please use the proper term, a ""who has done this.""    
I will not, however, in order to solve this case, we need the very finest of detectives, one with a unique set of skills, someone named...    
Dillman! I'll call Dillman!    
Who?

♪ ♪ 
I hear you need some help with a ""who has done this.""    
Squad, meet detective Frank Dillman of the San Francisco PD.    
He is in town, and we were supposed to have lunch tomorrow, but I asked him to come down because I need an objective set of eyes on this.    
- I can be objective.
- Then tell me.    
- How do I look today?
- Normal?    
No. Dillman?    
- Bloated.
- Thank you.    
Dillman is the single best detective    
I have ever worked with.    
Sadly, he was unjustly fired for investigating corruption in the NYPD.    
He hated dirty cops so much they used to call him Mr. Clean.    
Uh-huh, I'm sure that's the only reason they called him that.    
Because I'm bald?
You think that's funny?    
I started shaving my head   years ago in solidarity with my mother who was undergoing chemotherapy.    
Oh, look, I'm so sorry...    
I'm obviously lying.    
It's classic male pattern baldness.    
But now, based on your reaction,    
I know every single thing about you as a person.    
- That can't be true.
- It is.    
- You're cooked.
- All right, let's get started.    
I want written statements from every witness... personnel files for the entire squad.    
Of course, I need to have this desk dusted for prints, see if we get a hit on the AFI system.    
Somebody could maybe get rid of those pigeons.    
And, of course, I'll need to see any surveillance video.    
Unfortunately, this area's a blind spot.    
The camera that covers it broke two weeks ago, and it hasn't been fixed yet.    
Really don't want me to see that security footage, do you, Lieutenant?    
- Hm, I wonder why.
- I was just stating the facts.    
I didn't do anything to the camera.    
I never thought you did, but now I know every single thing about you as a person.    
Everyone back off.    
Dillman has the scene.    
♪ ♪ 
Man, this sucks.    
This case would have been the perfect chance for you to prove to Holt that you deserve that task force.    
Yeah. Maybe it still is.    
Holt thinks Dillman's the best detective he's ever worked with, so what happens if I solve the case before him?    
Then I become the best detective Holt has ever worked with, and he has to give me the task force.    
Dillman thinks he knows everything about me as a person, but there's one thing he doesn't know.    
I'm about to take him down...    
Oh, my God, he's staring right at us.    
Quick, pretend like I was saying something else.    
Yes, Jake, you were young when you lost your virginity.    
Thank you, Charles!    
The DA's office called. Greene is furious.    
He thinks he may have to drop all charges in the Dekalb case.    
Whoever did this is facing a massive suspension, and there's no use hiding because Dillman will smoke you out.    
Right, but is there any way he could hurry it up?    
So far it's just been a lot of silent pacing.    
Would you ask a heart surgeon to hurry it up?    
I mean, I would if he was just walking around a room.    
Okay, here's what we know.    
The glitter bomb was placed between   :   and   :  .    
All the suspects say they were at lunch and have an alibi for that time, which means one of you is lying.    
It was Terry.    
Thanks for coming by, Dill, but I got it from here.    
You see, Terrence, I couldn't help but notice you're not wearing suspenders today... odd, considering suspenders are your entire personality.    
Seems a little reductive.    
I had a rough childhood, but I lifted myself up through arts and athletics...    
Ah-buh-buh-buhp.
You're the suspenders guy.    
Something felt fishy, so Jakey went fishing, and I caught me a fat one.    
And look at that...    
Terry's suspenders stuffed into his desk drawer, and there's glitter on them... red glitter.    
Feels like that deserved an audible gasp.    
- [gasps loudly]
- Thank you, Charles.    
You got messy setting up the prank.    
You didn't want anyone to see.    
You put the suspenders in your desk drawer.    
Case closed.    
Did you put that folder there just so you could close it?    
Yes, Rosa, obviously.    
I didn't do anything.    
Well, if you didn't do anything, how come the case is closed?    
- It's not.
- Hm?    
The glitter on Jeffords' suspenders is type  A round red glitter while the bomb spewed    
type  C round red glitter, but then I suppose all round red glitter looks the same to you.    
No. I know the difference.    
- One is bigger?
- Shinier.    
- Ah.
- The number refers to the size.    
The letter refers to its reflective qualities.    
Seems like you know a weird amount about glitter, man.    
So good detective work is weird to you?    
Interesting squad you have here, Raymond.    
I didn't choose them.
They were here when I arrived.    
Understood. The real question is why Jeffords had glitter on him at all.    
Fortunately, I have the answer.    
I deduced that he has three young daughters... twins and a toddler.    
Big deal.
You saw the picture on his desk.    
I did, and judging by the maple trees in the background of that picture, it was taken last fall... probably mid October.    
The twins are smiling, each revealing a missing tooth.    
The twin on the right... let's call her ""Twin A.""    
- That's Cagney.
- Is that relevant?    
- It's her name.
- So no.    
Twin A is missing an upper right incisor while Twin B is missing a lower left incisor    
suggesting that they were seven when the photo was taken, which would put them in second grade.    
Spring semester of second grade is when    
the Brooklyn schools do their solar system unit, a highlight of which is constructing a mobile of the planets.    
My hypothesis is that Twin A and Twin B requested    
Daddy's help making Mars sparkle, hence the red glitter.    
Damn, yeah, that's exactly right.    
Just seems like a very complicated way    
- of saying Terry has kids.
- Thank you.    
What?    
The point is, Jeffords is innocent,    
so I guess it's fair to say case open.    
My God, I have gooseflesh.    
So now I'd like to move on to a real suspect.    
I wanna see detective Diaz in the box.    
- [gasps]
- What... don't gasp for him.    
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.    
- It just slipped out.
- Title of your s*x tape.    
Yeah, it's... obviously it's the title of his s*x tape.    
Everyone's taking my stuff.    
[tense music] 
♪ ♪ 
Dillman never talks first when he's in the box.    
Well, Rosa never initiates conversation of any kind.    
Guys, I really have to get out of here.    
Somebody please say something to get it started. 
- No.
- And there it is.    
Now that I have the upper hand, let's get started.    
Stupid Terry and his stupid kids.    
You were the only suspect who did not go out for lunch, but if you were eating at your desk, how did you not see the perpetrator plant the glitter bomb?    
I wasn't at my desk.
I was in the break room.    
Oh, the break room. That explains it.    
I guess we're done here.    
Oh, here it comes... the Dillman double back.    
Just to double back...    
Oh, my. He actually said the words.    
What a treat.    
If you were in the break room, why was the IP address of your laptop    
logged into the Wi-Fi on the fifth floor?    
Fine.    
There's an empty office there where I go to be alone.    
Seems innocent enough.
Why would you lie about that?    
Maybe because you were up there assembling a glitter bomb.    
[mumbles]    
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- I was watching a soap opera.    
It's called ""Drake's Hollow.""
I never miss an episode.    
It's my mother's favorite show, and when things were bad between us, it was the one thing    
- that we could still talk about.
- Oh, that's sweet.    
It is kind of sweet.    
Sweet enough to fool a lesser detective.    
What... I wasn't fooled. Take her away.    
If you really watch ""Drake's Hollow"" every day, you won't mind if I give you a little quiz.    
You see, I've been known to visit the Hollow myself from time to time not unlike Nicholas Van Bronderberg.    
Who's the father of Eliana's twins?    
Christian is Jacob's father, but Joshua was stolen from the hospital.    
His real father remains unknown.    
Who did Joshua grow up to marry?    
First came Sandra, then there was Brigitte, but she turned out to be his sister.    
Katherine died during childbirth, 
though it was later revealed that she was murdered 
by Amanda, Joshua's next wife. 
They divorced after Amanda was sentenced to the electric chair.    
But Joshua rebounded quickly with Jasmine.    
Jasmine was followed by Grace, the love of his life, but she had a contract dispute with the producers so she was killed off camera by a snake.    
[chuckles] You messed up.    
- You forgot Gwendolyn.
- No, I didn't.    
Joshua and Gwendolyn were technically never married because that whole season took place inside Kiki's mind...    
[whispering] While she was in a coma.    
Diaz is innocent. 
So I guess he was wrong about Rosa.    
Don't worry about Dillman.    
He's the best detective I've ever worked with.    
Or you just keep talking him up because you don't want us to notice how weird it is that you brought in a friend to work the case.    
We're not friends.    
My only friends are James and Julian.    
Hurtful, but I still think it's strange    
that you won't let me run the investigation... unless, of course, there's something    
- you're scared I might find.
- Excuse me?    
Where were you between   :   and   :  ?    
You aren't seriously suggesting that I am the prank man.    
It does seem a little far-fetched, Jake.    
I mean, he did just use the phrase, ""prank man.""    
It's not far-fetched at all.    
Holt is not the joyless robot that he once was.    
Is this about the time I ate a burrito?    
I was pressured into it.    
Just tell us where you were at lunch.    
Well, if you must know, I was having lunch with Boyle.    
[laughs] No way.    
You two are the second most unlikely    
Nine-Nine lunch combination.    
First is anyone with Hitchcock and Scully.    
Second is Holt and Charles.    
It is pretty strange.    
I mean, obviously it was uncomfortable, but it was a work lunch.    
Look, it's not a big deal, guys.    
We don't have to talk about it.    
I was offering him the task force position.    
Boyle is my choice.    
Boyle?    
From work?    
[chuckles] Oh.    
How great for him...
[laughs] And no one else.    
You know what, I just remembered that I'm late to leave.    
Gotta go, bye.    
Hey.    
I don't understand, Charles.    
If Holt already assigned you to the task force, why were you helping me try and get it?    
I was planning on telling Holt no.    
What? That's insane.    
It's a huge opportunity.    
I know, but I've been meaning to cut back on hours.    
I'm working too much.    
It's affecting Nikolaj at school.    
He's been making so many new friends.    
Wait, isn't that a good thing?    
No, he's trying to get me jealous.    
I did the same thing to my dad.    
So, Jake, for real.    
I'm not gonna take the assignment.    
[sighs] Okay, I guess that makes sense.    
But just promise me you're not turning it down because of me.    
Jake, I promise.    
Okay.    
Great, well, if you're turning it down, that means there's still    
an opportunity for me to solve the case and prove to Holt I belong on the task force.    
- What task force?
- BOTH: [surprised grunt]    
- How long have you been here?
- Just a few seconds.    
But that was more than enough time for me to ascertain everything about you...    
As a person, yes, we know. No one likes a know-it-all.    
You're married to one.    
- You're married to one.
- Follow me.    
I have an important announcement to make.    
BOTH: Dillman.    
May I have everyone's attention please?    
I have solved the, ""who has done this.""    
I know by whom it was done.    
- It was Jake Peralta.
- What?    
That's crazy. The box was on my desk.    
- I'm the victim.
- Wrong.    
- Scully's the victim.
- You know, you think glitter's gonna taste like sprinkles, but it doesn't.    
- It tastes like blood.
- That is blood.    



The glitter's shredding your tongue.    
Oh.    
Why would I blow up my own desk?    
For the task force.    
I just heard you say you wanted to prove to Holt that you're a great detective.    
That's why you set this whole thing up.    
It was a perfect plan, and you would've gotten away with it if not for me.    
Wow. You're a lunatic.    
Would a lunatic know that your body temperature just rose  /   of a degree indicating guilt?    
- Yes.
- Oh, look.    
What do we have here... a receipt from Party Zone    
for one air tank rental paid in cash.    
That's not mine.
I never keep my receipts.    
Amy, tell them. Tell them how much our accountant hates me.    
She hates him so much.    
My bag was sitting next to my desk.    
Anyone could have put that in there.    
That kind of evidence would never hold up at trial.    
You'd be laughed out of court.    
I've only been laughed at in court once, and that was because I made a terrific joke.    
- I was there. It was hilarious.
- Come on.    
I guess it's fair to say case closed.    
No. He stole that from me.    
Go home. You're suspended until further notice.    
This is nuts.    
I can't believe Holt believes that ridiculous windbag and his sack of lies.    
Oh, I know everything about glitter and ""Drake's Elbow.""    
- ""Hollow.""
- Amy, please.    
I just need your support right now, okay?    
Wait a minute, you believe me, right?    
Of course I do. I'm your wife.    
I'm on your side no matter what.    
[sighs] Thanks.    
- Same, by the way.
- Thanks.    
I mean, no one really suspects me.    
- Right.
- Look, go home.    
I'll check for prints on the Party Zone receipt.    
Yours won't be there, but maybe someone else's will.    
Wait a minute. Prints... that's it.    
- I think I know who framed me.
- Who?    
I can't say yet. I wanna be sure.    
You wanna do a big, dramatic reveal in front of everyone, don't you?    
Yes, obviously.    
Look, I have to check on one thing.    
- Don't let anybody leave.
- Okay.    
[elevator dings] 
[in German accent] Attention, everyone.    
Stop what you are doing.    
[normally] Eh, still a little Nazi.    
I'm gonna just drop the accent.    
Peralta, you can't be here.
You're suspended.    
And you're lucky it's not worse.    
The DA's office wanted you fired.    
I'm being framed, and I know who did it.    
It was Dillman!    
[scoffs] I just met you today.    
- Why would I do that?
- Good question.    
It's because you want Holt to put you on that task force.    
Dillman can't be on a New York task force.    
The SFPD would never approve it.    
Correct, only he's not SFPD.    
When you first arrived, you asked us to check the fingerprints against the AFI system, but that system hasn't been used in over five years by any police department.    
Well, I used the AFI system for    years.    
- I guess I misspoke.
- Oh, misspoke.    
I see. That explains everything.
My apologies.    
I'm just gonna head back on out to exile... just to double back.    
My God. He's double backing Dillman.    
How could the best detective that Holt's ever worked with make such a mistake?    
I wondered myself, so I made a few phone calls.    
It turns out, Dillman was fired by the SFPD.    
I guess he rubbed the brass the wrong way.    
Not only that, but he's currently working part time at Yarn Barn, a hobby shop in Albany.    
I have his manager on the phone right now.    
Frank, what is going on?
You have a shift tonight. 
You know I have finals. 
[stammers] I'm so sorry, Alyssa.    
I got hung up in the city.
I just lost track of time.    
This explains everything.
He's not a great detective.    
He's a sad man working part time selling crafting supplies.    
Okay, fine, yes.
I was fired by the SFPD.    
And yes, I contacted Raymond in hopes of getting on that task force.    
I thought it would be my way back onto the NYPD.    
Oh, my God. I hate the Yarn Barn.    
Really disappointing to hear, Frank, 
Yeah, well you're a bad manager, Alyssa, okay?    
You play favorites and it hurts to be on the outside.    
- You don't even show up to...
- Okay.    
I was gonna bring up the task force when I had lunch with Raymond tomorrow, but when he called about this case,    
I thought solving it would seal the deal...    
Which would have been easy since you set the whole thing up to frame me.    
Ridiculous.    
Why would I have waited so long to accuse you?    
Because if you solved it right away, it would've been too obvious.    
He's deflecting because he's guilty.    
Dillman lied about where he worked.    
We can't trust him.    
The receipt was in Peralta's bag.    
You're the glitter expert.    
Well, you're the Prankmaster General.    
- BOTH: It was him.
- [siren whoops]    
It wasn't either of you, but I know who it was.    
Son of a bitch stole my bullhorn.    
Okay, I'm not    % sure this is right, and maybe I'm missing something...    
Charles, as a veteran of many big reveals, can I give you a tip?    
- Not so much waffling.
- I agree.    
You're not commanding the room.    
Let him finish... his way.    
- But do pace it up a bit, Charles.
- Copy that.    
So from the beginning, I was very skeptical that anyone in our squad was behind the prank.    
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I did, and then you said,    
""That's exactly what a guilty person would say.""    
Eh, I stand by it.    
Okay, so who was the prank man?    
There was no prank.    
That was just a cover.    
You see, guys, the point of the explosion was to contaminate the evidence of the Dekalb Street murder.    
But the suspect is in prison, has no ties to organized crime, and no means of bribing an officer.    
How could he have possibly pulled that off?    
Yeah, Jake, that stumped me for a little bit too, but then something you said gave me an idea.    
I mean, that kind of evidence would never hold up at trial.    
You'd be laughed out of court.    
Ah, yeah, I remember when I said that.    
It was awesome. Wait, but who did it?    
The mastermind was ADA Greene.    
He didn't have enough evidence for the case.    
He was afraid he was gonna lose and needed someone to blame it on.    
Whom did he work with... obviously someone who knew about the pranks and that Amy called Jake ""babe.""    
Excellent question, Captain.    
It took a little digging to find that out, but I pulled some personnel files and combed through some social media.    
Do you know what Greene's wife's maiden name is?    
- Duchovny?
- No.    
- Zappa.
- No.    
- Fagerbakke.
- No, Booth.    
Howard Booth... as in, Officer Booth.    
Oh, yes. Officer Howard.    
He's Greene's brother-in-law.    
He didn't just put the evidence on Jake's desk.    
- He put the glitter bomb there.
- Oh, my God.    
- We have to find Booth.
- Already did it.    
And I booked him.    
- [elevator dings]
- Oh, classic elevator reveal.    
This feels like it calls for an audible gasp.    
- [gasps loudly]
- Not from you, Charles.    
From me. [gasps loudly]    
[gasps loudly]    
Wait, did you just gasp at my gasp?    
Sorry. Your gasp was so good.    
Oh, thank you for gasping at my gasp.    
My pleasure.    
Sorry you missed your daughter's concert.    
No, no, it's okay.    
Sharon totally understood...after I lied to her and said we had to stay late because Rosa got shot.    
Next time you see her, walk with a limp.    
Copy that.    
Hey, you know you don't have to sweep up, right?    
Well, someone's gotta.    
Plus it reminds me of the three years I spent as a cleaning lady in college.    
Huh, I guess there really is no term for cleaning man.    
- Mm-mm.
- That's not great.    
So hey, listen.    
I wanted to say great job today and also I'm sorry.    
Sorry for what?    
Well, when I heard you got the task force, my first reaction was just to feel sad for myself instead of happy for you.    
Well, you sure hid it well.    
I really didn't.    
I stormed into the other room and moped by myself.    
Eh, but you had style.    
Charles, no. Look.    
You have to take the task force job.    
Really? What about Nikolaj?    
He's gonna be so proud of his dad.    
I bet he even ditches those new friends.    
Oh, man. That's the dream.    
Thank you for saying that.    
Honestly, though, I still don't get why Holt chose me over you.    
Are you kidding?
I mean, just look at today.    
Instead of fighting for attention, you did the work and methodically built your case.    
You noticed things that a room full of seasoned cops all missed.    
You're a great detective, Charles.    
Wow.    
Even in defeat, you are a true prince of a man.    
- The task force is yours.
- What? No.    
- Boyle, just take the win!
- Right.    
It was good to see you today.    
I'll keep my ears open for any job opportunities that arise.    
Appreciate it. I could use it.    
Just got a text from Alyssa, I've been fired by the Yarn Barn.    
Well, you still the best damn detective I've ever worked with.    
Thank you.    
Wait a minute.    
Your iris just contracted by  /  th of a millimeter.    
You're lying.    
Yes, I've lost a lot of respect for you today.    
Understood.    
Goodbye, Raymond.    
Well... [sighs]    
Since Dillman is clearly out of the top spot now, who's the best detective you've ever worked with?    
It's Sergeant Leslie Hunt-Minkoff.    
Who?
